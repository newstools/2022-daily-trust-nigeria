 Seventy five inmates of the Ibara Maximum Security Custodial Centre, Old Abeokuta, Ogun State, have bagged diploma certificates in theology. It was gathered that the inmates underwent a six-month training with a seminary geared towards reforming and rehabilitating them. The programme, which was organised by an NGO, Right Thinkers Initiative (RTI), was a combined effort of ministers of God who regularly visited the centre to teach the prisoners. At the graduation ceremony held in the premises of the custodial centre, the National Director of Right Thinkers Initiative, Dr Olamide Emmanuel, said the programme was an effort to reform and rehabilitate criminal minds.
