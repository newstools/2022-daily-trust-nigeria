A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, said the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will support whoever emerges as the party’s presidential candidate for the 2023 polls if the process is free and fair. Speaking with newsmen after submitting the expression of interest and nomination forms for Tinubu at the International Conference Centre (ICC) yesterday in Abuja, Babachir said the APC national leader was 100 per cent prepared for the primary. He said, “He (Tinubu) is a democrat, every politician should not be afraid of election because the probability is either you win or loss. So, if we lose at the convention, we will go back home, we will lick our wounds and prepare to support the winner if he wins in a free and fair manner.” Babachir further said the former Lagos governor was not fazed by the growing list of APC presidential aspirants, adding that, “We will carry the majority of the delegates at the convention.” Tinubu’s forms were submitted on his behalf by a team of his supporters led by the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Babashir Lawal and a member of the House of Representatives, Hon James Faleke, were part of the team. I’m trusting God to emerge flag bearer – Bakare Running mate to Gen Muhammadu Buhari (Rtd) in the 2011 presidential election, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has said he is trusting God to emerge the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 general elections. Bakare, who spoke with newsmen yesterday in Abuja after submitting his expression of interest and nomination forms, said: “Anyone who participates in a race must run according to the rules. My chances are as bright as that of any person. I am eminently qualified either by age or experience or everything that counts in this race. And I trust God that I will emerge the winner.”
