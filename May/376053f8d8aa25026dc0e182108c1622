An ‎All Progressives Congress ( APC) gubernatorial aspirant in Kaduna State, Alhaji Sani Mohammad Sha’aban, ‎has rejected the party’s delegates’ list, saying there was no congresses held in the state. Sha’aban, who is an in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari, said his campaign organisation had petitioned the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) over the alleged non-conduct of congresses in the state. He said his campaign organisation tried to submit a petition to the party’s Congress Appeal committee during their visit but were denied access to the hotel. Sha’aban spoke through his Campaign Organization Director-General, Barrister Joshua Danladi Ephraim. The aspirant explained further that the reason for sending a petition to INEC was to put it on record that the APC in Kaduna allegedly failed to comply with one of the requisite constituents of the electoral Act 2022 as contained in the party’s Guidelines in its choice of indirect Primaries for the nomination of its candidates for the 2023 general
election. The five-man Appeal Committee for the Ad-hoc Delegate Congresses, on Saturday, upheld the state APC Congress in the state, describing the exercise as very successful. The five-man Committee headed by Mrs Tinuke Gbadejo Ogunrinde described the congresses as hitch-free with no petition received before, during and after the congresses. The Chairman further said the various categories of delegates emerged from the Special Congress in the 23 local government areas as follows: 1,275 Local Government Delegates, 1,275 State Delegates and 69 National Delegates were unanimously elected during the Special
Congress by consensus.
