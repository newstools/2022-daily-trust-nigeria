Two newly upgraded first class traditional rulers, HRM Mallam Muhammed Momoh Ganaguda, the Ohinoyi of Girinya Okpambana Okoro; and HRM Alhaji Muhammed Abba Alhassan the Onyiwo of Gegu-Beki, have commended Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, for upgrading them to first class status, noting that by action the governor has liberated the Egbira race. Speaking when the two traditional rulers and their members of their traditional councils paid a visit to the governor at the government house in Lokoja on Tuesday, Alhaji Muhammed said upgrading them had brought more unity among Egbira people across the country. Responding, Gov Bello appreciated the monarch’s and their traditional councils for the visit. He called on them to continue to ensure peace and unity in their respective domains, while also urging them to continue to be security conscious and report suspicious persons to relevant security agents.
