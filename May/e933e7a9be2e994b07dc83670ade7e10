The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) says it is willing to deploy its expertise to assist the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) to establish dairy processing factories in Sokoto, Kano and Imo States in its efforts to develop some commercial projects through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Director General of the BPE, Mr. Alex A. Okoh disclosed this during a courtesy visit to the Comptroller General (CG) of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), Haliru Nababa at the NCoS headquarters, Abuja yesterday. Okoh said: “BPE with more than 30 years’ experience in the reform and optimisation of federal government’s assets through different strategies is ready to collaborate with the service actively by   offering  its technical expertise and experience  to ensure the successful execution and completion of the concession process for   the projects” The projects, according to him, are: Cattle ranching and dairy processing factories in three states – Sokoto, Kano and Imo; agricultural farms in many states of the federation; industrial entities and the correctional centres’ land swapping projects. In his response, the Comptroller General, Haliru Nababa, represented by the Deputy Comptroller General (DCG), Operations (Non-Custodial Duties), Mohammed A. Tukur, said the projects were dear to the NCoS as they would transform and strengthen the institutions of the NCoS because of their potential to unlock the value of the Service and the federal government at large.
