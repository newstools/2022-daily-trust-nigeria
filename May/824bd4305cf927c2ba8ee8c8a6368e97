Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State says while he does not have money to purchase private jets for monarchs or hard currencies to splash around for citizens, he is endowed with the capacity to transform Osun through good governance. Oyetola, while speaking at the Palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, during the flag-off of his re-election campaign in Ile-Ife, said Osun is too sophisticated to be governed by kindergarten politicians seeking to experiment with it. He added that because he is a man of peace and believes in the fact that politics is not a do-or-die affair, he is not interested in the fire-for-fire approach espoused by a certain governorship aspirant. “I am happy that the Ooni knows that I have good intentions to govern this state. I may not be able to buy private jets, but I have all it takes to fix Osun. I don’t have hard currencies to splash around and I don’t believe in a fire-for-fire approach, but I am confident of victory in the next governorship election because of the modest achievements of our administration and the wide acceptance from our people in the last three-and-a-half years,” he said.
