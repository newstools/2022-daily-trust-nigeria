The national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reconciled the prolonged political rivalry between Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara and his predecessor, Abdul’aziz Yari. The breakthrough came on Monday after the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) met with the two disputing politicians. The Zamfara State chapter of the APC has been embroiled in a protracted political crisis forcing the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Progressives Governors’ Forum. A truce had also been brokered in February between former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Marafa, but wasn’t sustained. Speaking after the meeting, Adamu said the two political lords of the state agreed to work together to move their party forward. He said, “They have agreed to work together for the success of our great party. We have informed the 0resident of the progress that we are making and I am grateful to the Almighty God that we have been able to reach an accord between the former governor, current governor and their esteemed followers. “We have every reason to thank God and believe that the 2023 general elections in Zamfara State is a given for the APC. “My advice is that we should be careful not to go back to where we are coming from. We must learn to respect one another, respect the views of our party followers who are our greatest assets. “To the former and current governor, you have a duty to sustain the spirit of understanding, togetherness and teamwork. On behalf of my colleagues, I commend this very useful agreement that we have reached.”
