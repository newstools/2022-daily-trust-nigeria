 A female governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State, Imah Nsa Adegoke, has said none of the male aspirants in the state can intimidate her. She stated this when she displayed her PDP provisional clearance certificate, campaign team and supporters in Calabar, the state capital. Ms Adegoke, who was the first female to be cleared by the PDP gubernatorial screening committee, said she had all it took, including clout, sagacity and resources to withstand and prosecute her governorship aspiration next year. She said, “I cannot see anybody among the array of male aspirants, no matter their pedigree, that can intimidate me. I refuse to accept such insinuation of whether I do not feel intimidated. We are here to change the status quo, and by God’s grace we will win.”
