Two weeks after Okada riders and traders clashed at Dei Dei Marker in Abuja, a similar incident has occurred in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Trouble started after a motorist crushed two motorcyclists to death around Global Estate, Dakwo, Galadimawa area  at about 1:30 pm on Sunday. To avoid the wrath of other Okada riders, the motorist reportedly fled into the Estate, while his attackers chased him. There were reports that angry Okada riders destroyed properties in the estate and set houses on fire. But FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, said no house was torched in the incident. She admitted that the Okada riders attacked the estate, but said normalcy was restored after the Police intervened. She said the Commissioner of Police, in charge of the FCT, Mr Babaji Sunday, went to the scene with heavy deployment of operatives to restore normalcy in the area. “It is imperative to equally state that contrary to information filtering about, no house was burnt,” she said. Adeh pledged the commitment of the command to ensure safety of lives and property within the FCT. She enjoined the public to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses without fear of harassment and molestation of any kind from any quarters. (NAN)
