An All Progressive Congress (APC) Gubernatorial Aspirant in Kaduna State, Alhaji Sani Mahmud Sha’aban, has rejected the endorsement of Senator Uba Sani by Governor Nasir El-Rufai. Daily Trust had exclusively reported how El-Rufai anointed the senator representing Kaduna Central as his preferred successor. Sha’aban described the endorsement as unacceptable and undemocratic, saying nobody can force any aspirant on the people of the state. According to him, 99 percent of the party members are not happy with the decision, adding that he rejected it because it will render all the party delegates useless. Speaking at a news briefing, he said President Muhammadu Buhari and the national leadership of the party will not accept dictatorship anywhere. Sha’aban said if the governor has respect for the APC, he should allow for a free and fair primary election to hold. “I’m the first in APC in Kaduna State to purchase the form; nobody has call or invited me to come for any discussion. If they have respect for me, at least I’m a stakeholder. I can’t be treated as nobody. I know my rights; I earned it.” “I deserve even if a telephone call to say, ‘this is what we intend to do’. When you rubbish me, I rubbish you. At the national level, Mr President will not accept dictatorship. We shouldn’t behave as if we don’t have leaders. APC has respected leadership at the national level. Nobody can impose anybody on anyone. What we want is democracy and is what is going to be done,” he said. His Campaign Director, Joshua Danladi Ephraim, called on the party leaders to monitor the affairs of the state, saying all they are asking for is an enabling environment for a free and fair primary election.
