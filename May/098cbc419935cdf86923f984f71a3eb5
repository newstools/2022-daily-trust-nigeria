The Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, has expressed optimism that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will come up with a position on the zoning of the presidential ticket. The minister spoke yesterday while responding to questions from State House reporters after joining other residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on a Sallah homage to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Disquiet in Lagos, Ebonyi APC over endorsement of Sanwo-Olu, speaker Inflation: Union leaders want review of N30,000 minimum wage Akume was asked to speak on the remarks of the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the party had not taken any decision on the zoning of its presidential ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections. Akume said: “Basically, I think what you say is that he is not a lone ranger. There are organs and structures of the party that handle these sensitive issues. “If you remember our own junior partners are not having it easy at all, they started before us, but they haven’t made any headway. I believe and sincerely trust that our party will come up with a position that is acceptable to all.” Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had said just before the last national convention of the party that even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.
