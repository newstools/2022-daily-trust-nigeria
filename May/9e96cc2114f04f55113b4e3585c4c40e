Governor Badaru of Jigawa State has said that President Muhammadu Buhari sleeps and wakes up with the common man in his heart. Badaru, who is the chairman APC Governorship primaries, stated this during interview with Channels TV’s Politics Today. Badaru said, “President Buhari ran this government with the fear of God and to the best of his ability. And he sleeps and wakes up with the common man in his heart; how can he improve the life of the common man. That much I know and because of people will see the sincerity of what we are doing and understand the circumstances. “We inherited a dead country and resuscitated it. When we came in, 26 states were not paying salaries. Even then there were earning close to $80 par barrel. Nigerians know what these people had done and they will never vote for PDP again.” Badaru added that in 2023 Nigerians would vote APC back to power because they have the history what PDP did to the country. He added, “They have the history of what transpired between 1999 to date. They will vote us back to power because they know we’re committed to their cause. “Nigeria was an economy that was import-dependent before we came in, completely being oil-dependent. And our sense of income is in sense of crude oil. We’re selling crude oil at $100 to $140 par barrel and we’re using that dollar to import almost everything we use. “Then suddenly prices crushed. Our demand, taste and income value didn’t fall, but the dollar revenue fall down and that economy we had no reserve to take care of what is happening. What miracle could have happened. Is Buhari the person that causes that top happen?”
