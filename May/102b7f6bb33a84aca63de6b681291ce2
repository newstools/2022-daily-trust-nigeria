CHI Limited has made an entry into the kids’ segment with the launch of Chivita Smart Malt Drink, it announced in a statement. The company said the malt drink gave children the right portion of energy to learn and play, while also enjoying its great taste. According to health experts, children need energy and stamina to go on with their day just like adults do. They have a short attention span, and therefore need a lot of focus to pay attention in their classes. During physical education, they may participate in activities that require a lot of energy. The firms said the new malt drink ensures an active mind, keeping them energetic all through the day. Children will enjoy the appeal, ease and convenience of Chivita Smart Malt Drink in its 125ml aseptic pack as its naturally tasty and satisfying experience also provides energy to learn and the energy to play. Toyin Nnodi, CHI Limited’s marketing director, stated that the Chivita brand had always been innovative and very consumer-centric, and that the company was excited about the opportunity to grow the portfolio with the launch of Smart Malt Drink targeted at children. “Children need vigour and stamina to concentrate in their learning sessions or participate in physical activities, Chivita Smart Malt drink would provide them with healthy energy required to succeed, play, concentrate and learn all day,” she said. CHI Limited also said the malt drink can be consumed by young children with or without meals. “It is perfect for inclusion in their lunchboxes, picnic boxes, after school activities, family days out; and can fuel them with the right energy to concentrate, learn and play,” it added.
