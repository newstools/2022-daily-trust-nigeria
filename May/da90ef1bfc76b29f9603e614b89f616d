The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, has said the use of verifiable measuring scales to sell tubers and other agricultural products will soon commence to ensure that buyers derive maximum value for their money. The minister, who made the remark during a press conference to commemorate the 2022 World Metrology Day at the weekend in Abuja, stated that this was to prevent sharp practices during trade and allow sellers get the correct amounts for their products. Adebayo noted that the use of scales in trade was to allow worldwide uniformity of measurement and ensure comparability of measurements and promote trade through the reduction of barriers. “Metrology or the science of measurement has contributed immensely to the economic and social development of our society. In the economic space, accurate measurement ensures accountability in the determination of the quantity of mineral resources produced in the country; ensures that the quantity of goods and products purchased by consumers are accurate and just; ensures consumers’ protection and safety in the aviation sector and ensures that the amount of active ingredients in medicines are accurately determined for the safety of lives and well-being of users.”
