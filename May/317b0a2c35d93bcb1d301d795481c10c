A presidential aspirant on the platform of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyin, has withdrawn from the race. Speaking at an event in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital yesterday, Oguntoyin, an entrepreneur, said he withdrew from the race to support the presidential ambition of former Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso. “I Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyinbo, having considered many things, and in the interest of our great party and beloved country, today, relinquish my presidential ambition to support the presidential candidacy of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. “I pledge my loyalty at all times to the course of serving our party and country first as presidential running mate and eventually vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said.
