Bauchi State Governor and a presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bala Muhammed, has said that he is not ready to step down for any aspirant for the PDP presidential ticket. The governor gave his opinion while speaking with Arise TV on Saturday about the possibility of the emergence of a consensus candidate from the north-eastern presidential aspirants at the PDP National Convention which holds at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. He said, “I am not stepping down for anybody. I am not going to be a northeastern president, but a Nigerian president. Nobody has my pedigree among all the contenders in the North East. Look at all I have done. I have gone through the mills and the mix. I understand diversity. “And people from the other side of the country in the South trust me because of what I have been able to do, my achievements are tangible in the FCT and Bauchi and everywhere. So, nobody can come and tell me that I can take the second fiddle.”
