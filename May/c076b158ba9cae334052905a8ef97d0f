Ahead of the June 18, 2022, governorship election in Ekiti State, Yiaga Africa is set to deploy 500 polling unit observers under its “Watching The Vote” project in the state. The Programme Manager, Elections, of Yiaga, Mr Paul James, gave the figure at a workshop for Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and leaders in Ekiti State, saying they would be selected from the sampled 250 polling units in every LGA of the state. Mr James charged the CSOs to be more proactive than reactive since there was still a window before the governorship election, and called on the CSOs to engage the citizens and other stakeholders to ensure that the election was hitch-free. He said, “When the people sell their votes, they don’t have moral rights to question whoever emerged through that process. Instead of collecting those peanuts, they should rather ask the politicians to use the money for development purposes.” Meanwhile, a former Governor of Ekiti State and candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the state, Engr Segun Oni, has said only the SDP had answers to the challenges bedevilling the state. Oni urged the people of the state to come out en masse to vote for the SDP on June 18, 2022, in order to dethrone the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government in the state. The Director of Media and Publicity, Segun Oni Campaign Organisation, Mr Jackson Adebayo, in a statement yesterday, quoted the former governor as saying, “We observe that our people seem helpless in the hands of wicked pillagers who had successively taken the reigns of governance.”
