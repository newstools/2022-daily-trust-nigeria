Three Kano State House of Assembly members have dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP). The lawmakers announced their defection to NNPP yesterday in separate letters to the assembly. They are Abdullahi Iliyasu Yaryasa (Tudun Wada Constituency), Muhd Bello Butu Butu (Tofa/Rimin Gado Constituency) and Kabiru Yusuf Ismail (Madobi Constituency). Ten members of the house had, last week, decamped from PDP to NNPP. The NNPP is gaining ground in Kano since the state governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, endorsed his deputy to succeed him in 2023. A former governor of Kano state and national leader of NNPP, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso had said the doors of the party are open to everyone, including those at loggerheads with him.
