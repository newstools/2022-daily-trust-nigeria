The Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, yesterday, endorsed Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The emir, who spoke when he hosted members of the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 at his palace in Ilorin, said the APC leader “deserves to be the next Nigerian president”. The emir’s endorsement for Tinubu is coming at a time that an indigene of the state and former Senate President Bukola Saraki, who is a traditional title holder, is also running for the seat. According to the monarch, Tinubu has traversed the country and impacted many Nigerians positively. Sulu-Gambari then organised a special prayer for Tinubu and promised to continue to pray for his emergence both privately and publicly. In another meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the emir said his presidential ambition was based on his past record which has earned him respect all over the country. Osibanjo, in a remark, said he would hit the ground running and take the right decisions if elected president. He was in the state to address APC delegate ahead of May 30 Presidential primaries. Osinbajo said his experience as vice president in the last seven years has exposed him to series of security and economic challenges facing the country. The experience, he noted, placed him in the front burner against other aspirants vying for the seat.
