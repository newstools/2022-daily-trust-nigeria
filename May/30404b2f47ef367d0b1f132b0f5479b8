Son of the former Lagos State Governor and presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said leadership is defined by results. The politician’s son said this in a post on his verified Instagram account on Wednesday. He said he sat with his father and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, who both mentored him about leadership. He said, “Yesterday, I sat with Our Leader & our father, @officialasiwajubat together with Mr Governor and my Egbon @jidesanwoolu. During this meeting, I was repeatedly reminded by both mentors, that leadership is defined by results, not attributes or words alone. “It goes without saying that, their records speak to their results. God bless them. #incomingpresidentofnigeria by God’s Grace #BAT23 #2ndtermiscoming #Lagos. God bless Nigeria.” Seyi is the chairman of Loatsad Promomedia Limited, a digital and outdoor advertising company that provides services for various clients in Telecommunications, Energy, Banking, Food and Beverages, Pharmaceuticals, and the Lagos State Advertising Agency (LASAA), among others.
