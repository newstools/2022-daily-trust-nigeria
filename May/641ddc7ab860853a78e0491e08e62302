Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello has picked the All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the Niger North senatorial seat in the 2023 election. The governor will complete his second and final term in May 2023. He will battle for the party’s Niger North ticket with the senator currently representing the senatorial district, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, who has also picked the same forms. The forms were purchased by the Forum of Serving Commissioners for the governor. Bello had, in a letter, said his interest to contest for the Senate seat was a clarion call from his people whom he said saw him as a worthy ambassador to represent them. While receiving the nomination forms from his commissioners, Bello called for fairness and equity in the 2023 elections. Similarly, a Director of Statistics at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Mohammed Musa Tumala, has picked APC forms to run for senatorial election in Borno State. Tumala, in a chat with journalists shortly after collecting his forms, said that his return to politics was informed by the need “For professionals to get involved in reversing the increasingly worrisome socio-economic hardships of the people in communities in the state”.
