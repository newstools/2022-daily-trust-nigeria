A Nigerian firm, Temile Devt Co, has signed a contract with Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD) and Nigeria’s NNLG Shipping Management Ltd (NSML) to construct and supervise a 23,000 cubic metres Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) carrier vessel. The pact was signed at the World Gas Conference which was held in Daegu, South Korea this week. According to a statement from Temile yesterday, the new LPG carrier is expected for delivery on July 26, 2023 at HMD in Ulsan, Korea. Temile’s chief executive, Alfred Temile said: “We are delighted to execute the construction of our new LPG carrier with HMD. “Bringing onboard NSML to supervise the construction, as an indigenous company demonstrates our commitment and support to the Nigeria Local Content Act and as well establishes our confidence in local capacity to deliver international acceptable standards.” He was hopeful that Hyundai will construct an eco-design/cleaner fuel vessel in line with international best practices and industrial regulations thereby creating a space for the vessel in the international gas supply value chain. “Having taken delivery of our first LPG carrier vessel which is currently chartered to Nigeria LNG Limited for domestic LPG supply, we look forward to taking delivery of this new carrier in July 2023 to make an addition to the global gas supply industry,” Engr Temile said.
