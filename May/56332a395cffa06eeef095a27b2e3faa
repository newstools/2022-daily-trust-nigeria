Ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary, which begins on Sunday, its National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said the consensus method which was used in electing party officers during the March 26, 2022 convention may not be feasible. In an interview with the Voice of America (VOA) Hausa service in Abuja on Wednesday, the APC chairman said a presidential primary was completely different from a chairmanship election.

You can’t even compare the two of them. That question does not arise. “However the party has laid down its rules and regulations for the aspirants. We would scrutinise all of them based on our guidelines to be sure we pick the right candidate for the party,” Adamu said. He also stated that the 28 aspirants ought to know that all of them cannot emerge as the candidate of the party. “You can’t stop a party stalwart from contesting elections or aspiring for the presidency. It is their right and we are happy for them. There is nothing wrong with anybody aspiring for the exalted seat of the presidency. It is God that decides who gets what. “Once God makes up his mind and says this is who He wants, that is what we are praying for. We have 28 aspirants for the presidential ticket and everybody knows that all of them cannot get the ticket. “If it is God’s wish, they all can even be president of the country one after the other. Ours is to ensure justice in the choice of who emerges as the candidate of the party. That does not mean we are perfect. But we pray we do the right thing,” the APC chairman said.
