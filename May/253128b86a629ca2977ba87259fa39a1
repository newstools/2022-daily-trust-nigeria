 A presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party, Muhammed Hayatu-Deen, has blamed the absence of proper checks and balances by those saddled with the responsibility of governance as the reason for the current woes in the country. Speaking during a consultation meeting with PDP House of Representatives members, Hayatu-Deen also lamented the state of insecurity in the country, adding that nobody with conscience will allow the spilling of blood like it is happening in the country. He promised to deliver good governance by tackling the security challenges bedeviling the nation and making life better for the citizenry. “We also want to stop the ocean of blood in this country. It is mind-boggling and it’s almost unbelievable. Nobody with conscience will see our sons and daughters, grandchildren, mothers, sisters, aunts and uncles being slaughtered all over the place,” he said. Similarly, Chairman and General Leader of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Surulere District, Senior Special Apostle Sunday F. Korede, has said leadership defect is a contributing factor to the myriad of challenges facing the country. He stated this while addressing newsmen in Lagos ahead of a Symposium on ‘The state, the society and the church’ adding that the ideal leadership must have certain attributes conducive for peace and growth. “It is just the old that keep transferring power from one president to the other. The youths are not allowed. Government needs to be advised on why youths should be part of the nation’s politics,” he said.
