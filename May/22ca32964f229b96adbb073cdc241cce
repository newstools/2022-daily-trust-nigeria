A governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC in Oyo State, Senator Teslim Folarin, has vowed that he will not withdraw from the race for others. Sen Folarin, who represents Oyo Central, yesterday dismissed claims that he had been asked to step down for Chief Adebayo Adelabu, APC’s governorship candidate in 2019.

The lawmaker further said he was convinced that he would clinch the party’s governorship ticket. He said, “The news is a sponsored fake news aimed at misleading the people of Oyo State, teeming members of our great party, APC, and my teeming supporters across the length and breadth of our state. “I want to disclaim that there was no instruction handed down to me by any person, group of persons or the highest hierarchy of our great party. “I am actively in the race and will undoubtedly get the majority votes of our party delegates on Thursday, May 26, 2022, to become the 2023 Oyo APC governorship flag bearer.”
