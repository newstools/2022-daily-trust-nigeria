The House of Representatives yesterday amended Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act 2022 to enable statutory delegates to participate in political parties’ congresses and conventions. The amendment followed the consideration and passage of a bill sponsored by the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, during plenary. The Senate had, on Tuesday, amended the same section of the Act. Doguwa said the amendment will allow statutory delegates, in addition to the delegates elected by various political parties, to vote during congresses and conventions to elect candidates for various political offices. Speaking after passing the bill, Deputy Speaker Idris Wase, who presided over the plenary, thanked the lawmakers for responding to the emergency plenary session to pass the legislation. Meanwhile, the two chambers of the National Assembly have adjourned sittings to enable lawmakers to participate fully in the presidential, National Assembly, governorship, and state houses of assembly primaries. While the Senate adjourned plenary to June 7, 2022, House of Representatives adjourned until May 24. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given political parties a deadline of June 3, 2022, to present their candidates. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks moments before the close of plenary yesterday said: “Processing of forms for House of Representatives and Senate has started and we are expected to submit our completed forms tomorrow (Friday). “And, of course, we have some of our colleagues here who are going for governorship seats of their states. “It is very important that we participate in the process that affects us directly, as well as those processes that do not affect us directly – that is the state houses of assembly, governorship and presidential.” By Abdullateef Salau & Itodo D.
