A presidential aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and a former Vice-President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has expressed his readiness to restructure Nigeria in order to boost the national economy and security if elected president. Atiku made this known during a meeting with PDP delegates on Sunday in Abia. He said that he would transform the country if given the opportunity. Atiku said there was the need for the party to emerge victorious during the 2023 general election for the aspirations of the people to be realised. Many Nigerians have been clamouring for the restructuring of the country but successive governments have been paying lip service to this demand. However, Atiku said that his manifesto is focused on five key areas namely; national unity, economic development, national security, education and restructuring of the nation. “Together we can achieve all these goals if we unite as a party,” he said. Also, the Abia State Chairman of the PDP, Chief Asiforo Okere, said the contributions of the presidential aspirant to the party would never be unappreciated. He prayed to God to grant Atiku’s desire of becoming the next president of Nigeria. (NAN)
