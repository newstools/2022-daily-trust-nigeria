The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) has said it will clamp down on individuals and organisations engaged in advertising without licence. According to the law of the council, it is illegal and criminal for anyone to practice advertising without being first registered by APCON. Addressing newsmen on the need to ensure compliance of online advertisement with the provisions of the Nigerian Code of Advertising Practice, sales promotions and other rights/restrictions on practice, the registrar/chief executive of the council, Dr. Olalekan Fadolapo, noted that APCON has since its establishment by Act No. 55 of 1988 been charged with the regulation and control of advertising in Nigeria in all aspects and ramifications. Fadolapo affirmed that the advent of the internet and new media, characterized by social networking sites, has revolutionized communication globally.
