President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Dr (Mrs) Jummai Adamu Tutuwa as the substantive Director-General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIIRO) Lagos, with effect from 10th May 2022. Tutuwa’s appointment on Thursday came three years after a succession tussle rocked the institute following the expiration of then DG, Prof Gloria Elemo’s tenure in 2019. A Director in the institute, Chima Igwe, was appointed by the then Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, as the acting DG against the advice of the FIIRO’s Governing Board. Igwe was later found out by the ICPC to have a fake Doctor of Philosophy certificate. Tutuwa has taken over from Dr. (Mrs) Agnes E. Asagbra, who was saddled with the management of FIIRO from February 2020 till date, a statement by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation’s Deputy Director in charge of Press and Public Relations, Atuora Obed said on Thursday. Prior to her appointment,  Tutuwa was the Director in charge of the Biotechnology  Centre at the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) Jalingo, Taraba State.
