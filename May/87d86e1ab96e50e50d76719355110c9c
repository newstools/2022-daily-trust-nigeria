The President of the African Development Bank Group, Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, has promised that the bank will continue to make Africa proud by supporting the implementation of impactful and life-transforming projects across the continent. Adesina disclosed this via a tweet through his verified Tweeter handle @akin_adesina. He said: “This day in 2015, I was first elected President of the African Development Bank. Six years later, the African Development Bank was named the Best Multilateral Financial Institution in the world, and 4th most transparent institution in the world. We will keep making Africa proud.” In 2021, the US-based magazine, Global Finance, specializing in financial markets and investment banking, named the African Development Bank as the “Best Multilateral Financial Institution in the world for 2021”. The award is a global recognition for the path-breaking efforts of the AfDB as it transforms itself into a solutions bank for Africa, through a combination of its operations, knowledge services and investment positioning, which continue to help accelerate Africa’s development. “With widespread expectations of consolidation in multiple sectors and all around the world, investment banks will play a leading role in reshaping the world economy post-pandemic,” said Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance in announcing the winning list. “Companies need more than ever to understand the specialities and skills that investment banks bring to the table. Global Finance awards are a valuable guide,” he said. In 2020 the AfDB received broad recognition for responding swiftly to the needs of the African continent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and for its pioneering role in the global social bond market. In October 2020, AfDB was selected in a poll of global bond market players as the best issuer for its $3 billion dollar-denominated Fight COVID-19 social bond, issued on 27 March 2020.
