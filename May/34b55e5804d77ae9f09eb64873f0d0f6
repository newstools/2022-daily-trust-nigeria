The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday said it will suspend the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise on June 30, 2022. It explained that the suspension was to enable the commission clean up the registration data ahead of the 2023 polls. INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this at the second quarterly consultative meeting with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. He said, “As you are aware, the ongoing CVR exercise ends next month, that is 30th June, 2022. Both the online pre-registration, as well as the physical registration, at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. “However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centres. For this reason, the commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks, that is 30th May, 2022. “This will enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June, 2022. “This will enable the commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) and compile the register ahead of the 2023 general elections.” On the inclusivity of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the electoral process, the INEC boss said that Section 54(2) of the Electoral Act made provision for assistive materials for them. The Country Director of Action Aid Nigeria (AAN) and convener of the Civil Society Situation Room, Ms Ene Obi, who spoke on behalf of the CSOs, urged INEC to stick to its timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections.
