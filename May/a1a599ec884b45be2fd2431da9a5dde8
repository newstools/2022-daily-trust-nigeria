The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) is set to hold a national dialogue to discuss challenges facing Nigeria’s economy as well as find long-term solutions. According to the group, the dialogue is necessary as a wide array of socio-economic challenges that beset the Nigerian economy has clearly shown that the country cannot rely on the business-as-usual practice and must instead embrace a more holistic approach to finding lasting solutions to the nation’s array of problems. A statement released by the Group in Abuja yesterday noted that an urgent turnaround in policy choices and economic management is required to achieve improved socio-economic outcomes, which is why there is no better time than now for the country to make good choices that will proffer short and long-term solutions to the current economic situation. Part of the statement reads: “Nigeria’s critical challenges have persevered over the years with no solid political will to address them by successive administrations. Insecurity in various forms – kidnapping, banditry and manslaughter – is the order of the day in Nigeria, with negative implications for socio-economic outcomes. In light of this, there is an urgent need to have a National Economic Dialogue on how best to tackle the social menace.
