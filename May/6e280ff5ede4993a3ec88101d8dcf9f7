A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senator, Abiodun Olujimi, has said former President Goodluck Jonathan will not contest the 2023 elections on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Abiodun made the observation during an interview with TVC at the venue of the ongoing primaries of the opposition party. Jonathan, who served as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice-President and President under the PDP, is missing at the primaries of the opposition party. Jonathan has been linked to the APC presidential race as the N100 million forms were purchased on his behalf. On Friday, a Federal High Court in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, cleared the former president for the 2023 presidential contest.
