The managing director and chief executive officer of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Engineer Suleiman Abdulaziz, has said the 330 Kudendan to Mando transmission line project is at 80 per cent completion. The MD, while speaking at an inspection tour of the project in Kudendan and Mando in Kaduna, assured that they would meet the completion deadline of December 2022. Daily Trust reports that the project, which was awarded to Atlantic Engineering Company in 2018, is expected to improve power stability in Kaduna and its environs. Already, the contractor has successfully erected 38 towers out of 55. According to the MD, “The Kudendan power station is generating 215 megawatts and we have to evacuate this power to Mando 330 sub-station in Kaduna. We are now building a 330 transmission line from Kudendan to Mando. “In addition to that, we have the Gurara generation station which is generating 30 megawatts; that project has been completed a long time ago and the minister of Water Resources is always writing to the minister of Power to make sure that we finish our project so that the 30 megawatts can be evacuated.” Highlighting some reasons hindering the speedy completion of the project, the managing director said compensation is a major challenge. He assured that talks are on with the Kaduna State government to find a solution to that saying, “Near the 330 substation in Mando, there is also land there and the owner is asking for compensation and according to TCN rules and regulations, we only pay for crops and property, we do not pay for land because the land belongs to the government.” He then noted that TCN is also talking with the state government to find a way of resolving the issue.
