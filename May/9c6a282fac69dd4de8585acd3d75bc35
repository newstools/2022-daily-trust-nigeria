Living Faith Church, Kaduna, has distributed items to civilian victims of banditry admitted at the Saint Gerard’s Hospital, Kaduna, and wounded soldiers at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital Kaduna. The Resident Pastor of the church, Agi Emmanuel, said the gesture was done to commiserate with the civilian and military victims of banditry. He said Kaduna was chosen for the gesture in particular as part of events to commemorate the church’s 41st anniversary of the liberation mandate of Bishop David Oyedepo on May 2, 1981, held in the state. According to him, following the security challenges in the state the church initiated a programme, Kaduna Prays, through which each ethnic group in Nigeria was invited and called in each service to pray.
