Governors Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have sought the support of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegates in Gombe State towards their presidential ambition. Speaking with newsmen after meeting the delegates at the PDP secretariat in Gombe, Governor Tambuwal blamed the federal government for the persisting security challenge, saying the current system rendered the state governments powerless in addressing the menace. Tambuwal pledged to unite the country and ensure that security issues were taken seriously and the process of responding to threats improved. Governor Bala Mohammed on his part said the country was at a point where only restructuring and devolution of powers would guarantee peace, unity and development. He said, “If given the chance, I will unify the country, all these aspirations for self-actualisation, I will respect them, but I will make them see the futility of breakage.” He pledged to empower the various agitators to contribute to the development of the country rather than breaking away.
