The Coalition of Closed Unpaid Textiles Workers Association, Kaduna State, has cried out over the non-payment of their entitlements 20 years after the closure of many textile companies in the state. Staging a peaceful protest at the Kaduna Textile Limited (KTL) yesterday, the workers called on the federal and Kaduna State governments to urgently come to their rescue by settling their unpaid entitlements to enable them to secure a better life for their children. Chairman of the group, Comrade Jeibe Wordam Simdik, explained that the textiles industry in Kaduna and some parts of the country fully contributed to the economic growth of the nation. “Unfortunately, since the closure of these textile mills, they have faced many ugly challenges which include non-medical health, their children’s education, broken marriages, and their wives and children becoming street hawkers and beggars to feed.” “Reopening all closed textiles in Nigeria which include Kaduna Textiles Limited, Arewa Textiles PLC, NORTEX Nigeria Limited, and FINETEX Limited, will create job opportunities for the teeming youth and check insecurity in Nigeria. “Our present leaders who have led us for more than 20 years, what legacy have they left for our children, for refusing to pay our entitlements after putting in several years of service,” he lamented. He then called on the owners of all closed textile companies to pay textile workers their entitlements which are long overdue.
