Some less-privileged women have gotten grants and non-interest loans to help them start and expand their businesses from an NGO, Children and Adult Empowerment Initiative (CAADEI), in Kubwa, Abuja. During the disbursement ceremony on Saturday, one of the beneficiaries, Rita Nuhu, who got a N100,000 loan, said the money would help her expand her business. She said, “I sell foodstuff like beans, rice, corn and yam. With this money I received today, I will buy these foodstuff in bulk and make better profits. I am grateful to CAADEI.” Another beneficiary, Ibekwe Gracious Kelechi, who got a N50,000 grant, said the money would help her start a food packaging business. She said, “I want to start processing plantain and millet for sale. This money will help me buy what I need to do the business.” The Executive Director of CAADEI, Mrs Stella Ebele Okafor, said 15 women had so far benefitted from the initiative this year. She said, “An orphaned family and two visually impaired widows got N50,000 each as grant. For the first time, the organisation has upgraded two of its non-interest loans and given 100,000 to two women and 10 women got N50,000 each.”
