There was a protest yesterday at the Ogun State secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abeokuta over imposition of delegates. Aggrieved members of the party in Abeokuta South Local Government Area stormed the secretariat to protest the removal of their names from the delegates list ahead of the party’s primary elections. The party members, drawn from wards 5, 8 and 15 in Abeokuta South, lamented that they were sidelined in the list of delegates by party executives led by the Abeokuta South Chairman, Henry Fagbenro. The plot, according to them, is to give some aspirants soft landing in the primaries. Speaking on behalf of the aggrieved members, Hon Sharafadeen Ogunwolu called for the intervention of the state executives of the APC. However, Fagbenro denied substituting members’ names on the list of delegates, saying the allegation lacked merit. He explained that Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, had, through the state’s party Chairman, Yemi Sanusi, directed that the leaders of the 15 wards should be allowed to select five delegates from each ward for onward submission to the party secretariat. He said, “If these people want to fight, then they should face their ward leaders who nominated five names of members to make the delegates list.”
