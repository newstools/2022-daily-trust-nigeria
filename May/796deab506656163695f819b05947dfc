Ekiti State governor and chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi, yesterday said he was confident of emerging as the AllProgressives Congress (APC) presidential flag bearer ahead of the 2023 general election. Fayemi spoke while briefing newsmen shortly after meeting with party delegates in Maiduguri, Borno State. He said there were competent Nigerians in all parts of the country but insisted that his role as a foundation member of the APC coupled with his former position as the pioneer chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum gave him an edge over other presidential aspirants of the party. On the agitation by some APC leaders to zone the presidency to South, Fayemi said competence must not be sacrificed on the altar of zoning, adding that every part of the country should have a sense of belonging in governance
