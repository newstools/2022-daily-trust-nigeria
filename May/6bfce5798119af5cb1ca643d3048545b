Traders, especially broom sellers, in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, say they are making huge sales in the wake of a visit by President Muhammadu Buhari to the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that President Buhari has scheduled a two-day working visit to inaugurate projects executed by Gov David Umahi. The presidential visit is for Thursday and Friday, May 5 and 6. Some of the projects for inauguration are the Ecumenical Centre, Sparido Tunnel, a shopping mall and an international market. NAN’s visit to some markets and streets in the state revealed that there were price hikes on brooms and food items. Some of the traders who spoke with NAN on Thursday said the visit was a welcome development to the state and their businesses. Mrs Joy Onu, a trader at the international market, Abakaliki, told NAN that brooms were sold at between N300 and N500 per one as against N150 and N200. She said, “We are happy over the visit and the way our businesses are lifted. The presidential visit, and APC in particular as a party, has brought a turnaround to broom business. “I had to go to distant villages to purchase the brooms, and after expenses, including transportation, we are making gains.’’ Another broom seller at the Kpirikpiri Market, Mrs Mercy Chukwu, said she was having good patronage, and also commended the presidential visit. She said, “The price is good, comparing the present economy. We sell from N300 up. The visit is a big one to the state, and this is an opportunity for us.’’ Mrs Mariah Onwe, a food vendor, also hailed the presidential visit, adding that she was having good sales. Mr Peter Okafor, an APC chieftain, said the importance of broom as the symbol of their party could not be overemphasised. She said, “This is what we are going to use to sweep in good economy for the people.” (NAN)
