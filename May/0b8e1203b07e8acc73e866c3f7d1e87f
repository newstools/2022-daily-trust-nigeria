No fewer than 300 orphans and vulnerable children from Gama in Nassarawa LGA of Kano State and its neighbouring communities have benefited from clothes and other materials donated by Gama Orphans and Vulnerable Children’s Committee. The community self-help group was established under the domain of Alhaji Rabiu Muhammmad Isyaku, Village Head of Gama. Speaking to journalists during the distribution exercise, the Chairman of the committee, Alhaji Ado Muhammmad Gama, a ward head in Gama, said the committee also donated food items to 75 caregivers of the orphans. He pointed out that the aim of the exercise was to seek Allah’s blessings during and after the month of Ramadan. According to Ado Gama, this year’s event was the ninth in a series, noting that the committee within the last year attained successful stories which included paying SSCE registration fees for two female orphans who at the end obtained nine credits each. He called on philanthropists living in Gama and its neighbouring communities to collaborate with Gama Orphans and Vulnerable Committee for alms giving to have Allah’s blessings.
