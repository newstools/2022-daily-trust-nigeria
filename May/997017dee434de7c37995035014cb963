A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aspirant for Kaduna North Federal Constituency seat, Shehu Usman ABG, has reneged on his promise to delegates after he failed to clinch the party’s ticket. ABG had pledged to give N2.5m cash to each of the 37 delegates who participated in the primary, amounting to N92.5m. At the end of the voting on Sunday evening in Kaduna, Samaila Suleiman who currently occupies the seat won with 20 votes, while Shehu Usman ABG polled 14 votes and Adam Namadi, son of a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo, got two votes. Following the primary, our correspondent gathered from delegates that ABG failed to fulfil his pledge after losing the contest and went home with his cash. Similarly, Adam Namadi, who gave out N2m to each of the delegates during the primary, has asked for refund. It was gathered that Samaila Suleiman, who recently decamped from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP, distributed between N3.5m to N4m to each delegate.
