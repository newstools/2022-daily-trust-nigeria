 The National Bureau (NBS) of Statistics has concluded plans to conduct surveys in the agriculture value chain to garner information useful to attract investors into the country. The Chairman, Governing Board of NBS, Dr Kabiru Nakaura, during a sensitisation workshop for the National Agricultural Sample Census (NASC), stated that the lack of information on agricultural produce and their yields has deprived Nigeria of evidence to convince investors to invest in the agric sector. “The last census was conducted in 1994, so, for example, it is impossible to tell a foreign investor the ton of rice to be gotten from an acre of land and the number of persons to be employed on it. Without this information, they won’t be able to take the risk in the sector.” Nakaura added that the census would touch on what part of the country a particular produce is sourced from, manpower needed in planting and harvesting as well as products that are yet to be harvested.
