The presidential campaign organization of Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has charged delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to consider the voting strength of the North West zone while making their decision. The campaign organization said as a party that has lost two consecutive presidential elections and wants to win in 2023, a candidate from the North West zone will make the task easier. Addressing a press conference in Abuja ahead of the primaries slated for 28-29 of this month, Prince Daniel spokesman of the campaign, said all the aspirants were from different regions of the country but the North West has the strength to deliver the party. He also said Governor Tambuwal during his tour of states has convinced the delegates that he is the candidate that the country needs at this point in time, saying the aspirants are from different regions, “but you cannot take away the voting strength of the North West.” Daniel said: “The campaign is making a passionate appeal to party faithful and delegates nationwide to take advantage of this opportunity to right all the wrongs and vote with conscience as we cannot afford to get it wrong again this time. “The choice you make at the primaries will determine if the ship successfully sails to shore or sinks in the deep seas. “Nigeria’s fate is pinned on you to present a credible and detribalized candidate. We are counting on your patriotism to vote right and ensure your votes count. “With our aggravated challenges, bringing our country back from the brink is an economic, moral, political and social imperative. Nigeria is at a crossroad and needs to take effective decisions on its next political and governance steps and we believe that Tambuwal is capable to deliver,” he said.
