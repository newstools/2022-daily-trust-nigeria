Two suspected armed robbers have been burnt to death in Kanshio, a suburb of Makurdi in Benue State. Residents told our correspondent that the duo were pursued in the early hours of Monday and caught opposite Divine Mercy Minor Seminary school at Kanshio where they were eventually set ablaze. It was gathered that the suspects, who were initially three but one of them escaped during the pursuit, had forcefully gained entrance into a residence in Kanshio in an attempt to rob a family after shooting sporadically to wade off intervention.

A resident explained that the suspects, after rescuing their member, retreated by climbing through the fence and fleeing on a waiting motorcycle at the roadside but their victims raised an alarm which attracted some vigilant youths in the area. The youths, as further learnt, chased the suspects to the point where two of them were trapped in the vicinity opposite the seminary and immediately set ablaze while the remaining one jumped through the seminary fence and escaped. Police Public Relations Officer PPRO for Benue Command, SP Catherine Anene, confirmed the incident. “Incidents confirmed. Investigation is ongoing, please,” Anene stated in a text message.
