The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has fixed May 28 to 30, 2022, for its national convention. The party’s acting National Chairman, Chief Supo Shonibare, disclosed this in Abuja yesterday during a press briefing. He said the ward and local government congresses of the party would hold on May 19, while the state congresses would hold May 20. On the party’s leadership crisis, Shonibare said there was conspiracy by “usurpers” who joined the party in 2018 in cohort with some elements at INEC to render the party ineffective through factionalisation.
