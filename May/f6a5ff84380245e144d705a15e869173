A former Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Isaac Eke (Rtd.), yesterday urged politicians to join forces with the security agents and other well-meaning Nigerians to solve the country’s security problem. Eke spoke in Abuja while responding to Daily Trust’s enquiry at a media chat organised by New Nigeria Dream Initiative (NNDI) the remarks by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor that, “Without security, elections in the country won’t be possible.” Eke said: “I’m in line with what the Chief of Defence Staff said that election in 2023 would be a mirage if our environment is not secure and safe because we are in a situation whereby we have to parley with each other. “We need to be pragmatic, and whatever we are doing in terms of security, we don’t disclose everything because if you strategise and you disclose it, the results will be nothing. The terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, among others will use that against you.”
