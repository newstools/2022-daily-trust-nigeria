Stakeholders under the aegis of Concerned Nigerian Citizens (CNC) yesterday said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)’s indecision on zoning ahead of the 2023 general elections is threatening the unity of the country. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, the convener of CNC, Femi Osabinu, also called on the political gladiators across ethnic nationalities to stop dividing Nigerians via exchange of words on power rotation. He said, “We have also noticed how unstable and highly political most of our political parties are responding to the call for power rotation. This has made us to come together to lend our voice to the voice of reasoning, voice of a unified and greater Nigeria by urging all concerned political parties to zone the presidency to the South. “Since the return to civil rule in 1999, there has been an unwritten conventional way for power rotation between the North and the South. “It baffles us that as the debate intensifies and parties’ national conventions draw nearer, most political parties are planning to play down the zoning arrangement with selfish excuses of population spread across the country.”
