Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said he is the most experienced and prepared to lead Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari. Osinbajo stated this yesterday at the palace of the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adejugbe, in Ekiti State. The VP was in the state in continuation of his consultation with stakeholders and All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates across the country ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Osinbajo said working with President Buhari, who he described as transparent and honest leader, had prepared him for the bigger task of leading the nation in 2023. He said, “I have worked under a very open and transparent president who has given me every opportunity to understand some of the issues and challenges that affect a country of a size and diversity like Nigeria. “So, I have all these opportunities, and I must say that having had those opportunities, when the time for people to put themselves forward to run as president comes, I believe it will be irresponsible of me after seven years not to join the race.” Responding, Oba Adejugbe commended the vice president for his contributions to the development of the country. He, however, said the country’s next president “should remember the traditional institution for critical roles in nation building rather than advisory or visitations during election period.”
