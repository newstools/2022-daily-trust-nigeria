Senator Ibrahim Shekarau has picked the membership card of the fast growing New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP). The senator, who was elected to the upper chamber of the National Assembly on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) dumped the party following deep crisis. His decamping was witnessed by many of his supporters at the Mundubawa residence of Shekarau. Former Kano state governor and leader of the NNPP, Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, who was in attendance at the official defection handed over Shekarau’s NNPP membership card to him. In attendance were political stakeholders and supporters in the kwankwasiyya camp, leadership of the Shura council in the house of Shekarau and other well wishers.
