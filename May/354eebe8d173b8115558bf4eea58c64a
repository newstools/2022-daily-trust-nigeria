 A former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has said his performance as governor of Edo State will give him victory in the 2023 senatorial poll in the state. The former Edo State governor stated this at the weekend while speaking with newsmen shortly after winning the ticket for the Edo North senatorial district on the platform of APC. “The people of Edo North, beyond the members of the APC and even members of the PDP who had benefited from my stewardship as governor of Edo state, would give me their votes. “At the National Assembly, I will do more because I am more exposed now, having been governor for two terms and chairman of APC for two years. Life is full of ups and downs and has valleys and hills, but rugged men are the ones who are able to navigate the hills and valleys to get to their destinations,” he said.
