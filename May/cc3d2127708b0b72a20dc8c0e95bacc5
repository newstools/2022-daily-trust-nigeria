Barring any last-minute change, 811 delegates will elect the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate at its national convention slated for May 28 and 29. The elected delegates of the party, Daily Trust gathered, consist of one national delegate from each of the 774 local government areas and one special delegate per state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from among persons living with disabilities. The PDP had said that only elected delegates would participate in the nomination of the party’s candidates for all elective positions at the general elections in line with the Electoral Act, 2022. The National Assembly had altered Section 84 (8) of the act to include statutory delegates among the participants at congresses and conventions of political parties, but President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to assent to the legislation. The PDP had cleared former vice president, Atiku Abubakar; former Senate Presidents, Bukola Saraki and Pius Anyim; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Bauchi and Sokoto State Governors, Bala Mohammed and Aminu Tambuwal to contest the party’s presidential ticket. Others were River State Governor, Nyesom Wike; former banker, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; pharmacist, Sam Ohabunwa, Akwa Ibom State Governor, Emmanuel Udom, among others.
