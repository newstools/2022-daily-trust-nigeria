The Director-General of the Tinubu Support Group, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has failed to disclose his new party after dumping the All Progressives Congress (APC). The former federal lawmaker announced his departure from the APC last Saturday, saying he would unveil his next party within 24 hours. “I have done my best for APC. It’s time to move on. I will announce my new political party within the next 24 hours Insha Allah. I will make a formal statement in due course,” he had tweeted. There are reports that Jibrin, who represented Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State in the House of Representatives, decided to leave the ruling party after falling out with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Some blogs later reported that Tinubu had reconciled Jibrin and Ganduje. However, more than 48 hours after he promised to update Nigerians on his next political move, Jibrin has not done so.
