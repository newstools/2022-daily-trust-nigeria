 Dangote Cement is set to empower stakeholders in the value chain of Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) supply as part of its strategies to shore up and sustain its availability as a waste that is co-processed in the cement kiln in order to recover energy. This, the cement manufacturer, said was part of its contribution to the global environmental preservation efforts and circular economy. A team from Dangote Cement led by the Head, Alternative Fuel Project, Engr Peter Anagbe and the Head, Sustainability, Igazeuma Okoroba, recently visited one of the farm settlements in Ikire, in Irewole LGA of Osun State where PKS are sourced to ascertain the needs of the community and ways through which the company can empower them. Engr Anagbe told the community that Dangote Cement was desirous of ensuring sustainable collection of waste materials in the form of PKS, as a means of improving the environment and an addition to the source of livelihood for them. He urged the people to always look at alternative values. A community leader, Elder Hammed Adekunle, said the use of PKS for co-processing offered them an opportunity to expand and diversify. The team later headed to Ibese cement plant on a tour of the Alternative Fuel Pneumatic Feeding System and the PKS storage area. Acting Ibese Plant Director, Mr Myneni Nageswara, lauded efforts of the company in providing alternative fuel sources to traditional fossil fuel, thereby mitigating the impact of emission and conserving energy.
