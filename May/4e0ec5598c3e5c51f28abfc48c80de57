 Helicopter operators in Nigeria will from May 9, 2022 be required to pay higher landing charges. The management of Naebi Dynamic Concepts Limited, the concessionaire of the service, announced this in a statement. It is not immediately clear how much the new landing charges would be as the concessionaire declined to provide specifics on the charges. However, stakeholders and Helicopter Services Operators in Nigeria, had in February 2022 at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, engaged with the management of Naebi Dynamic Concepts Limited, the concessionaire empowered by the Federal Government of Nigeria, to collect helicopter landing charges as well as monitoring and surveillance of helicopter movements in Nigeria. The Managing Director/CEO, Naed Dynamic Concepts Limited, Mr Stanley Chike, said the stakeholders and helicopter operators were briefed on the concessionaire’s mandate and informed of the statutory landing fees to be charged. He said the collection of helicopter landing charges will begin on May 9, 2022. He explained that the helicopter services are adding to the existing charge and collection is starting nationwide simultaneously. He noted that 90 days’ notice was given after inauguration by the representative of the SGF and minister of aviation on February 4, 2022 and collection starts by May 2022. He also said when the concession commences, they will monitor all helicopter movements in Nigeria. “We are building a state of the art control room to monitor all helicopter movements and give this information to the government promptly. Gone are the days when unauthorised and illegal movements of helicopters will go unnoticed” he said.
