An upper Shari’a High Court sitting at Kofar Kudu presided over by Justice Ibrahim Sarki Yola has adjourned the hearing of the case of Abduljabbar Kabara over the absence of the case’s presiding judge who is faced with health challenges. Spokesman to Shari’a courts, Muzammil Ado Fagge made this known to journalists on Thursday. This is the first time the court has not sat since the arraignment of the suspect on July 16, 2021, after he was accused of blasphemous statements against the Prophet Muhammad PBUH; an action capable of inciting public peace. According to Ado, the case has been adjourned to June 2, 2022. Recall that in the previous court session, the court ordered the provision of legal representation for Abduljabbar from the legal aid council over the absence of lawyers who will stand for him being the third time counsel to Abduljabbar has quit in the case.
