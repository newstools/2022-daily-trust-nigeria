One of Nigeria’s leading telecom executives, Lanre Olaniyan, has stepped down from his position as the Managing Director of Omnicom Solutions Limited after 14 years. In a statement, Olaniyan explained that contrary to expectation, he did not quit the company but stepped aside to focus on other interests. “I’m still part of the Omnicom team, and I only stepped aside as the MD. Knowing that I have given my best to Omnicom, I believe the stage is set for someone new to run the company and take it to greater heights while I sit on the board and give advisory support,” he said. He further revealed that his decision to step aside had been reached for a while due to several reasons but was only made official in March 2022. Olaniyan led Omnicom Solutions from its startup years into a multibillion-naira company with several projects in Nigeria and across the West African subregion, as revealed during its 10th anniversary in 2018. On his next move, he said: “I am involved in many projects and other ventures, and some of those ventures need attention. They need nurturing, just as I did for Omnicom. So, those are what I will be dedicating my time to, moving on.”
