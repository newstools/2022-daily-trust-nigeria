The Ogun State Chief Judge, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, has freed 31 inmates from correctional service centres across the state. Speaking at the ceremonial hall of the judiciary complex in Abeokuta during the release of the prisoners, Justice Dipeolu said eight of them were pardoned from Oba, six from Ibara-Abeokuta, six from Ijebu-Ode, eight from Ilaro and three from Sagamu correctional centres. The CJ said those granted amnesty had been in custody for a certain number of years, some due to poor health, while others because their case files could not be located. He advised them not to go back to their old ways but engage in tangible professions. Justice Dipeolu said, “Usually, there is an administration of criminal justice committee which looks through the lists of inmates and recommends those that are worthy of release after lots of investigations.” She further said new modalities had been initiated where pictures with full details of inmates would be taken for record purposes, pointing out that if such inmates committed other offenses after being discharged, the records would be located and the culprits would be dealt with according to the provisions of the law. In his contribution, the Controller of Correctional Centres, Ogun State Command, Mr AbdulRasheed Alimi, appreciated the CJ for setting up the administration of criminal justice committee, noting that the discharge of inmates on a quarterly basis had assisted in the decongestion of correctional centres, as well as the reformation of some of the inmates. Speaking on behalf of a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Friends of Joseph Foundation (FOJOF), its Head of Advocacy, Mr Taiwo Olukoyede, said some inmates pardoned in the past had been rehabilitated and were doing great.
