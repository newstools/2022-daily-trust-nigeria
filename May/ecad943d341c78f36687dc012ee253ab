Meanwhile, NBS and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are set to conduct a national household survey on income and expenditure to aid government formulation and policies. Speaking yesterday at a press briefing in Abuja, the Statistician-General of the Federation/CEO (NBS), Mr. Semiu Adeyemi Adeniran, said data from the survey would help to track the success, or otherwise, of several policies and interventions put in place in recent years by government in response to the macro and socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19. On his part, the CBN governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, said the survey is to enable the government to have credible data and information that will aid policy articulation in the economy as a whole. Represented by the deputy director, Monetary and Financial Statistics, Bello Yakubu, Emefiele noted that the survey would generate information on households, their pattern of consumption, income generation, house affordability and their residency and would be in line with international standards.
