The economy of Benue State can be unlocked with mechanised agriculture and the development of an agricultural value chain. Also, there are huge raw materials in the state that need to be converted to finished products like silicon which can be converted to bullet proof glass to help the state industrialise. Engr Titus Ubah, the consensus governorship aspirant of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), stated this in a chat with our correspondent in Abuja. He said Benue State is blessed with fertile land for agriculture and if properly harnessed, the state can be one of the richest states in Nigeria. He said if given the opportunity to govern the state, his focus will be agriculture development first, then leverage the revenue from there to transform other sectors like industrialisation, rural access roads, education and healthcare delivery. Engr Ubah who is also the current Speaker, Benue State Assembly, also said it’s not all about fancy blueprints which everyone can produce but the commitment to developing the state one sector at a time. Speaking about the glass potential of Benue, he said: “So, let me tell you something about the sand we have in Benue State. There has been research on that. Benue has what it’s called Silicon, which is used in producing glasses. The quality you have here is the one that is used to produce bullet proof glasses. When I met with the Chinese, they said Benue is sitting on billions of dollars. Today, if you dredge that River, you will have a company that will be extracting Silicon and even exporting it.”
