 Some stakeholders of the Ebonyi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have asked the Senator Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to quickly resolve the crisis in the state or the party would lose 2023 polls in the state. A statement yesterday by chairman of a group called the APC Mainstream Chapter, Alhaji Haroun O.Ajah, said the national leadership of the party should rescue the party from imminent collapse in the state. “The Ebonyi APC crisis is deepening and the mainstream APC stakeholders are set to save our great party, APC, from imminent collapse due to the faulty processes in the selection of candidates for the 2023 general elections. “This is a reinvigoration and reactivation of our struggles for legitimate APC leadership in Ebonyi State,” he said.
