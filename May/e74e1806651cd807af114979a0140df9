The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has revealed that it receives over 40 vandalisation reports on telecom structures across the federation daily. It said the situation underlines the need for all stakeholders to put hands together toward protecting the structures as theirs. This was stated by the Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Professor Umar Garba Danbatta, during a telecom consumer conversation village square dialogue with the theme ‘Protection of Telecom infrastructure for improved quality of service, the role of residents,’ organised by the NCC. Represented by NCC Director Technical Standard and Network Integrity Department, Engr Bako Wakili, at the event, Danbatta said the commission is sensitizing the public on the need for communities to own up the structure. He said vandalisation of telecom structures reduced the quality of service as well as coverage area leading to dead spots on the network which result in poor quality of service, adding that it also discouraged investors from investing in Nigeria should their infrastructures be continuously vandalized or stolen. Similarly, NCC Zonal controller Kano, Malam Shu’aibu Swade, said there is the need for robust sensitization to solicit for communities’ cooperation in protecting and guarding telecom structures for improved quality services to consumers. He further stated that there is need for the communities to understand that it is a duty upon them not to damage telecom infrastructure and also to allow installation of equipment and maintenance and or repairs on sites by technical staff of service providers for quality telecom service delivery.
