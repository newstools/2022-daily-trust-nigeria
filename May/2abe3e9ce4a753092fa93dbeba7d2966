 Nexford University, a US-based university, has announced a partnership with major employers in Africa to launch a platform for fresh graduates. In a statement yesterday, it stated that the coalition aims to bridge gaps between employers and Nexford University to the benefit of talent across the world. “Members of the coalition program are forward-thinking employers committed to leveraging education to drive business performance. These employers recognise the value of upskilling and reskilling their team members, in addition to the value of partnering with universities to recruit qualified entry-level talent.” It added that in 2021, it launched its Learn to Earn (LTE) pathway programmes to connect aspiring talent to businesses and facilitate graduate recruitment. “Initial members of this ‘Career Coalition’ include a diverse range of leading employers such as Allianz, Sterling Bank, Venture for Capital, Eva Pharma, Hassan Allam Holding and open banking fintech company Mono. Employers participating in the program will share data about their workforce and skill gaps with Nexford, which the university will use to design tailored pathway programs for learners to acquire the ideal skill sets that best fit with the needs of partner employers.” The CEO of Nexford, Fadl Al-Tarzi stated the program was designed to integrate employer needs into Nexford’s programs by creating more meaningful connections between employers and talent.
