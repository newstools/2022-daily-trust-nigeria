The Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Bashir Jamoh, has said the maritime sector has over 600,000 human capacity gaps. Dr Jamoh noted that there was an urgent need for a conscious effort for the training of more seafarers and dockworkers in Nigeria. He stated this on Wednesday when he received the management of Greg Ogbeifun Institute of Maritime Technology (GOMIT), together with their partners from the Training Centre for Blue Collar Port Workers in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium, and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation members. Jamoh said, “Studies have established over 600,000 human capacity skills gaps in the maritime sector. The need for more seafarers and dockworkers in Nigeria is obvious. Training and retraining of manpower are required for a virile maritime industry.” The Chairman of GOMIT, Engr Greg Ogbeifun, said the institute was committed to collaborating with existing institutes. He commended the NIMASA management for championing the quest to secure both fiscal and monetary incentives for stakeholders in the maritime industry He said, “We at GOMIT are committed to attaining internationally acceptable standards in training dockworkers. Government should provide us with the enabling environment to achieve our goal. “We will identify a training need assessment for pool workers. We consider certification as a key component of the training loop.”
