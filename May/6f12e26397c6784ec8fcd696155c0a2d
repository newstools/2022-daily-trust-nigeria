However, we also grew Life and Health businesses by 58% and 24% respectively whilst our P & C business dipped 5% as a result of large unrenewable business written in 2021 and deliberate careful selection of risk in 2022. The decline of 84% and 85% respectively in the PBT and PAT is largely driven by higher claims experienced in our health portfolio coupled with fair value losses and foreign exchange losses. Also on the financial growth at the end of the first quarter of 2022, the Chief Executive Officer, AXA Mansard Insurance, Kunle Ahmed, confirmed that they have begun the fiscal year 2022 on a solid footing, though they recorded a temporary setback on PBT despite growing revenue by double digit.
