A member representing Takai/Sumaila Federal Constituency of Kano State, Hon Shamsudeen Bello Dambazau, has defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) under the leadership of Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso. He is the son of a former Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau, who is a chieftain of the ruling APC. Dambazau, who did not disclose the reasons for his defection, however, said unfortunate development within the APC in the state necessitated his move. In a statement released to journalists, he stressed that sincere sacrifices have to be made in a bid to solve “deep-rooted national problems”, hence the need to move on. “Today, I Hon Shamsudeen Bello Dambazau has formally decamped to the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) under the leadership of Engr Dr Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, a man of integrity and respect. “This came after due consultations with my team and supporters. “Recent developments within the party make it almost impossible to continue participating and making productive contributions to the advantage of the party and the people of my constituency. “Our national problems are deep-rooted and require that we all make sincere sacrifices towards rescuing our constituencies, states and country at large. “My commitment to rescuing my constituency and Kano State remains firm even if the routes vary. “I wish to extend my appreciation personally for the opportunity to serve within the party but it is time I move on to where our interests align,” the statement said.
