A former Vice President and leading presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has unveiled a five-point agenda, which he said will revamp Nigeria’s ailing economy and transform its political landscape. The agenda is contained in a policy document released Wednesday from his campaign office in Abuja. In the document, Atiku said, “I am offering myself again to provide the desired leadership. I have a history of economic reform and political transformation. As a private businessman of many years, I have a deep understanding of our economy and its challenges.” According to him, while he was vice president he led the economic management team and is credited for designing the private sector revival strategy and opening up the economy for private sector investments, especially in the IT sector which is now one the fastest growing services sector in the Nigerian economy. He said he would replicate this on a larger scale with a five-point development agenda that seeks to restore Nigeria’s unity through equity; establish a strong and effective democratic government; build a strong, resilient and prosperous economy; promote a true federal system and improve and strengthen the education system to equip its recipients with the education and skills required to be competitive in the new global order. Atiku noted that though the APC-led government continued to blame the opposition and other external factors for the woes, it was evident that that there was a leadership vacuum that needed to be filled with competent hands.
