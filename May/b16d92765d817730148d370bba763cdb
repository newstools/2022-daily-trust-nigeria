The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Wednesday upheld the disqualification of two of its 17 presidential aspirants, Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmas Ndukwe. The two aspirants however appealed against their disqualification by the Senator David Mark-led screening committee. A 9-member screening committee led by former Senate President David Mark had last week disqualified the two aspirants for their alleged failure to meet the requirements set out by the party. But the appeal committee led by the party’s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday was said to have upheld the disqualification of the two aspirants. Even though the committee refused to speak with newsmen, Daily Trust gathered that they upheld the recommendation of the Senator David Mark-led committee. Meanwhile, protesters mainly youths, who said they were from the six geo-political zones, on Wednesday stormed the national secretariat of the party to protest the silence of the party on the zoning of its presidential ticket. The protesters stated that a southern member of the party must take over from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 as part of the zoning arrangement of the party. Convener of the protesters, Femi Osabinu, said, “We are seriously concerned as patriotic Nigerians, that just a few days to the presidential primaries of our party, the party is yet to intimate Nigerians about its decision, in respect of where it is zoning the presidential ticket to.”
