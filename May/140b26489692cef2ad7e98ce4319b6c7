Swiss luxury watchmaker IWC said it has partnered with PoloLuxury, a Nigerian watch retailer, to unveil its products in the local market. In a statement issued in Lagos yesterday, the company said the partnership is meant to bring the Swiss watchmaker to a booming watch market in Nigeria. With IWC’s entry into the market, timepiece collectors are granted access to the 154-year legacy of watch-making innovation with products like the Portugieser, the Pilot Watch, and the Da Vinci. PoloLuxury is the official retailer for some of the most prestigious Swiss watch brands in the world, which include Rolex, Cartier, Piaget, Chopard, Longines, and IWC, among others. Polo said with this track record, IWC decided to bring its products closer to its Nigerian customers, the statement noted. IWC has a progressive outlook with cutting-edge American technology and Swiss craftsmanship. Commenting on the partnership, the Executive Director of Polo, Mrs Jennifer Obayuwana, commended the re-invention of watches for women by IWC. Also speaking on the durability of the watches, Mrs Obayuwana said: “IWC uses bronze for the manufacture of its products. For us in the watch-making business, this is innovation because bronze is a material scarcely used by watchmakers. “The brand is also dynamic in its ability to cater for its fans in aviation with truly sporty, active, and fast-moving lifestyles while serving a distinctly conservative demographic as well,” she stated.
