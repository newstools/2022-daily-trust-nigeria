The three gladiators in the Zamfara State All Progressives Congress (APC) crisis have sealed reconciliation pact. The state’s governor, Bello Matawalle; his predecessor, Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa have agreed to work together in the interest of the state and its people. The National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, moved in to resolve the protracted crisis rocking the party in the state. Twice, he met with Matawalle and Yari in a bid to resolve the matter. Marafa was absent during the two meetings. To brief members of his camp on the reconciliation moves, Marafa convened a stakeholders’ meeting in Abuja with Matawalle and Yari in attendance. He briefed members of his camp about the reconciliation and sought their position on the matter. Yari, on his part, said the decision was taken in the best interest of the party and the people of the state, urging all to support it. Matawalle expressed joy with the development, saying: “We should forgive ourselves; I have forgiven all. I accept this reconciliation and vow to give my maximum cooperation to its success.”
