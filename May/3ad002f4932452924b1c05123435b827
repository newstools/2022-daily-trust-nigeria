Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 10 wards of Egor Local Government Area in Edo State, Thursday, staged a protest over the alleged substitution of the lists of elected Adhoc delegates ahead of the party’s primaries. The protesters accused the party’s chairman in the local government, Emma Iyase, of doctoring the delegates’ list of the party. Speaking with journalists during the protest in Benin, Osifo Imafidon Edwin, ward 2 chairman of the party, described the alleged substitution of the elected Adhoc delegates’ list as undemocratic. He said the development is capable of contributing to the failure of the party in the forthcoming general elections. He urged the party leadership in the state to do the needful by ensuring that the substituted lists are reversed, adding that they will make the party lose the general elections in the locality if the right thing was not done. On his part, Ibrahim Momoh, ward 10 legal adviser, said the primary election will not hold in the local government area if the party failed to do the needful. Addressing the protesters, the party’s women leader in the state, Betty Okoebor, assured the protesters that their grievances will be looked into with a view to resolving their complaints.
