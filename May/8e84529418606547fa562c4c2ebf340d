The police in Ogun State have arrested a 36-year-old man, Kingsley Essien, for trafficking his wife to Mali for prostitution and selling his two-year-old son for N600,000. The police spokesman in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspect was arrested following a report lodged at the Agbara division by his wife, Bright Essien. Oyeyemi said the wife told the police that her husband informed her of securing a job for her in Bamako, Mali, last year October. He quoted her as saying that she didn’t suspect any foul play because he had assisted many people to Mali for greener pasture. According to him, the wife said when she got to Mali, she discovered that she had been sold at the rate of N1.4m to a human trafficking cartel headed by a woman. Oyeyemi further said, “While in Mali, she was forced into prostitution, but later found her way to the Nigeria embassy in Bamako where she was assisted back to Nigeria. “On getting to Nigeria, she discovered that her two-year-old son in the care of her husband was nowhere to be found.” When the husband was arrested, Oyeyemi said, “On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime. He confessed further that he sold the two-year-old son to somebody at the rate of N600,000.” He added that while the suspect was in custody, the buyer of the son was being trailed by the police.
