Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi and a ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant has promised to bring to bear practical leadership to address the present predicament in the country. Addressing Imo State APC delegates, the Governor said his track record of performance as Governor place him above other aspirants. Umahi’s speech made available to Daily Trust in Abuja said, “with my practical professional skills and proven passion for service delivery, I shall offer a practical leadership that will address the various challenges that undermine the great potentials of our Nation.” He promised that If elected President, “we shall run a participatory government and together develop policy frameworks that will enhance the physical and social environment and tackle corruption and insecurity. “We shall address squarely the problems that deter the growth of our economy especially through the creation of critical infrastructure and manpower development; including power, industrialization, road & railways development, agro and tech-based innovations, digital economy, quality and accessible education and healthcare for all strata of our people. “We shall raise the human capital base of our population and engage them to be productively beneficial in the development of our economy. We shall deepen the cause of Nation-Building through good governance built on fairness and justice for all.” He said with the present situation in the country, “Nigerians need to bring on board a President with proven records of performance, not those who make vain promises, but lack the discipline, moral rectitude and mental resources to walk the talk. “Nigerians need to make a choice based on evidence of performance, passion for service, fiscal discipline and nationalism. I therefore present my profile and credentials to you, with a sincere heart to anchor a macrocosm of the microcosm of my performance as Governor of Ebonyi State.”
