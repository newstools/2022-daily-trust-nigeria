He said 15 passengers out of 49 on board sustained injuries and were rushed to the hospital men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). When contacted, the Abaji Unit Commander of the FRSC, ACC Shehu Abubakar Dogondaji, confirmed the accident, which he attributed to tyre bust, speed limit violation and loss of control.
