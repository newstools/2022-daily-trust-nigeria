A fresh crisis is rocking the South West zone of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as stakeholders have disowned the acting national chairman, Alhaji Shehu Musa Garba, and the Secretary of the party, Dr Olu Agunloye. The stakeholders of the party who met Wednesday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, also threatened to stop the national convention of the party being proposed by the embattled chairman and equally hinted of taking legal action in that regard. They also cautioned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to desist from granting recognition to the duo of Dr Agunloye and Musa Garba whom they described as a “cabal” in the party. Speaking with newsmen after their meeting, Chairman of the South West Concern Stakeholders of SDP, Dr Sola Agboola, called on the presidential aspirant of the party, Adewole Adebayo, and other aspirants to beware of the executive so as not to be victims of misfortune. Agboola urged the leadership of the party to ensure reconciliation so as not to jeopardise chances of the party in the next election. He said, “We are here to let the public know about all illegality going on in this party. Agunloye should vacate his office because whatever he does now is void and takes no effect. “He should stop interfering in the affairs of the party in the South West. We are saying no to position swapping. We are saying no to the leadership of Alhaji Sheu Musa Garba as the party interim National Chairman. “The proposed SDP national convention is illegal. We have met here and we are heading to court to seek redress.”
