Horse-trading is gathering steam in the Kebbi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the senatorial ambition of Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu. The governor, who will complete his second term in May 2023, is seeking the party’s ticket for Kebbi Central Senatorial District. The seat is currently occupied by Senator Adamu Aliero, who also is seeking re-election on the platform of APC. There had been a frosty relationship between Aliero and Bagudu since APC’s congresses in the state.  The duo was competing for the control of the party’s structure. The lawmaker lamented imposition of candidates during the congresses and the removal of party members perceived to be loyal to him in the hierarchy of the leadership of the party. Speaking during a political rally in January, Aliero said political calamity awaited APC in the state if the party failed to treat all members with fairness. “There would be severe consequences if APC in Kebbi State fails to be fair to all. During the last congress of the party, some members were selfishly removed as leaders while others were imposed to take over their positions. We will not allow that to be and it will remain unacceptable,” he said. Political watchers in the state said the state governor stands a better chance of clinching the party’s senatorial ticket. They noted that the state’s chapter of APC is populated mostly by his loyalists. The power of incumbency may also work in his favour.
