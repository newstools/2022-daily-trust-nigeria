 The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has completed the Seventh National Action Plan (NAP 7.0) targeted at delivering 57 reforms within the 60-day accelerator window. The Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business and PEBEC Secretary, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, on Sunday in Abuja, said this followed the 30-day extension of the previous completion date of April 6. According to her, the NAP 7.0 concluded with an overall completion rate of 50 per cent and marks the end of the 90-day accelerated reform cycle targeted at implementing reforms for improved efficiency and transparency of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). She said, “The PEBEC, at its meeting held in January, 2022, had approved the commencement of NAP 7.0 to run from February 7, 2022, to April 7, 2022, with a target to deliver 57 reforms within the 60-day accelerator window. “Some of the participating MDAs include the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), Trademark Registry (Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment), Citizens and Business Department (Ministry of Interior), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS) and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). “The NAP 7.0 was designed to further reduce the challenges faced by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across four areas -Agro-Export Implementation Action Plan, Automation Reforms, Regulatory Reforms, and Executive Order 01/ReportGov.NG compliance reforms.” She said the reforms included the streamlining and simplification of ago-export regulatory practices with a view to boosting the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-exports while enhancing Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings as stated in the agro-export plan.
