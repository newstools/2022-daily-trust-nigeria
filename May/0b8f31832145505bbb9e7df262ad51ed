The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) have agreed to address non-compliance with trade rules by exporters, a situation that is hampering non-oil exports in Nigeria. They also resolved to address head-on the challenges facing the export of non-oil products in Nigeria. Both agencies made the commitment during a courtesy call by the management of the NEPC to the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Mr. Emmanuel Jime. Jime indicated that one of the challenges of non-oil export in the country was the non-compliance with trade rules by exporters. “Non-oil compliance to trade rules is actually a problem of exporters and importers. To address this challenge, the Council will like to collaborate with the NEPC to organize more enlightenment programmes so that exporters and importers can imbibe ethics of integrity in international trade,” he stated. The ES also stated that “the NSC and NEPC are partnering on the establishment of Export Domestic Ware Houses”. The Executive Director of NEPC, Dr. Ezra Yakusak commended the NSC for the active role in the Domestic Warehouse Initiative. He said the Domestic Warehouse Initiative will address issues of logistics challenges facing non-oil exports, especially trucking challenges.
