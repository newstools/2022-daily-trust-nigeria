 The Deputy Senate President and contender for the governorship of Delta State, Obarisi Ovie Omo-Agege, has appointed a former presidential spokesman, Ima Niboro, to lead the communications and media strategy team for his campaign organisation. He said in a statement yesterday that the choice of the award-winning journalist and former Managing Director (MD) of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) signalled his unshakable commitment to bring on board only the best and brightest to the campaign organisation. Sen Omo-Agege noted that the quest to liberate Delta State from the grip of those who did not wish it well was urgent and overwhelming. He said, “We will bring in our best brains, we will put all willing hands on deck, we will lead from the front and we will win.”
