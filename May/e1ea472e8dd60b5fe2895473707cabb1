 A two-time member of the House of Representatives, Hon Ahmed Wadada Aliyu, has said he is in the race for the Nasarawa West Senatorial District seat to replace Senator Abdullahi Adamu and ensure that enabling laws are put in place that will diversify, deepen and grow the socio-economic well-being of his constituents. Hon Aliyu stated this in Abuja in an interview with newsmen shortly after purchasing his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the election. Recall that Senator Adamu recently vacated his seat following his emergence as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the party’s March 26, 2022, national convention. The senatorial aspirant said he would explore all democratic ways to provide more development to his constituency looking at its proximity to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. He said, “I’m robust; I have the experience in both private and public sectors, and the National Assembly will not be a new place to me. I was a member of the fifth and the sixth assemblies and my representation was well-felt not only in my constituency and my state, but in Nigeria as a whole.”
