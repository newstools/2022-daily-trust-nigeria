 The Commissioner for Public Complaints Commission (PCC) representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Comrade Ezekiel Musa Dalhattu, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint a native of the territory as a minister. He said the president should take advantage of the vacuum created by some ministers who resigned their positions to appoint an FCT native into his cabinet. Speaking with newsmen in Abuja over the weekend, Dalhattu said the call followed complaints written to the commission by some FCT indigenous Civil Society Organisations (CSOs): Coalition of FCT Indigenous Associations (CFIA), Abuja Grassroots Project (AGP) and as well FCT Indigenous Women Association (FIWA).
