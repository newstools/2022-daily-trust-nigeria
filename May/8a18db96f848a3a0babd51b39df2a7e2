An International Activist, Philanthropist and a renowned motivational speaker, Dr. Raymond Edoh, has bagged a continental award. The 2022 Royal African Young Leadership Forum Award was given to him by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II. Edoh was also inducted into the Royal Court of the Kingdom of Ife at the third edition of the RAYLF award ceremony alongside 99 others which took place in Ile-Ife last Saturday. Ooni, while presenting the award to Raymond, said, “all the award recipients like Raymond are on the road, prepared for Nigeria and African leadership. These young ones will change the narrative of leadership. “I am a servant leader and felt not used enough. I urge the youths to legitimately climb my back to cross any bridge.” Ooni appreciated Edoh for his impact on the African continent urging him to keep the good work going, as he stressed that there is always a day for reward. “The 100 outstanding young personalities are today honoured in different categories of the award covering five RAYLF pillars of governance and leadership, technology and innovation, entrepreneurship and empowerment, creative culture, and academic excellence. You specifically have done well, keep on and the sky is your starting point,” Ooni said. Reacting to the award, Edoh expressed deep gratitude to the Ooni, the entire African youths, and more specifically, the Nigerian Youths for believing in him to have passed through all the screening stages. He said, “I want to re-dedicate this award to the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, OJAJA II, and the entire African youths. “I felt really encouraged by this and I would continue to remain at the service of every youth in Nigeria and Africa at large, same as our father the imperial majesty says and I quote, “I’m your servant I don’t feel used enough, use me”, and he further says “climb my back.”
