 The Ogun State Government has ordered the immediate sealing of a cashew nut producing company, SONATA Agri International Limited, located at Kilometre 51 along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Mowe, for causing air and water pollution in the area. The Director, Compliance Monitoring in the state, Babatunde Lawal, who led a team on an enforcement tour, said the air generated from the plant was posing a great threat to human lives, particularly to pregnant women and children. Reacting to the closure, the company’s Executive Director, Alhaji Mustapha Lamidi, promised that the company would adhere strictly to the environmental laws of the state if given a second chance.
