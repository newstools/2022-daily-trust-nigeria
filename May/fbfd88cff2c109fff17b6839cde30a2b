At least 4 presidential and 30 governorship aspirants have picked the nomination and expression of interest forms of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). The party did not produce a presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections. The four aspirants contesting the PRP’s presidential ticket for the 2023 election are the son of the late presumed winner of the June 1993 elections, Kola Abiola, Dr Usman Bugaje, Col Gboluga Mosugu and a female aspirant, Mrs Patience Key. The party has set May 18 as the deadline for the purchase of the forms, May 19 for submission and May 31 for presidential primary. “At the last count, four party members have picked the nomination and expression of interest forms for the presidential ticket of the party. The deadline is May 18, and I don’t know whether other people will purchase the forms, but this is the number as at today,” a source at the party secretariat told Daily Trust yesterday. “Also, not less than 30 governorship aspirants have also purchased the forms. By Wednesday, we will have the final list of those that have taken the form and on Thursday, those that have submitted,” he added. The party pegs its presidential forms at N10 million, N2.5 million for the governorship, N1.5 million for Senate, House of Representatives, N250,000, and N100,000 for the state House of Assembly. All the female aspirants were expected to pay fifty per cent of the cost of the forms, while the disabled will be given the forms for free. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Malam Ibrahim Adamu Tudun-Doki, said the party has been repositioned and revamped to take over power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. He also said the money politics and internal wrangling within the two main political parties, the APC and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will benefit the PRP.
