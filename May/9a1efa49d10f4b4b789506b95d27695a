The crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State has assumed a new dimension with the emergence of two governorship candidates. The crisis made the party lose its prominent members to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the fast rising New Nigeria’s Peoples Party (NNPP). On Thursday, Sadiq Wali, son of Aminu Wali, Nigeria’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Muhammad Abacha, son of the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha, were declared winners of the primaries conducted by factions of the party. The faction loyal to Aminu Wali is led by Bello Hayatu Gwarzo while Abacha’s son belongs to the faction led by Shehu Wada Sagagi. The Gwarzo led faction held its primaries at the Sani Abacha Youth Centre while the other faction conducted its own at the state secretariat. Wali, who was until April a commissioner in the administration Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, remained a card-carrying member of the PDP in the APC government. He served as the Commissioner for Water Resources. His appointment after the well-contested 2019 gubernatorial election had led to a faction of the PDP accusing Ambassador Aminu Wali selling out the party.
