Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has called on the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning to set up modalities for intensifying mobilisation and publicity about the whistleblower policy in order to educate, sensitise and motivate the public in the fight against corruption. The governor made the plea yesterday in Maiduguri during the North East Zonal Conference on Whistle Blower Policy in Nigeria with the theme: “Implementation of Whistle Blower Policy in Nigeria: Issues, Challenges and Way Forward”, organised by the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning. Represented by the Deputy Governor, Umar Usman Kadafur, Zulum explained that communication gap had been a major hurdle against the whistleblower policy, particularly in this part of the country. He said, “If properly handled this policy will effectively strengthen the fight against corruption across the country. “Let me put it on record that we have taken bold step to curb the menace of corruption in both local governments and state civil services by blocking identified leakages and enhancing the revenue base of the states, as well as the introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) which attributed the huge revenue generated for the 2021 physical year. “It is our belief this year that there will be increase of revenue base in the state by our projection. Internally Generated Revenue accrued to the state in the last three years of this administration has greatly aided our recovery and resettlement efforts.” Earlier in her remarks, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, who was represented by Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar, told the delegates that the three previous conferences recorded huge successes in terms of organisation, participation and sensitisation of the public on the implementation of the policy.
