The management of Kaduna Electric has warned customers to beware of fraudsters asking them to pay for meters or for installation. The company, in a statement issued yesterday by its Head of Energy Metering, Engineer Aliyu Mohammed Gana, said any such demand either by its staff or an installer should be reported immediately to the company’s nearest office. He then urged customers and the general public not to pay a kobo for meters under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), saying that meters under the scheme are free. “Any installer or staff requesting payment from customers should be reported to the company. Customers who have not yet been metered should be patient as the deployment of meters under the NMMP is in phases,” he said. He said phase 0 of the programme is being concluded and that Phase 1 will commence as soon as the federal government gave the go-ahead. “Customers who are unwilling to wait for meters under NMMP can apply for a meter under the ongoing Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme which comes at a cost but that the cost of the meter shall be amortised and customers refunded through electricity units whenever they bought. “The introduction of both NMMP and MAP schemes is to close the metering gap so that the cases of estimated billing would be reduced to a minimum,” he added.
