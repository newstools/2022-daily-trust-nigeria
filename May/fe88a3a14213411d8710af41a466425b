Popular columnist and fierce critic of the the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, Prof. Farooq Kperogi, has slammed the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, over the outcome of the Lagos APC governorship primary. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whom Tinubu endorsed for a second term, clinched the party’s ticket at the primary, which was fraught with controversies over the exclusion of the two aspirants who bought forms to challenge Sanwo-Olu. The duo of Wale Oluwo, a former Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources in the state, and Abdul-Ahmed Mustapha, a former Permanent Secretary, were barred from Mobolaji Johnson Arena (Onikan Stadium), venue of the primary. Adamu Yuguda, chairman of the five-man electoral committee, later said only the incumbent governor was cleared for the exercise. Yuguda had said, “We are aware that three aspirants bought forms for Lagos State. Three accredited for the screening. One was cleared, two were not cleared. So, we are only attending to those that have been cleared, the aspirant that has been cleared by the two committees.” But responding, Oluwo accused the electoral committee of conspiring with some politicians to manipulate the exercise. The issue of denying the aspirants access to the venue of the election generated a heated debate on Thursday. Reacting in a Facebook post, Kperogi said karma was waiting for Tinubu at the APC presidential primary, which begins on Sunday. “Tinubu endorsed a disgraceful coronation of his handpicked stooge in the Lagos governorship primary “election” and shut out 2 other contestants who paid nomination fees. But he wants a fair contest for his presidential ambition in Abuja and chafes at consensus. Karma is waiting for him in Abuja this weekend!,” Kperogi said.
