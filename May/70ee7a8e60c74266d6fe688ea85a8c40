A suit filed by the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to restrain the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, from preventing him from pursuing his presidential ambition, yesterday suffered setbacks. Emefiele on Monday, through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), told the Federal High Court in Abuja that he can run for the post of the president without vacating his position as the apex bank governor but the court declined the request. Gunmen lay siege on A/Ibom communities, kidnap priest, 18 others FCTA expanding water access – Board GM Ozekhome told the court that Section 84 ((12) of the Electoral Act as amended, does not affect Emefiele, being a public servant and not a political appointee. The court also summoned INEC and AGF to appear before it on May 12, to show cause on why status quo antebellum, should not be granted to the CBN Governor. Daily Trust reports that Section 9 of the CBN Act, 2007, states that the apex bank governor must not venture into any other vocation while in office and must resign in writing to the president if he nursed such intention. It read, “The Governor and the Deputy Governors shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the bank and while holding office shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation whether remunerated or not except such personal or charitable causes as may be determined by the Board and which do not conflict with or detract from their full-time duties…”
