The Director-General (DG) of the Cross River Primary Healthcare Care Agency, Dr Janet Ekpenyong, has confirmed the death of seven children from cholera in the state. Dr Ekpenyong, who confirmed the deaths in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Calabar, said her agency recorded more than 600 suspected cases in the state between March and April. She said, “Over 600 suspected cases were detected and we had a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) conducted on them. We also did microscopic tests and culture to have true confirmation of the cases. “We confirmed that most of the cases were not cholera-related, though we had three active cases of the disease in Ogoja LGA. “Whenever we go for medical outreach and detect suspected cases of cholera with symptoms such as diarrhoea, we take samples immediately. Thereafter, the rapid diagnostic test is carried out and treatment initiated immediately.”
