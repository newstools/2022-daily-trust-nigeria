 Ahead of the May 30 presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a group of Nigerian Women, have pledged support for the aspiration of Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo, one of the aspirants jostling to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Addressing a press conference on Monday in Abuja, the women under the aegis of Dolapo Osinbajo Friends and Fans (DOFF), said that one of the reasons for their support for Osinbajo was his unquestionable loyalty to Nigerians in the past seven and a half years. The Director General of DOFF, Mrs. Bolanle Kaji-Hausa, who said Osinbajo is ‘The best aspirant’, in the race to the presidency, said the organisation was birthed long before the vice president declared interest to vie for the highest elective office. Kaji-Hausa said, “Not long before Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo declared to run for the 2023 presidential election on the platform of our great party, the APC, fate beckoned on me to create and run this support group.”
