Kano State governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has reconciled with one of the leaders of the factional G-7 in the state All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Barau Jibrin, Daily Trust gathered. Barau, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, currently represents Kano North Senatorial District in the Red Chamber; a position Governor Ganduje has indicated interest to occupy in 2023. But sources said the governor has now decided to shelve his senatorial bid and endorse Barau to return to the Red Chamber following peace talks between the two. Confirming the development to Daily Trust, Ibrahim Zakari Sarina, the secretary of the party in Kano, said the peace talk was successful. “The process is ongoing,” he said, concerning reports that Ganduje has endorsed Barau for the senatorial seat. Daily Trust reports that the G-7, which is led by Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, suffered a huge defeat at the Supreme Court penultimate week and since then, its members have been making moves to secure their political future. While some members of the House of Representatives that belong to the group had joined the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), G-7 leader, Shekarau, is said to be concluding plans to also announce his defection to the party (NNPP).
