A former All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba II, has joined the Young Progressives Party (YPP). Speaking with newsmen yesterday in Abuja after picking YPP’s presidential forms, Garba said the youths had no future in the ruling APC or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Daily Trust reports that while the YPP presidential forms cost N15m, Garba paid N7.5m because he is under 40 years, as par the party’s policy for women and youths. Garba will contend with the son of the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim, for the party’s presidential ticket. Garba had, last week, withdrawn from contesting the APC presidential ticket after generating N83.2m in private and online donations. He said he withdrew from the race due to the high cost of obtaining the N100m APC forms for the presidency and the cost of running for the office. He promised that the funds he generated as an APC presidential would be returned to the donors.
