A female aspirant for Oyo North senatorial district on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mrs Adebola Adeboyin, has appealed to delegates to vote for her as the party’s candidate in the senatorial zone. Speaking with journalists in Ibadan, Oyo State, ahead of the party’s senatorial primary, Adeboyin, a banker, said she has what it takes to provide the district quality representation at the National Assembly. “As the only woman among the three contestants, I have what it takes to represent the people, and as a mother, I know what children want from their parents. “I am using this opportunity to call on the delegates and party chieftains to support me. I won’t disappoint you,” she said.
