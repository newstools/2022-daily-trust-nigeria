 The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr Abiodun Alabi, has ordered massive deployment of policemen across the metropolis to protect public installations during and after the public holidays. He also said plain clothe detectives would be posted to worship and event centres in the metropolis to forestall breakdown of law and order. Mr Alabi, in his Ramadan message, urged parents and guardians to be weary of those who their children went out with during the holidays, noting that criminals might take undue advantage of the innocence of some youths to lure them into criminal dens. Alabi, who promised to ensure the safety of lives and properties of Lagosians during the holidays, advised criminal gangs to stay away from the state or would be made to face the full wrath of the law. He further advised everyone to be security conscious, vigilant and report any suspicious incident or happening to the nearest police station.
