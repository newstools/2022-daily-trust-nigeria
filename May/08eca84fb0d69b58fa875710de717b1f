Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, yesterday, staged a protest in Benin, the state capital, over the substitution of the list of elected delegates. The protesters accused the party’s Chairman in the local government, Emma Iyase, of doctoring the delegates’ list. Speaking with journalists in Benin, Osifo Imafidon Edwin, Ward 2 chairman, described the alleged substitution of the elected delegates list as undemocratic. He said the development was capable of contributing to the failure of the party in the general elections. He, therefore, urged the party’s leadership in the state to do the needful by ensuring that the substituted list was reversed. According to him, the aggrieved members have threatened that they would not work for the party’s victory in the general elections if the right thing is not done. Addressing the protesters, the state Women Leader of APC, Betty Okoebor, assured them that their grievances would be looked into with a view to resolving them.
