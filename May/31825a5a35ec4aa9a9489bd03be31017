Former Governor of Kano state and leader of the G-7 faction of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau has debunked reports insinuating he has dumped the group. The disclaimer was issued Thursday evening through his spokesman, Dr Sule Yau Sule, who told Daily Trust the reports (not by Daily Trust) were mischievous.

But following the obtaining of the nomination and expression of interest forms by Shekarau on Thursday for his return to the Senate, reports emanated on social media that the former governor has dumped the group and pitched his tent with the governor’s faction. The reports had insinuated that the former governor was wooed with an automatic ticket for his return to the red chamber and had therefore abandoned the struggle he was championing. However, Shekarau’s spokesman, Dr Sule Yau Sule told Daily Trust late Thursday that the reports were nothing but the handiwork of mischief-makers. He said before Shekarau obtained his nomination and expression of interest forms, other members of the group that also desire to pursue political ambitions have started obtaining the forms. He said this was because even as the Supreme Court was yet to deliver its verdict in their appeal, they figured that they had to take steps especially as the purchasing of the forms was earlier scheduled to close on Friday before it was later extended. “His Excellency (Shekarau) is still the bonafide leader of the G-7 and there is no action he or any of the group members take that is not known to all other members,” Sule said.
