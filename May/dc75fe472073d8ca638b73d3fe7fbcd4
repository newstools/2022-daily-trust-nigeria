The Social Democratic Party (SDP) says its presidential primary will hold on June 8, 2022 in Abuja. The SDP National Chairman, Alhaji Shehu Musa Gabam, said this Monday in Abuja at the inauguration of the party’s National Convention Organising Committee. He said the committee is chaired by a former governor of Ekiti State, Chief Segun Oni. Other members of the committee are Dr. Olu Agunloye, who will serve as secretary; Ibrahim Modibbo, deputy chairman; Dr Umar Ardo, Nseobong Akpabio, Emmanuel Ojukwu, Saadatu Abdullahi, Maggie Batubo, Alkali Mohammed and Gift Wada. Meanwhile, Gabam has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure a level playing ground for all parties during the June 18 Ekiti State governorship election. According to him, the president’s statement that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would win the Ekiti poll might affect the overall credibility of the entire electoral process.
