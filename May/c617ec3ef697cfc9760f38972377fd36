The Eicher Pro 2000 series which was unveiled by A.G. Leventis Nig Ltd on October 12, 2021, is set to hit the market in September, 2022, after successful trials of the vehicles. This Pro series, including Eicher Pro 2049, Eicher Pro 2070 and Eicher Pro 6019, make the fifth generation of the Eicher brand, which was first manufactured in 1986. Commercial Manager, FMCG, Haulage and Logistics of A.G. Leventis Nig Ltd, Charles Awani, said the vehicles would be released to the market after they had undergone series of trials to ensure they were suitable for their customers. He said, “Some of our trucks were also given to some of our customers: Hightech, Grocery Bazaar, etc. for a few weeks to be tested. We are also running the vehicles in-house because we want to attain 15,000km. Afterwards we will write a report about the trucks.” He added that among the Pro series was a tipper, reiterating that the vehicles would only be released to the market after the company was certain that the truck would be suitable for the Nigerian region. Group Managing Director and CEO of A.G. Leventis Nig Ltd, Seun Oni, stated that the company was very passionate about the feedback from stakeholders in their value chain as it helped the company restrategise on what to do differently to serve the customers better. Oni said, “The strength of any business lies in the resilience and the depth of the ecosystem it carries and that is what our customers represent.”
