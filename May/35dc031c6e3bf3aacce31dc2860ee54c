The event scheduled to be held from 7 – 8 June would have leading manufacturers and providers of transport technology solutions also showcasing the latest and future-proved transport technology solutions at this first of its kind transport fair. Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, explained that discussions geared towards improving efficiency and sustainability of transport technology solutions in Nigeria for proper implementation and development and other topical issues will be clearly highlighted at the conference. At the conference, search light will also be beamed on the road transportation sector which is perceived to have been ignored while solutions will be proffered to challenges faced daily by the operators and users alike. Some of the challenges are: traffic congestion, road accidents, parking problems and environmental pollution among others. “We believe strongly that coming together under the same umbrella of all commissioners for transport nationwide will give a better avenue for seamless implementation for resolutions reached at the conference,” Oladeinde said.
