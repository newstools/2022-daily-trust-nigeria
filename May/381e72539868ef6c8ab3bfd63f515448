At least seven soldiers and 20 “terrorists” lost their lives following militant attacks on two military bases in the north of Burkina Faso. According to a statement, four volunteers aiding the army in the fight against militants were also killed in the attacks on Thursday in Loroum and Sanmatenga provinces. BBC quoted the army as saying that it seized or destroyed weapons, vehicles and communication equipment used by the attackers. The violence came a day after a soldier was killed and another wounded in a roadside blast in northern Burkina Faso.
