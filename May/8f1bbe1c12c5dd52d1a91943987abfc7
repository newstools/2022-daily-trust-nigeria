A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and aspirant in the Plateau State governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Garba Pwul, has warned against voting of highest bidders to positions during the upcoming primaries and the general elections. Chief Pwul said if the people wanted to get it right, money politics should be avoided while responding to journalists in Jos. I’ll grow Nigeria’s GDP to $1.5trn if elected president – Bakare I’ll transform Adamawa – PRP gov’ship aspirant He said, “You would notice that the electorate always regret electing money bags to leadership positions, but you see them committing the same mistake again in the next elections, and this has been the trend since 1999. “The point I am making is that voting the highest bidder to a leadership position is like taking a poison which would eventually kill you. In this case, it would kill your economy, kill your society and kill your future and the future of your children.”
