A Federal High Court in Abuja has refused an application by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking to strike out a suit by Ambassador Abubakar Waziri challenging his disqualification from the Adamawa State governorship primary. In a ruling, yesterday, on a preliminary objection by the PDP challenging the suit, Justice Obiora Egwuatu held that the court has jurisdiction to hear the suit as the case is of national interest. PDP, through its counsel, Edeze Esq, also contended that Waziri lacked the requisite locus standi and cause of action against the party, adding that none of his civil rights has been wronged under Section 6(6) of the Nigerian Constitution 1999. Earlier, counsel to Waziri, Louis Alozie (SAN), informed the court that the purported disqualification of Waziri was done in breach of the Electoral Act and the party guidelines after both Yola South LGA and the Steering Committee cleared him having fulfilled all the requirements to participate in the primary election. Waziri is seeking, among other reliefs, an order of court declaring that he is duly qualified to contest the governorship primary of the PDP in Adamawa State for the selection/election of the party’s candidate for the governorship election. The judge has slated June 17 for hearing.
