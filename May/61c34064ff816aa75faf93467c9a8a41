He said, “It has been over three months now that we have found ourselves in this situation, which has worsened commercial activities, insecurity and access to water, because we rely on generators to pump water. “These are in addition to the huge amounts we spend on fuel to power our generators and to fix them when they break down. We have written several letters to officials of the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company and the Kwara State Government for help but nothing has been done yet.” When contacted, the Commissioner for Energy, Aliyu Kora Sabi, said, “They have to exercise patience with us because there are people who wrote since 2013 but have not been responded to yet. “Presently, we don’t have transformers on ground, but we are expecting some and will distribute as soon as we receive them.”
