The Chairman of Kano State Council of Ulama, Sheikh Ibrahim Khalil, has emerged as the candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for the state’s 2023 governorship election through consensus. The party’s Chairman in the state, Musa Shu’aibu Ungogo, said the ADC national leadership visited Kano to present the N10m form to Shekih Khalil because of his personality. He said, “All other aspirants used to go to the party’s national secretariat in Abuja to obtain the form, but in the case of Khalil, after making the payment, they told him that the form would be presented to him in Kano. “This is why the leadership of the party, including the National chairman, national secretary and the North West vice chairman, came all the way to Kano to present it to him. “The national chairman also used the occasion to inaugurate the North West leadership of the party under Professor Kabiru Dandago.” He explained that only Sheikh Khalil obtained the form and accordingly emerged as the party’s consensus candidate in the state. Ungogo urged Kano voters to abandon the ruling APC and the opposition PDP, saying the two major political parties were responsible for the country’s present condition. Daily Trust reports that Sheikh Khalil dumped the APC for the ADC earlier this year after contested for the APC governorship ticket in 2019 without success.
