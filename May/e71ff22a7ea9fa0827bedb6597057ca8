The Coalition of Closed Unpaid Textiles Workers Association, Kaduna State has lamented the non-payment of their entitlement 20 years after the closure of many textile industries in the state. Staging a peaceful protest at the Kaduna Textile Limited (KTL) on Wednesday, the workers called on the Federal and Kaduna State governments to urgently come to their rescue by settling their unpaid entitlement to enable them to secure a better life for their children. The Chairman of the group, Comrade Jeibe Wordam Simdik explained that the textiles industry in Kaduna and some parts of the country fully contributed to the economic growth of the nation Simdik said, “Unfortunately, since the closure of these textile mills, we have faced many challenges which include non-medical health facility, it has affected our children’s education, some marriage got broken, while some people’s wives and children have become street hawkers, begging to be fed. “Our workers become rent tribunal customers for non-payment of rents. In view of the above many of our workers and family die under frustration, that is why we are calling on all meaning Nigeria to apply mercy and justice to our plight. He added, “The reopening of all closed textiles mills in Nigeria which includes; Kaduna Textiles Limited, Arewa Textiles PLC, NORTEX Nigeria Limited, and FINETEX Limited, will create job opportunities for the teeming youth and reduce insecurity in Nigeria, “Our present leaders who have led us for more than 20 years, which legacy have they left for our children, for refusing to pay our entitlement after putting in several years of service.” He then called on the owners of all closed textile industries to pay textile workers their entitlement which is long overdue and pledged that textiles workers will use their Permanent Voters Cards (PVC) to vote for leaders that have the interest of textile workers at heart in the 2023 general elections
