Following the allegation that the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is stalling the linkage of Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway to the port, the Apapa Area Command has clarified that there is a fresh arrangement now in place which clarified the rail line route which is quite different from the previous one. The China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC) had last week said the customs had refused to relocate its building around the APM terminal which has stalled the final connection of the track to the port quay.

The scanner which belongs to the customs has been removed while it is the responsibility of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to move the over-time containers to the terminal at Ikorodu. “The movement also requires a huge cost to move them,” he said.
