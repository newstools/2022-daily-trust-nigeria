 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has again rescheduled its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting earlier slated for Tuesday. The meeting which is expected to fine-tune the opposition party’s preparations ahead of next year’s general elections will now take place on Wednesday, May 11, 2022. Senator Samuel N. Anyanwu, the National Secretary of the party, in a statement yesterday said the earlier date “clashes with the local government delegate election involving all members of our party,” adding that “all inconveniences are regretted.” Top among the issues expected to be discussed by the NEC is the vexed issue of zoning threatening the existence of the party. The party’s 37-member committee on zoning headed by the Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom had submitted its report to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party led by Dr Iyorchia Ayu, but NEC is expected to make the final decision on the zoning impasse. Another issue awaiting the NEC decision is the mode of primaries to be adopted in choosing who flies the flag of the party.
