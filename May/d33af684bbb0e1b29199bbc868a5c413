An advocacy organisation, Danikal Public Speaking Academy, has called on the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Bello, to introduce a policy that will end violence in schools and homes. Ms Ikalone Udo, the founder of the organisation, who made the call at “Speakout Initiative for Children and Women” organised at Funtaj International School in Abuja, said there was the need to provide a platform for children and women to speak out against various forms of social vices. Ms Udo said the call was necessary because the rate of bullying in schools, homes, rape cases, and sexual molestation leading to death, as well as kidnapping cases, had been on the rise. She said the victims who were mostly children between the ages of 0 and 17 were supposed to be protected by parents, caregivers and the society at large, adding that on the contrary, children were being bullied in schools, raped at home, schools and kidnapped. She explained that, “From the case of Sylvester Oromoni, an 11-year-old student of Bowen College, whose news broke the internet that he was bullied by some set of seniors, to another case of Karen of Premiere Academy, Abuja, who till date is alleged to have died because of the infection caused by a condom found in her. There has been no conviction nor detailed reason for her death.”
