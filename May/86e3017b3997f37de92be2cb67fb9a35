A former Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mike Okiro, has revealed how some politicians “swindled” him and collected all his savings when he contested senatorial election. He said some group of persons tricked him to join politics after his retirement and gradually collected his money till he was left with nothing. Okiro spoke in Abuja at a programme tagged ‘Presidential aspirants’ media interactive platform’ organised by New Nigeria Dream Initiative (NNDI). He said: “Nigerians will talk about the leadership deficiency, but I say no, that is not enough. It takes two angles. If leaders have deficiency, we have followers’ complacency. “I contested election in Abuja here; Senate. I was on my own when they called me to come and contest. I said I have just retired, they said no, come and contest. “So, they would come to me and say we want to go here, bring money; we want to do this, bring money; we want to do that, bring money. I gave all my savings, nothing again to give. They came one day, I said I was not going to give more money because I have nothing to give.”
