Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State has refuted media reports which quoted him as dropping his presidential aspiration for a former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. Badaru had on Wednesday said he would not contest in the presidential primary of the party with Amaechi because both of them were “children of President Muhammadu Buhari”. Speaking with journalists yesterday in Dutse, the governor insisted that he was still in the presidential race, saying that he picked the APC presidential forms because he believed he had what it took to lead the country. Badaru said, “Amaechi and I are APC family members. We also belong to the Muhammad Buhari school of thought. Amaechi and I joined hands with others for APC’s success in both 2015 and 2019. “So, if our father, Muhammadu Buhari, asks me to step down for Amaechi, I will not hesitate to do so. Equally, I believe if he asks him to step down for me, he would do so.”
