By Daniel Dada A sensitisation road show from Kubwa to Gwarinpa in Abuja to create awareness on safety in the workplace was on Thursday held by the National Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) to celebrate the World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2022. Mrs Nwosu Oby, Principal Manager, Health Safety and Environment Head at NSITF, Kagini branch, at the event where fliers were distributed, said the theme for this year was: “Let’s Act Together to Build a Positive, Safe and Health Culture”. She said NSITF was mandated by government to implement the Employee Compensation Scheme which involved the prevention of accidents, occupational injury and disease at the workplace; both public and private. She explained that safety was being conscious of “our environment, and this means increase in productivity, increase in revenue, hence better staff welfare.” She said the scheme, which renders free occupational safety and health awareness in all workplaces, was financed by contribution made by employers and employees through one  per cent of their monthly emoluments. She noted that compensation would also be paid to affected employees or their next of kin according to the provisions of the Employees Compensation Act of the NSITF which “will wipe away tears and make life better and more meaningful for them”.
