The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) can earn over $6.993 million (N2.906 billion) as a foreign exchange from processing 24 applications and licensing fees for petroleum drilling and production companies if the schemes are well harnessed. Nigeria is currently facing issues with forex with the dollar exchanging for N415 at the official window and over N600 at the parallel market. However, according to a licence and fee schedule, NUPRC which took over from the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) six months ago can earn forex for the country. About 14 of them are payable to the ‘Accountant General FGN’ with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through JP Morgan Chase Bank in New York, United States. Seven payments go to the ‘Miscellaneous Oil Revenue’ and three into the ‘Concession Rentals’ account.
