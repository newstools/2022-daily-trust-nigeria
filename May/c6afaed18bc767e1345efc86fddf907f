 The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has assured that the planned removal of shop attachments at Karu village in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) will not affect indigenous houses. Mr Ikharo Attah, Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, gave the assurance at a meeting with the leadership of Karu Gbagyi Development Association (KGDA) on Friday. Attah explained that the objective of the demolition was to shift some shop attachments and other illegal structures under high tension cables and close to road shoulders a little bit back. Attah who noted that the FCTA was a partner with the indigenous people and communities, said, “We are grateful that all indigenous communities have given us enough cooperation to build this city, and we must be eternally grateful. “And we are not mindful of the fact that we should treat the indigenes very specially, not because other Nigerians are not special, but because of the fact that we met them at the point of exit from Lagos to Abuja; that gives them very special privilege among the leagues of other ethnic nationalities and communities within the FCT.” Earlier, Chief Yunana Bawa, Sarkin Yaki (Bhazhe), Karu, Abuja, commended the FCTA for initiating the idea to sanitise the area of illegal shops and attachments. He said, “We are very happy the way you have accepted and cooperated with us. We have some basic places that we must go and there are other ancestors’ places that we will look at all together.”
