 The authorities of the Prince Abubakar Audu University (PAU), Anyigba, in Kogi State, has warned against cultism, rape, extortion and other social vices as it matriculated 6,470 students for the 2021/2022 academic session. Speaking during the 23rd matriculation ceremony of the institution at the weekend, the Vice Chancellor (VC) of the university, Professor Marietu Ohunene Tenuche, said they had zero tolerance for the vices. She told the matriculating students to, in their own interest, keep off all forms of social vices that would bring ridicule to the name of the university, state and their parents. She said, “Cultism, rape, extortion of money from students using class representatives, indecent dressing, among others, are vices that have no place in the new university that we are building. As an administration, we have zero tolerance for these vices.” The VC disclosed that nine programmes in the faculty of education had been fully accredited, while noting that all courses offered in the university were duly accredited. She commended Governor Yahaya Bello for the support and love of the university, which according to her, made all the achievements possible.
