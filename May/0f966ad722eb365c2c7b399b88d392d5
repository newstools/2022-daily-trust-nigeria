Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has promised the 7’000 delegates from Niger State free hotel accommodation and feeding during the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary in Abuja. Special Assistant to the VP, Babafemi Ojudu, announced this yesterday in Minna, Niger State, before his principal was led by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to a hall in the Government House where Osinbajo interacted with the delegates. He asked journalists to step out, saying his boss would not be able to respond candidly to some questions that would be asked by the delegates if journalists were present. Addressing the delegates, he said: “I want to inform you that coming to Abuja, you have no fear of any kind. Those of us who are his friends and associates have made hotel accommodation available for you. Before you leave here, we will let you know the hotel in which you are going to stay. “Your feeding in the hotel will be done by us. Then there will be buses in the hotel to take you from the hotel to the venue of the conference. We are going to have a desk in the hotel that is going to take care of your needs. “Like I said, he wants to partner with you; he won’t let you suffer. We want you to come to Abuja and carry out this assignment and also enjoy yourself.” He also said the vice president would be in each of the hotels where the delegates will be accommodated to talk to them and canvass for their votes. There were insinuations that account numbers of the delegates were compiled by a group assigned by Osinbajo’s campaign team before his arrival. But our correspondent could not establish how much was to be given to each of the delegates.
