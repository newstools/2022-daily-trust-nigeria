Operatives of the EFCC had earlier surrounded the APC Presidential aspirant’s private residence in the capital city, Abuja. The mission of the operatives couldn’t be immediately ascertained but the lawmaker while addressing journalists said he wondered why the security agents would hold him hostage and prevent him from participating in the screening of all presidential aspirants. But reacting to the siege, the EFCC, in a statement by its spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said the move followed the alleged refusal of the former governor to honour several invitations extended to him after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the commission. Uwujaren recalled that the EFCC had on January 24, 2022, filed a 17-count charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9billion against Okorocha. He said the case was assigned to Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Okorocha was twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes. Wilson added, ”At the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, had warned that it was ‘the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter.’ ”In the circumstances, the Commission is left with no option but to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.”
