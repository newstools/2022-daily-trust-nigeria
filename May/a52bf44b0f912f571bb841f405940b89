House of Representatives member, Shina Peller whose Presidential campaign posters flooded some parts of Nigeria, says he cannot go into the race. The lawmaker currently representing lseyin/ltesiwaju/ Kajola/lwajowa at the lower legislative chamber of the National Assembly, rather declared intention to represent Oyo North Senatorial district. He stated that contesting the Presidency is tantamount to leading the youth into war, saying he was not ready to do that. “I will not lead our youths into a war that we cannot win. Our party will most likely make use of indirect poll, which means the elections will be at the mercy of the delegates. How many of the delegates believe in the leadership of the youths,” he said at an event organised by the Coalition of Progressive Nigerian Youth in Lagos. The lawmaker said he was under pressure to contest for presidency but he was rejecting the call because the current political structure in the All Progressives Congress (APC) which he belongs does not favour his emergence. He said, “People have been clamouring for me to run for the highest office in the country, while some have said I should run for a seat in the senate. “These posts are elevated. I say thank you to the people who find me worthy of these positions. “These clamours have created mixed reactions because in Nigeria, we don’t think about people but only about ourselves. The reason I have come into politics is to help the people, not for my own benefit. “But as great leaders, you will be forced to take risks, make sacrifices and also do things that will benefit the people. “On that note, I declare my intention to run for a seat at the senate representing Oyo north senatorial district.” The lawmaker also charged the youths to run for legislative positions across board.
