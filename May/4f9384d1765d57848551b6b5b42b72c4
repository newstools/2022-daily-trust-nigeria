A former governor of Anambra State and PDP presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, has urged the party’s delegates to accept aspirants’ money but should not allow the financial inducement influence their voting decision at the primaries. Speaking while addressing the party’s delegate in Kaduna yesterday, Obi said if he gets elected, he would transform Nigeria from a consumption to a production country. “I’m begging you; try to build a better future for your children. If you take that money, do not allow that money to influence your voting. When people give you money, take it,” he said.
