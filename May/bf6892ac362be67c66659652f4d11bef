The All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in Bayelsa State have commenced moves to reconcile the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva; a former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri; and the party’s 2019 governorship candidate, Chief David Lyon. The trio were said to have engaged in a struggle for the structure of the party in the state which was factionalised following a Supreme Court judgement annulling Lyon’s victory at the 2019 governorship election. APC leaders said the reconciliation was to ensure the party’s success at the 2023 elections. Briefing newsmen yesterday in Yenagoa, Pastor Reuben Wilson, a chieftain of the party, said the reconciliatory effort would return APC to “winning ways”. He said the party in Bayelsa suffered setbacks after the apex court’s judgement as members lost interest to push further. According to him, the party will leverage on the massive goodwill it enjoys which resulted in a landslide victory in the last general elections to woo the electorate. He said, “Once we get this reconciliation effort concluded, we shall bounce back to our winning streak and regain the mandate of Bayelsa people, because in APC, we have the people to drive the holistic development of Bayelsa.” He further said the feedback from the reconciliatory move was very encouraging as all the major blocs within the party had shown commitment to peace and unity in Bayelsa APC.
