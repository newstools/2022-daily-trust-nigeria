A female senatorial candidate on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mrs Adedayo Benjamin-Laniyi, has said affirmative action is not an agenda for women alone. She stated this in Abuja while addressing newsmen at a meeting with the party delegates ahead of primary elections tomorrow. Mrs Laniyi said the affirmative action is also a platform to unify women and develop the country’s political process. She promised to champion legislation that will translate the socio-economic deficits into socio-economic surplus to address the needs of the people.
