The emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the PDP presidential flagbearer is a quit notice to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Muhammadu Abdullahi Sugar, an associate of the former vice president, has said. Speaking with Daily Trust Monday, Sugar expressed optimism that Atiku would defeat the candidates of APC and other parties in the presidential poll next year. He said the Nigerian masses had been betrayed by the APC and Buhari. “Nigerians are disappointed, especially the masses who had faith in Buhari and spent their own resources with the hope that he would salvage their situation.”
