 The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), on Saturday, unveiled a plan to unbundle the e-call up system introduced to end the gridlock on access roads to Apapa Port Complex. NPA had on February 27, 2021, introduced the electronic call-up system for trucks at the ports in Lagos to end the gridlock witnessed on the road. The e-call-up system was launched alongside an app called Eto, which truckers are expected to use to book turns to enter the port. Recalled that truckers under the aegis of the Council of Maritime Transport Union and Association (COMTUA) had called for the unbundling of the electronic call-up system over persistent extortion along the port’s access roads. Addressing issues around the e-call-up system, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mr Mohammed Bello-koko, said there are plans to introduce another app to serve as a competitor for the current system. “Why we are having collaboration with the Lagos State government and the police commands to checkmate the menace of illegal checkpoints. I have said that we are likely going to create a second app because we want to establish competition and give people alternatives aside Eto,” the MD stated.
