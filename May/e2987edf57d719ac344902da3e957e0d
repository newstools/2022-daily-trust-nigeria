The Rivers State Governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful,  Nyesom Wike, said it is time for the party to reward his efforts in rescuing the party from the brink. The reward, he said, was to vote him as the party’s presidential flagbearer for the 2023 general elections. Wike stated this yesterday in Birnin Kebbi while addressing PDP delegates ahead of the party’s presidential primary election. He said his doggedness in stabilising the party at the time of crisis gave him an edge over other aspirants.
