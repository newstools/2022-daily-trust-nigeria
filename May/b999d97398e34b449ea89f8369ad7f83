Pastor Tunde Bakare has opened up on why he was absent from a meeting with Osinbajo, Tinubu and others at the weekend in Lagos. Bakare made the disclosure during an interview on Channels TV on Monday. On Saturday All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders met with presidential, gubernatorial and National Assembly aspirants from the zone, during which it was resolved that ‘every aspirant has a right to contest the 2023 elections.’ Bakare said, “I was invited a day or two before the event, but I gave a tangible excuse that I would not be there. Previously I scheduled to meet the president and the Commander-in-Chief on that exact day, 6th of May at 9pm and the meeting in Lagos was 6pm. “It’s Adebayo who contacted me on behalf of the group, telling me that the meeting had been fixed and that I was being invited. And I sent the message to him, which he delivered there. It’s not possible for me to be in two places at the same time and I spoke with those who convened the meeting. He told me the excuse was tendered there and was accepted.”
