Kano State Deputy Governor, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, has said Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje nominated him for a ministerial position in 2018. Ganduje and some party leaders recently endorsed Gawuna for the APC governorship ticket in Kano. The governor, who said he endorsed his deputy to succeed him in 2023 because of his loyalty, presented the party’s governorship nomination forms to Gawuna at the Kano government house during a stakeholders’ meeting yesterday. Speaking at the meeting, Gawuna said his principal nominated him as his running mate in 2019 after failing to secure the ministerial appointment. He said, “People don’t know why I was the only one he (Ganduje) retained out of 19 members of the State Executive Council (SEC) from the previous administration. “In 2018, President Buhari requested Ganduje to forward nomination for a ministerial appointment, and he forwarded my name. I passed the screening but the appointment was not made. “The same year, 2018, he called and told me he was nominating me to be his deputy because he felt comfortable we would work and develop Kano State together.”
