A former governor of Anambra State and ex-presidential aspirant of the Peoples DemocraticParty, Peter Obi, has said that he would rather lose doing the right thing than win doing the wrong thing. Obi made the observation when he appeared on Channel TV’s Politics Today on Friday. Obi dumped the PDP and joined Labour Party on Friday. He said, “I’m not desperate to be president; I’m desperate to see Nigeria work especially for the youth. I’ve moved to a party where I think the system will allow me to contribute. “I’ll rather lose doing the right thing than win doing the wrong thing. My politics has been consistent in character and integrity throughout the time I started. You can go and check. “This is not the first time I left PDP. In 2002 when I started this politics I was a member of PDP. I went to one meeting and I want to contribute and some people said no you cannot contribute. “I quietly left and went to APGA. I went to APGA, campaigned and won election and somebody else was declared. I didn’t quarrel and I went to court. I became the first Nigerian to ever stayed in court for three years and I didn’t quarrel until I was declared winner.” Peter Obi debunked the claim that he visited the presidential candidate of the New Nigerian People’s Party (NNPP) Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, before he dumped PDP, adding that the NNPP was never a choice for him.
