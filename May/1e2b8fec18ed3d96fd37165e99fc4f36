The Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media and Digital Communications, Bashir Ahmad has mocked supporters of the former president, Goodluck Jonathan, over claims of defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a tweet on Thursday, the media aide trolled the ex-president’s supporters for “insulting” him when he shared the news of Jonathan’s defection to the ruling party. He wrote, “When I shared the news of former President Jonathan joining our party, his uninformed supporters insulted me saying that can never happen even in the wildest dream. They should know that we know something they don’t know and not everything is planned and executed on social media”[sic]. There have been rumours about Jonathan’s defection to the APC since Monday when a northern group announced to have bought the APC Presidential forms for him, which his media team later released a statement debunking the claims and described it as “an insult.” However, on Wednesday he was reported to have joined the APC by registering at his Otuoke Ward, in Bayelsa State, and has accepted the APC presidential forms bought for him by the northern group. Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dennis Otiotio, has said that the former President is officially not yet a member of the APC in the state.
