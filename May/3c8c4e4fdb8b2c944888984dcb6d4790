The Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, on Saturday, launched the mobile Meters Access Providers (MAP) where customers can access the meters toward ending disputation over estimated billing. The DisCo launched the meters in conjunction with Mojec Company. Speaking at the launching of the new system in Jos, the Managing Director, Alhaji Mammanlafia Umar, called on customers desiring meters to take advantage of the current metering programme, adding that the exercise was running concurrently in Bauchi, Benue and Gombe states. Umar, who was represented at the event by the Chief Commercial, Engr Mansir Nakande, disclosed that the cost of the meters would be amortised, as the company was working towards metering all its customers. “All our customers without meters are insisting that they are being overcharged. We cannot say with certainty that customers are right or wrong. There are a lot of challenges with estimation,” he said. He further explained that “There are also challenges of liquidity because we need a lot of money to buy meters which is why the Meter Assets Providers (MAP) was introduced for the customers to buy meters stressing that the company will refund the customers with energy.
