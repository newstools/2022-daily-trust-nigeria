A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant and Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, has expressed pleasure with the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari not to sign the latest amendment to the Electoral Act 2022. The National Assembly amended Section 84 (8) of the act to allow statutory delegates to vote in political party primaries. Mohammed said he was comfortable with the existing act which he noted had reduced the number of delegates to woo for votes, stressing that “the less the merrier”. He spoke Wednesday while fielding questions from state house reporters after leading a delegation on a thank-you-visit to the president for inaugurating a N23.5bn World Bank-assisted upgraded Bauchi Township Water Supply Scheme. According to him, the process of amending the electoral act did not start on time and assenting to the bill now might go against the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) guidelines for elections. He said, “I think, the less the merrier, as somebody who is in the race. Well, I have less delegates to go and woo, it is better for me than all these 4,000, 5,000 delegates. Anyway, that is my take.” Asked about his chances at the PDP presidential primary, Mohammed, said, “My chances are very high, as well as the chances of others. So, the choice is for Nigerians to make. And I don’t want to be pre-emptive or presumptuous about it. But certainly, I have a very good chance. And if I get the chance, I believe you should see it as your own chance because I represent you in this journey and leadership.”
