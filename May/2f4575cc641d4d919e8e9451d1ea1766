The federal government is doing remedial dredging of the Escravos channel in Delta State to open up the eastern port, said the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). According to a statement, the Managing Director of NPA, Mohammed Bello-Koko, who stated this in Warri, Delta State, said the dredging of the channel would boost the cargo volume to both Warri and Calabar Ports. The dredging which he said is about halfway done, will enable the port in Delta State to have a better draft, receive bigger vessels and record less incidents of vessels running aground when completed. “We all know that the breakwaters collapsed about 10 years ago, and there has been high siltation resulting in a reduction of the draft from seven meters to three meters in some places,” Bello-Koko said. He also said the mapping and charting of the Escravos channel starting from the fairway buoy down to Koko Port, which has not been done for over a decade or more, has commenced. “We have a special interest in ensuring that Warri and other ports are more active,” he noted, saying the agency was holding more consultations. The NPA team visited the Olu of Warri Kingdom, Ogiame Atuwatse III, to seek support in reviving the Warri Port. The monarch said he was satisfied with the visit of the NPA management to the Warri Port as the first port of call after Bello-Koko’s confirmation as the managing director.
