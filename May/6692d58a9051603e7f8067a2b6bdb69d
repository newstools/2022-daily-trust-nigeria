The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirants in Abia State have urged the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) not to accept any list of delegates from the state. Briefing newsmen in Abuja yesterday, the aspirants led by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, said the call has become imperative as no ward congress to elect the 3-man ad hoc delegates took place in the state. Abaribe, flanked by other governorship aspirants, called on the NWC to use only statutory delegates for the forthcoming primaries to avoid a looming disaster for all the aspirants at all levels in Abia State.
