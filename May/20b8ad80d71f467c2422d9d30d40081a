The Chairman of Kuje Area Council of the FCT, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, has expressed displeasure over the dumping of refuse on in drains by residents. Sabo, who spoke after he inspected some blocked drains at Anguwar Kayarada in the metropolis after a heavy downpour on Saturday, warned that any resident caught dumping in drains would face the wrath of the law.

He said despite public enlightenment campaign being carried out by the government, some residents still dumped refuse indiscriminately.
