The Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, has denied endorsing the presidential ambition of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. An online news platform had reported that the emir threw his weight behind the presidential bid of Osinbajo when he visited the monarch in Bauchi. But the emirate debunked the story in a statement yesterday by its Information Officer, Babangida Hassan Jahun. Jahun described the news as fake and urged the public to disregard it. The statement quoted the emir’s remarks at the meeting as; “I want to welcome you to Bauchi State. I believe you are in Bauchi for political activities but you still considered it necessary to visit me at this material time. This shows the love and respect you have for the traditional institution. “We believe that power belongs to Allah and he gives it to whoever he wants. By virtue of our position, we are not politicians, we can’t participate in politics but we only advise wisely. “We pray that whatever you are here to do today in Bauchi State is fruitful. Whatever will bring unity and peace in our country is what we are after.”
