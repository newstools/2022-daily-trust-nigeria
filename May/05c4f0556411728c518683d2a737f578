The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has directed Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to commence data recapture exercises for retirement savings account holders managed by them. In a statement released in Abuja on Thursday,  the Commission said the exercise was for both active contributors and retirees whose data have not been recaptured. “The data recapture exercise (DRE) is in compliance with the directive of the federal government that all data generating organisations should harmonise their databases with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) as it is consistent with the need to have a credible database of all RSA holders in Nigeria,” the statement said. According to PenCom, retirees who are either on programmed withdrawal or annuity, are expected to present their national driver’s license or any one of the following: PVC; or international passport (mandatory for non-Nigerians) of enrolment slip issued by NIMC or a letter of retirement issued by the employer to the retiree. The commission also asked PFAs to issue acknowledgement slips to RSA holders who have duly complied. PenCom added that two agents, Payone Solution Systems Limited and Afritech Multi-Concept Limited, have been engaged by PFAs to carry out the exercise.
