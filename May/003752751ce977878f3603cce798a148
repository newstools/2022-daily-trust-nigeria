A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant and former Senate President, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has said that it is the turn of the North Central to produce the next president. Speaking during a consultative meeting with the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) PDP delegates in Abuja, Saraki also promised to facilitate adequate compensation plan for indigenes of the FCT. He said, “This ticket is not only my ticket, it is our ticket, all of us shall benefit from it. And that is why the whole 41 delegates here, not one should go anywhere because this is your own. “Nobody leaves his own to go and take somebody else’s own. We will tell them in the past North Central had worked for other people, it’s time for them now to work for us. After they have worked for us this time, then we can talk about working for them again. This is for us. It is not for just me, it is for all of us.”
