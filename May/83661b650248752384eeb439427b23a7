The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State has suspended its chairman, Colonel Bala Mande (rtd.) over alleged anti-party activities. The party’s Publicity Secretary, Abba Bello, in a statement, alleged that Mande had been conducting the party’s affairs without the involvement of the State Working Committee in flagrant violation of its constitution. He said the suspension of the party chairman in the state was to forestall the abuse of power and the derailment of the rules governing the party. He said the suspension is for a period of one month, during which the vice chairman, Kaura Namoda zone, Mallam Ali Namoda, would oversee the activities of the party. He also said the State Working Committee has constituted a panel to probe the allegation against the chairman.
