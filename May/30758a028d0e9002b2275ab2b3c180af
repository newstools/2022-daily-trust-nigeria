The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that there was a fire incident in its Local Government Area Office in Kauran Namoda, Zamfara State. National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said on Tuesday in Abuja, that the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for Zamfara State, Prof. Sa’idu Babura Ahmed, reported the incident to the commission. Okoye said the incident occurred around 11.00pm on May 2, 2022. He said no casualties were reported while critical materials like Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) and registration machines for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise stored in fireproof cabinets were saved. “However, the building was extensively damaged. Some fixed and movable office furniture was destroyed in spite of the best effort of the Zamfara State Fire Service and the spirited efforts of good Samaritans to contain the inferno. “The attention of the Nigeria Police has been drawn to this incident. Together with the Fire Service, they have commenced investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire and advise the commission for further action,” Okoye said.
