Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule’s second term bid received a boost after his supporters paid N50m to pick forms for him to contest the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket. Special Adviser to the governor on Special Duties, Murtala Lamus, who led his principal’s supporters to pick the forms, said even though Sule was yet to make any official declaration on his second ambition, their decision was to compel him to seek re-election. He said: “The governor has performed beyond expectations and as such deserves the support of all and sundry to enable him to continue with the good works he is doing for the overall development of the state.” Meanwhile, a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia, has joined the 2023 Benue State governorship race on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Catholic priest during a meeting weekend in Abuja urged the party and the people of the state to support his aspiration for rapid development and wellbeing of the people. Rev. Alia also rolled out his seven-point agenda, which includes enhancing education and healthcare and tackling corruption and other malpractices.
