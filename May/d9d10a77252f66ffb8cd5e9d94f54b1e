Swiss luxury watchmaker IWC said it has partnered with PoloLuxury, a Nigerian watch retailer to unveil its products in the local market. In a statement issued in Lagos yesterday, the company said the partnership is meant to bring the Swiss watchmaker to a booming watch market in Nigeria. With IWC’s entry into the market, timepiece collectors are granted access to the 154-year legacy of watch-making innovation with products like the Portugieser, the Pilot Watch, and the Da Vinci. PoloLuxury is the official retailer for some of the most prestigious Swiss watch brands in the world, which include Rolex, Cartier, Piaget, Chopard, Longines, and IWC, among others. Polo said with this track record, IWC decided to bring its products closer to its Nigerian customers, the statement noted.
