The Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service (FCT-IRS) says it has introduced Electronic Tax Clearance Certificate (E-TCC) to improve service delivery and checkmate activities of fraudsters who could forge such documents. The acting Executive Chairman of the service, Mr Haruna Abdullahi, disclosed this during his engagement with the members of the House Committee on Public Accounts at the National Assembly on Monday in Abuja. I won’t retire from politics until I achieve my ambition – Tinubu 20 INEC commissioners to go in June, August Abdullahi explained that the E-TCC had fortified the process thereby making it difficult for anyone to forge such document because of the introduction of the QR CODE. He said this effort would help the service not to be short-changed, as well as boost revenue for the FCT. The acting executive chairman stated that Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) was a document issued by the tax authority to certify that an individual or a business was compliant with the appropriate requirements as stated by law within a stipulated period; usually for the three preceding years. The chairman advised that taxpayers should always endeavour to declare their incomes accordingly with evidence that would be satisfactory to the managers of the tax authority. In his remarks, the Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Mr Oluwole Oke, urged the general public or taxpayers to report any violation of the law concerning issuance of TCC to the management of FCT-IRS.
