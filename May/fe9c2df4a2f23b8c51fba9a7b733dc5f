The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has tasked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari to be accountable to Nigerians following the myriad of problems in the country. The party said as it celebrated with Nigerians, especially the Muslim Ummah on Eid el-Fitr which marked the successful completion of the month-long Ramadan fast, it was worried that many faithful could not travel for fear of being kidnapped. In a statement by Hon Debo Ologunagba, National Publicity Secretary of the party, PDP urged Nigerians to use the occasion to “strengthen the bond of unity and rekindle the virtues of love, faith in God, forgiveness, patience, tolerance, humility, compassion, care for one another, as well as our commitment to the survival and development of our dear nation.” The PDP further said, “Our party is deeply saddened that millions of Nigerian families are observing the Eid el-Fitr in despondency, anguish, sorrow and misery due to poverty and economic hardship foisted on them by the misrule of the APC. “It is also distressing that most Nigerians could not travel as they did in the past to celebrate with their loved ones due to insecurity, as the APC government continues to keep mute, turn blind eyes and refuse to confront terrorists who are daily ravaging our compatriots in communities, highways, railways and even worship places. “The PDP, in very strong terms, tasks President Muhammadu Buhari on the divisiveness, corruption, arrogance in failure, recklessness, impunity, lack of transparency, violation of rules and lethargic approach of his administration which are responsible for the social, economic and security quandary in our nation under the APC administration.”
