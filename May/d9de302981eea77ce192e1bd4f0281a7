One of the leading toilet cleaning brands in Nigeria, Harpic manufactured by Reckitt has introduced a pocket-friendly sachet as part of efforts to revolutionize toilet hygiene. This was disclosed at the launch an Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign by Harpic in collaboration with Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources. The new pack which cost as low as N30 is designed to enable the mass-market consumers who could not afford the bigger packs to experience the premium quality of Harpic, thus, bridging the access gap to toilet hygiene in the country. Commenting on the partnership, the Marketing Director, Reckitt Sub-Sahara Africa, Tanzim Rezwan said  the purpose is to protect, heal and nurture a cleaner and healthier world. According to him, poor hygiene and sanitation are linked to the transmission of diseases, which is why Harpic has reached almost 90million people globally through educational communications around health and hygiene. In his keynote address at the launch, the Lagos State Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello commended the long-standing relationship between Reckitt, and Lagos State Government through the Ministry on various environmental initiatives and projects with special focus on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH).
