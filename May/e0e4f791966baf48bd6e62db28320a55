 Fidelity Bank has partnered with the Al-Muhibbah Foundation (AMF) to provide relief materials to the less privileged across the 20 local government areas in Bauchi State. The bank said the gesture, which was held at the Bauchi State Government House, was part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The Regional Bank Head, North-East, Fidelity Bank Plc, Musa Tarimbuka, appreciated the Foundation for the opportunity to partner with them and explained that the donation was made under the Fidelity Helping Hands Programme (FHHP). He said: “Fidelity Bank is a full-fledged commercial bank operating in Nigeria with over 6.5 million customers serviced across its 250 business offices and digital banking channels. “With the FHHP, staff across our business locations identify projects that impact their immediate community and raise funds to execute them. The bank’s management thereafter matches this contribution with an equal amount and disburses it for the selected project. The food and clothing items we are donating today were therefore part-procured by Fidelity Bank staff working in Bauchi State in support of their host communities”, explained Tarimbuka. The First Lady, Hajiya Aisha Bala Muhammed, said the annual Sallah presentation is part of her initiative to support the less privileged, orphans, vulnerable children and women during festive periods.
