The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) in Plateau State under its Special Public Works Department (SPW) has commenced training of 30 unemployed youths on Enviropreneurship Development Scheme (EDS). Speaking during the opening ceremony, the state’s Coordinator of NDE, on Friday, Mallam Ibrahim Hardo Abdulazeez, said the objective of the scheme was to reduce unemployment among youths. He said the scheme would provide them with on-the-job training, entrepreneurship skills training and the use of waste materials to develop several products and services that brought about sustainable business. The coordinator, therefore, urged the participants to use the three-month training judiciously, adding that many unemployed people were looking for such opportunity. In her goodwill message, the Head of Rural Employment Promotion (REP) of NDE, Mrs Asabe Lassa, advised the participants to be serious and put in their best, saying that the EDS was a very good scheme that would curb unemployment on the Plateau.
