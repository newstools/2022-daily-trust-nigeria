The federal government said it will provide work tools and other resources for housing loans to 118 graduates of its Leadership Enhancement and Development Programme (Lead-P). The Head of the Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, gave the assurance on Tuesday in Abuja at the graduation ceremony of the Lead-P beneficiaries. Yemi-Esan said that the Lead-P training had a goal of cultivating 100 officers on salary Grade Levels 10 to 14 annually, meant to produce the next generation of leaders in the Federal Civil Service. She also said that her office has commenced arrangements to ensure that each of the 118 beneficiaries gets laptops to enhance their work. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, commended Yemi-Esan for her laudable initiative, saying lack of leadership development for effective succession planning had, over time, remained the bane of the civil service.
