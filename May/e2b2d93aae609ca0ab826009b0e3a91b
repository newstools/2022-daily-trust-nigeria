The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has urged youth-led groups across the country to collapse their nationwide structure into the party. The party’s National Chairman, Shehu Gaban, stated this during a merger with the Youth Democratic Party of Nigeria (YDPN) in Abuja. He said SDP would give automatic tickets to anyone who wants to contest an elective position should they accept to join the party. Chairman of YDPN, Zekeri Hashim, said the merger with SDP was necessary because young Nigerians were in need of a platform to fully be involved in politics.
