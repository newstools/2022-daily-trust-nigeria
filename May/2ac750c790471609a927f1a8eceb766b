According to him, “People-centric leadership is the cornerstone of our great party, the PRP. Our founding fathers understood this perfectly. You can’t have sustainable development that excludes the people. “My journey to this point has been long. For years, I have nursed a burden to assist in the ‘upliftment’ of the vulnerable, the downtrodden, the forgotten and the helpless. This passion for improving the socio-economic status of those ‘left behind’ by society has led me to engage in numerous projects both within and outside our dear state, Adamawa, over the past five years through the IBI Foundation.”
