The former National Vice Chairman (South-South) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hilliard Eta, has said that the former president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, is not a member of the party, and thus cannot get the ticket of the party’s presidential candidacy. While speaking on Arise TV on Monday against the backdrop of purported moves to impose Jonathan as the presidential candidate of the APC, Eta who is a supporter of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s aspiration, said the former president is not a member of the party, and that the ‘Jonathan option’ as a presidential candidate of the party was dead on arrival. Eta said, “The former president of the country, Mr Goodluck Jonathan, is not a member of our party. Those who are using his name for speculations and gossip are not members of our party, and so they can say all they may, but Goodluck Jonathan cannot be the presidential candidate of our party. I can assure you.” Also on the issue of the much deliberated consensus presidential candidate in the APC, Eta said that he doesn’t think  APC has any plans for consensus and that even Tinubu who is one of the foremost aspirants of the party’s ticket is not a supporter of consensus candidacy. “I do not think that the APC is boiled for a consensus arrangement. I am a supporter of one of the foremost, if not the only aspirant in the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and he is not interested in any consensus. “We have been working around the nation, we have been working twenty-four seven to ensure that Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu becomes the presidential candidate of the party, and we are not considering any consensus arrangement as we speak,” said Eta.
