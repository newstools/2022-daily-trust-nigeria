At least 87 All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants are jostling for 26 Osun State House of Assembly seats in the 2023 elections. The screening committee led by Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, APC former governorship candidate in Edo State, had screened the aspirants at the party secretariat in Osogbo, the state capital. Ize-Iyamu pledged that his committee would provide a level-playing field for all the aspirants. Meanwhile, the screening exercise indicated that the internal crisis in Osun APC may have subsided as aspirants who are loyal to the former governor, Rauf Aregbesola, also participated in the screening. The Aregbesola’s faction, which is known as The Osun Progressive (TOP), had rejected the process that produced the current executives of the party and stayed away from its activities. TOP members held parallel congress and set up parallel executives led by the former secretary of the party, Alhaji Rasaq Salinsile, as state chairman.
