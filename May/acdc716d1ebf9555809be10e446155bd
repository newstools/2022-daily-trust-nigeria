The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has said African leaders and their citizens must take weather forecast products seriously to mitigate the impacts of climate-related disasters on their economies in the face of vulnerabilities arising from global climate change. The Director General of NiMet, Professor Mansur Bako Matazu, made the call at the closing ceremony of the annual African Centre of Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD) board of governors meeting that was held in Abuja. ACMAD has 54 countries as members. Nigeria is the current chair of the board of governors. Speaking to journalists at the event, Prof Matazu said, “We deliberated on how to apply meteorological services in African countries, especially with the changes in climate and extreme weather events. “Key resolutions are that all African countries should bridge the gap between early warning and early actions. Early warning starts by collection of data from meteorological parametres, developing early warning products and releasing them to users who will take up the advisory for improvements in livelihoods and to mitigate disasters.” He further stated that NiMet had been providing products and services that were very critical in achieving sustainable development and mitigating impacts of weather events, thus that Nigerians should leverage the weather products for daily decisions. For instance, he said NiMet’s annual seasonal rainfall predictions and advisories were given and “we are beginning to see some of the predictions manifest already.” He, therefore, advised Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to help relay weather products across the country to users.
