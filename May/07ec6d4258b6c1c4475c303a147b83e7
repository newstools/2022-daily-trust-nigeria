It is a race between two worlds. It is a race between two styles, two convictions and two Deltans. It is a race between the old Delta that has been and the new Delta that can be. “I am enjoining Deltans to take their place with me at the starting blocks. We share the same yearnings for something new, a yearning for something transformational, something bigger than our collective imagination and yet within our potentials as a people. “Inspired by the doggedness of the founding fathers of Delta State who created a system of government that promotes inclusivity and laid the foundation for the growth that has been and is to come, we the transformational generation can dare to dream, standing on the shoulders of Chief James Onanefe Ibori, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and our infrastructure giant, Dr Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa.” He further said it was time for the new generation to take over power and deliver the expected dividends of democracy to the people, and advised Deltans to vote wisely when the time came.
