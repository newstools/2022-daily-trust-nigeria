A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and immediate past Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has said there is no need to tamper with Nigeria’s current political structure. Nwajiuba, who spoke with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, also said he would welcome the party’s decision if it decides to adopt consensus as a mode of nominating its presidential candidate for the 2023 poll. He said everything centres on good governance and not the structure, adding that he would use his blueprint to tackle the socio-economic and security challenges bedevilling the nation if elected president. “What is it that I want to restructure? The borders of Nigeria are known and are defined and accepted internationally in the world. “Restructuring obviously can’t be talking about landmarks, the issue is governance. Is it the question of landmarks or the resources? Since 1999 this Nigerian Constitution is restructured. “I ask, is there something a state does with its citizens other than service and tax? “That is how citizens and state relate. Is there anything you will like to do in Nigeria that the law says you cannot do? It’s not. If you want to build a refinery there is a process, you just need to apply.”
