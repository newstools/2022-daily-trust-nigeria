A lawyer, Max Ogah, has said that regional feeling and religious affiliation will play a major role during the presidential primaries ahead of 2023 general elections. Ogah made the observation when he appeared on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Tuesday. While the PDP is expected to conduct its primary election on May 26, the APC will hold its primary election on May 28 and 29. The lawyer alongside two other guests discussed behaviour of delegates as the APC and PDP’s primary elections approach. According to Ogah, state governors would determine who emerges presidential candidates in both political parties, as they have control over delegates. He said, “I don’t think the man from Niger will look at Yahaya Bello’s emergence as a president as something that will bring him, any benefit. We don’t divorce our politics from sentiment. I don’t think the man from Nasarawa will see a presidential ticket being dropped in Kogi as his. “So there is going to be a split. People will take position base on religion and ethnicity or tribal leanings, and all of that.” Max Ogah added that North West would also play a major role during the primary elections, as it has the largest number of delegates.
