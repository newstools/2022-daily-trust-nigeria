One of the governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, Alhaji Bashir Abubakar, has called on the national leadership of the party to intervene in what he described as a charade that took place in the form of delegates’ elections in the state. Abubakar, a retired Assistant Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), urged the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) to save it from Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s attempt to impose a candidate on others. El-Rufai has endorsed Senator Uba Sani who currently represents Kaduna Central in the senate. Speaking with journalists in Kaduna yesterday, Abubakar, through his campaign Director-General, Mr James Bawa Magaji, a former Deputy Governor of Kaduna State, said even security agencies could attest to the fact that no delegates’ election took place in the state. Also speaking, the Kaduna North Coordinator of the campaign organisation, Alhaji Hassan Saleh Jirgi, said it was appalling that El-Rufai, who had advocated power shift to the South at the national level would be seen to do the contrary in his state. However, APC Publicity Secretary in Kaduna, Salisu Tanko Wusonu, said the State Executive Committee (SEC) had unanimously agreed that delegates would be selected through consensus and urged the aggrieved members to read Article 20 of the party’s constitution.
