Lawmaker representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, has stated that his performances at the senate will speak for his reelection. Ubah made the statement on Tuesday at interactive session with the members of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Anambra State chapter in Awka, the state capital. Ubah said that his representation at the senate has touched every local government area in Anambra south senatorial District. “Never in the history of Anambra south Senatorial District did we have the representation I brought to the people. No senator has done what I have done in my first term as senator in the country, despite not in ruling party . I am the first senator that moved a motion that forced the president to sign a Bill into law outside the shore of the country ” he said. According to Ubah, despite his numerous facilitation of projects in the district, he gathered his friends to erect COVID 19 centre at Nnamdi Azikiwe Teaching Hospital, Nnewi. “Under my first term as a senator, I attracted five federal government institutions in Anambra south senatorial District and these institutions attract subventions and create jobs for the youths in the State. “I am building institutions in Anambra and it is total departure from what we used to have before now.
I am building institutions for our children and that of our unborn children in the state” he stated. He also said he created over 30,000 jobs for the youths without being a chairman or secretary of any committee in the senate as a first time senator, noting that if he becomes a ranking member he would do more. According to him, he is seeking reelection to complete all the good developmental jobs he had started in the state and the district. He also disclosed that every community in his constituency has gotten up 70 percent representation and by the end his first term they will get over 90 percent.
