 The General Manager, Courier/Logistics Regulatory Department (CLRD) of the Nigerian Postal Services (NIPOST), Mr Gideon Oludotun Shonde has clarified that the technical partnership between Transxor Technology and NIPOST will adversely affect revenue generation of licensed courier operators. Shonde gave the clarification in Lagos during a roundtable meeting between CLRD, Transxor Technologies and the licensed courier operators, organised by CLRD. According to him, there was a need to sanitise the courier and logistics industry, hence the partnership with Transxor Technology to digitise the industry and introduce digital measures to onboard independent single courier and logistics operators in the country. Some of the measures put in place by Transxor Technology, are the introduction of a digital app for courier operators and the introduction of a flexible payment plan for independent single courier and logistics operators who are mainly riders. The digital app called WEMUV, seeks to create an interactive dashboard for communication between the regulator, operators, and their customers and also to collect data of all courier and logistics operators across the country. The Co-founder and COO of Transxor Technology, Mr Ule Chimbo, said the partnership would help to address the challenges in the courier and logistics industry. “The app we introduced is to help us get the database of all courier and logistics operators in Lagos and across the country, which will help us to identify the challenges and deal with them. We are starting from a small building bloc by first identifying everybody that operates within the sector. By identifying them, we will be able to find out those that are involved in sharp practices and we will be able to address the issues,” Chimbo said.
