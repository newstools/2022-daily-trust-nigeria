The police in Benue State have arrested 20 suspects for cultism in two suburbs of Makurdi metropolis. City & Crime had three weeks ago reported escalating insecurity in Makurdi metropolis, especially the North Bank area, and the quest by residents for security agencies to clampdown on the situation. Spokesperson of the police command in the state, SP Catherine Anene, on Thursday, said the arrest of the suspects was made possible by its operatives and other sister agencies. SP Anene said, “Benue police command has embarked on a clampdown on cultism in Makurdi metropolis. In the last three week officers were deployed to North Bank and Wurukum areas precisely. “The efforts of these officers in collaboration with other security agencies, as well as members of the community, restored peace in places that were earlier affected.” She further said that while the command was working tirelessly to fight the menace of cultism, parents, teachers, traditional and religious leaders were advised to join the fight against the social vice that was destroying young people.
