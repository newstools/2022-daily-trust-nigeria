Kano State’s immediate past Commissioner for Planning and Budget, Nura Dankadai, has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He announced his decision in a letter addressed to the Ward Chairman of Tsohon Gari in Tudun Wada LGA. Dankadai and other commissioners had in April resigned from their positions to contest various elective positions in line with the directive of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. He has indicated interest to contest for the Tudun Wada/Doguwa Federal Constituency seat. Although he has not officially announced his next direction, there are insinuations that he may defect to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) led by a former Kano Governor, Rabi’u Kwankwaso.
