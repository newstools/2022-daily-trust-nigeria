A meeting which ended in the early hours of Saturday among key leaders of PDP from the North failed to broker a consensus deal. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Governors Aminu Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed declined to burge to the elders’ request to step down and endorse one of them. Only ex-bank chief Mohammed Hayatu-Deen agreed to withdraw. Party last leaders are said to be making frantic efforts for the key aspirants to put forward a united front in the face of imminent possibility of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers clinching the ticket. “A lot of them don’t believe Wike can win the general election but as it is it is almost clear that he can coast to victory if the northern candidates didn’t close their ranks,” said a source familiar with the late night meeting. Meanwhile, delegates and party officials have started trooping in to the MKO Abiola Stadium, venue of the Presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The posters of some of the main contenders Tambuwal, Mohammed, Saraki are competing for space at the venue. Even though he has withdrawn from the race, the campaign posters of ex-investment banker Muhammed Hayatu-Deen is also visible around the arena. Daily Trust also gathered that the convention proper is billed for 4pm even though there had not been any official information to that effect. The aspirants are also said to be engaged in last minute horse trading and consultation with other aspirants and delegates with hope that the pendulum will swing their way.
