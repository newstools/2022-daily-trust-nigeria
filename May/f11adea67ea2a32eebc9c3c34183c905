A frontline Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has withdrawn from the race for the party’s ticket three days to the national convention. Obi also resigned his membership of the PDP, citing acts that are not consistent with tenets of democracy. He announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the National Chairman of PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu. Obi had gone round the country to seek the support of delegates for his presidential bid, but pulled out less than 72 hours to the contest. Meanwhile, Daily Trust gathered that Obi and his associates are planning to move to either Labour Party (LP) or the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), where he hopes to actualise his presidential ambition. In the letter titled: “Resignation From Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Withdrawal from the Presidential Contest”, Obi said, “It has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions. “Our national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs. “Consequently, I’m by this letter informing you of my withdrawal from the PDP presidential primary.” Addressing journalists at the PDP headquarters in Abuja after submitting Obi’s resignation letter, Dr Doyin Okupe, Director General, Peter Obi Campaign Organisation, confirmed that his principal was moving to another party and urged Nigerians not to give up as the former governor would be on the ballot for the 2023 presidential poll.
