The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has adjusted its timetable for presidential, governorship, senatorial, House of Representatives and state assembly primaries. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Barr Felix Morka, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja that the presidential primaries earlier slated for May 30, 31 and June 1, would now be held on May 29 and 30, 2022. He said the governorship and House of Representatives primaries will be held on May 26, 2022 while the senatorial and House of Assembly primary polls would be held on May 27, 2022. Morka said the mode of primaries would be contained in the guidelines to be issued by the party. He, however, said zoning has not been decided.
