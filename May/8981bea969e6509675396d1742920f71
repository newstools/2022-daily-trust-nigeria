 Young banking professionals have been encouraged to embrace integrity, innovation and personal development in order to excel in their careers. This advice was given by Chief Executive Officer, Fidelity Bank Plc, Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, who was the special guest of honour at the graduation ceremony of stream one mentees of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) mentoring scheme. Onyeali-Ikpe at the virtual event said, “When I started my banking career over 30 years ago, the first charge I got from my late father who was also a banker was that the best currency for transactions is not the United States Dollar, the British Pounds Sterling, or the Nigerian Naira. The best currency for any transaction is integrity. “This profession is a very noble one built on the highest form of ethics. So, my first charge to you is to uphold your integrity at all times. Let your customers and colleagues find you dependable and trustworthy,” she said. She also urged the young banking professionals to imbibe innovation and personal development as they navigate their careers. The CIBN President, Dr Bayo Olugbemi emphasised the need for 284 mentees to remain studious, diligent and committed in his welcome address. Olugbemi, who was represented by the institute’s National Treasurer, Mr Dele Alabi said the scheme is a platform for experienced practitioners to groom young banking professionals.
