The Lagos State government has urged the citizenry to be wary of unlicensed e-hailing operators within the state as they pose security threats to the safety of lives and property. The Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, who made the plea stated that the state government has observed high levels of non-compliance by some unlicensed operators who flagrantly violate the guidelines developed to regulate their activities. He disclosed that the government is displeased over the refusal of the App owners and partners (drivers) to comply with the law guiding their operation in the wake of criminal activities in the State. The transport commissioner maintained that the state government has held a series of meetings geared toward compliance with the regulations guiding e-hailing operations within the metropolis. He urged residents to ensure that they patronised only the licensed operators as many of the unauthorised operators do not have a traceable operational base within the state in case of emergencies or safety concerns. Highlighting the importance of the safety of lives and property in the metropolis, the commissioner declared that only eight out of the several e-hailing operators are registered and recognized by the state government. He further mentioned; Lagos Ride, Uber, Bolt, Let Me Run, Global Taxi, Zoom Run, Treepz (Plenty Waka) and Shuttlers as the lawful e-hailing operators recognised and licensed to operate in Lagos by the Lagos State government, while In-drivers, Rida, and others are not licensed, urging anyone transacting business with them to be wary. While assuring that the state government will soon commence a clampdown on the violating operators, the transport commissioner enjoined the citizenry to collaborate by reporting any e-Hailing operators different from the ones listed above to the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation. He maintained that the state government will not relent in its effort to make Lagos State safe for all.
