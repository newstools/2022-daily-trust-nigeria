A magistrates’ court sitting in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has granted an order to remand a 33-year-old man, Baderinwa Waheed, over a fraud connected to the N-Power scheme. Moving his ex parte application, an officer of the Department of State Services (DSS), Olaolu Olayinka, told the court that the motion was for an order of court remanding the defendant in custody pending the completion of their investigation and transfer of the duplicate case file to office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). According to the charge, Baderinwa Waheed is reasonably suspected to have committed the offence of computer-related forgery sometime in March, 2021. That he conspired with one Tiamiyu Salimot knowingly and with intent to misrepresent and defraud, logged into one Olofin Adeola’s N-Power dashboard, changed her password, name and account number to that of Tiamiyu Salimot, thereby causing the victim to lose her five-month N-Power stipend calculated at N150,000. In her statement to the DSS, the victim had said, “I forwarded my N-Power details to the defendant to help me check if N-Power authorities sent any message to me as a result of my faulty phone. After checking, he told me no message was sent. I later went to check in another place where I discovered that the defendant hacked my account and diverted all my details to his wife who was collecting my stipend for five months. The case was reported at the DSS office after exhausting all avenues to retrieve my money.” The Magistrate, Bankole Oluwasanmi, said the accused was to be remanded for an initial period of 30 days and adjourned the case to June 20.
