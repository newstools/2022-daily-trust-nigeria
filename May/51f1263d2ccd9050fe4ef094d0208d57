President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated his commitment to the conduct of peaceful and fair elections in 2023. The president stated this when he received in audience an All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant vying for the Kano Central Senatorial seat, Senator Basheer Lado. Lado, while briefing State House reporters after his meeting with the president said: “As you are aware, Kano State is the largest producer of votes in Nigeria. “It is the decider of who becomes the next president in the presidential election. “Just like my Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has done in the past, I respectfully informed and reassured Mr President that the APC is still the party to beat in Kano despite recent defections.” According to him, President Buhari declared his commitment to credible elections that would ensure the emergence of candidates with integrity. “After my briefing, Mr President reiterated his commitment to credible and peaceful elections and also his desire to see candidates with integrity prevail at the polls all across Nigeria,” Lado said.
