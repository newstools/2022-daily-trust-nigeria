Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said that President Muhamamdu Buahri told governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who is his preferred candidate ahead the party’s presidential primary election. Governor Sule disclosed this during interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Tuesday. President Muhammadu Buhari had met with the 22 governors of APC earlier Tuesday to discuss the forthcoming presidential primary and the need to have a united position. Sule said, “The president said that our concensus candidate or the candidate to be selected must be acceptable to Nigerians, somebody who understands what the APC is all about and is after. “He mentioned clearly that the person must be able to go to all the parts of the country and be accepted. Similar to what President Buhari has said, we must bring someone that can win election and be able to sustain all the good things that the APC has done. “But if you are looking for a name the president didn’t mention that. He gave the attributes and allowed us to think of the right person in these few days while he is away in Spain. When he comes back everybody can say we have thought about it.” However, Sule said that by picking the PDP presidential ticket, Atiku is not just contesting against the APC’s presidential candidate but also the party as a whole. He added, “He has more work to do because he has to convince people that he is better than our candidate and APC.”
