The Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA) has appealed to the Federal and Kaduna State government to intervene through the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and consider the use of the old Kaduna Airport for commercial flights to Kaduna. President, KADCCIMA, Suleiman Aliyu in a statement yesterday said the shutdown is adversely affecting the business climate as well as expected revenues and income in form of taxes that would have accrued to the Kaduna State government. He, however, observed that the temporary use of the old airport as a secure and convenient hub for air travelers and cargoes will go a long way in giving the commercial airlines the confidence to resume flights to/from Kaduna thereby reducing the hardship experienced by businesses and air travelers alike since the suspension of commercial flights to Kaduna. He said, “Even though a number of chartered flights operate from and into the Kaduna old airport at the moment, the call to temporarily use it as a hub for commercial flights becomes necessary as businesses and the ease of doing business is seriously affected by the closure of International Airport and absence of train services to and from Kaduna. “In addition, a significant number of conferences and socio-economic events of note earlier scheduled to hold in Kaduna had to be shifted to other places. This situation has – in no small measure – adversely affected business climate as well as expected revenues and income in form of taxes that would have accrued to Kaduna State government.” He appreciated the efforts of Kaduna State and the federal government of Nigeria in improving security within the State and along our roads nationwide adding, “The speed with which the portion of the rail track bombed recently by armed bandits was repaired is indeed commendable.” He then advised that the use of the old airport should be considered as a stop-gap measure until the security situation at Kaduna International Airport improves “It is our sincere belief that our appeal to His Excellency the Governor of Kaduna State, Mal. Nasir Ahmed El-Rufa’i OFR and the Federal Ministry of Aviation will be given the much-needed attention it deserves in the best interest of the State and the business community at large,” he said.
