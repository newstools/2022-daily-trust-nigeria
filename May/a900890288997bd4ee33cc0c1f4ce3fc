The Young Progressives Party (YPP) Monday appealed to Nigerians to vote for all its candidates during the 2023 general elections to reposition the country. The acting Chairman of the party in the FCT, Mr Akinlami Aduragbemi, made the appeal in a statement Monday. He said: “The present economic hardship, insecurity, high rate of unemployment, total collapse of the university educational system, high level of corruption in government of a party (APC) which came to power on the deceit of the anti-corruption mantra and serious degree of nepotism are some of the negative developments that would make majority of Nigerians to vote against the present APC government in the next general elections in 2023.” The YPP chieftain said the party had extended its hands of fellowship to good politicians who had by now realised the failure of the ruling APC. He further said, “The Young Progressives Party would usher in the new Nigeria of prosperity, economic recovery, security of lives and prosperity, as well as an egalitarian society. “For capable women picking the party’s nomination form this week, it is free, while youths of 40 years and under would be given 50 per cent discount.”
