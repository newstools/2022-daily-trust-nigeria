The Governor of Sokoto State and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has said Nigerians are finding the President Muhammadu Buhari administration “very discomforting”. He said this in Lagos when he met PDP delegates ahead of the presidential primary of the party. According to him, Nigerians should not take another risk of experimenting with leadership but should go for someone with the right mix of experience, capacity and competence to bring Nigeria back from the cliff. He said, “The job is a very tasking one; it requires experience because we cannot afford to take the risk of experimenting with leadership within this country again. “Yes, President Muhammadu Buhari was a governor, Minister of Petroleum and head of state, but he was not democratically elected and therefore never ran a democratic governance system. That is why he is strange to the current governance system in Nigeria and Nigeria is finding him very discomforting.”
