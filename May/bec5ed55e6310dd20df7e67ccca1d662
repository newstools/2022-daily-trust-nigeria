The Comptroller General of Customs (CGC) Strike Force, Team A, on Wednesday, said it recorded seizures worth over N6.6 billion in Lagos in the last eight weeks. It said the seizures were being smuggled into the country by dubious businessmen who would like to undermine the economic policies of the federal government. The Coordinator of the Strike force, Deputy Comptroller Mohammed Sani Yusuf, who made this disclosure while conducting newsmen around its warehouses in Ikeja and Ikorodu, revealed that no less than 4,000 bags of foreign were seized. Yusuf noted that the team collected N1.36 billion through Demand Notices (DN) from used valued cargos. He explained that the amount collected from DN raised would have ended in the pockets of those who, according to him, were often in the habit of depriving the government of its rightful revenue. Yusuf further said other items seized included 40 cartons of tramadol, 1,613 cartons of codeine cough syrup, 132 cartons of 200mg sildenafil citrate, and five cartons of chilly cutter; shoes of about 110 cartons, and ladies gel. Others are 1,030 slabs of donkey skin, 387kg of cannabis sativa, as well as 285 bales of used clothes.
