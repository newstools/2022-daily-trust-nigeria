The Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has withdrawn from the 2023 presidential race, Daily Trust reports. An official of the ministry said the minister would continue in office since he is yet to issue his resignation letter earlier and has been billed to attend more public functions. When contacted, his spokesman, Horatius Egua, said: “Just to inform you that the minister is sitting in the office. Thanks for your understanding!” Egua said the minister will be attending a Seplat event on Tuesday, May 17, in Abuja, hours after the expiration of the timeline given by Buhari for ministers with political aspirations to resign. “The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources will be at the formal launching of Seplat Tree for Life,” Egua said.
