A former Managing Director of the Nigeria Security Printing and Minting Company (NSPMC), Abbas Masanawa, has said he would build on the projects of the current administration in Katsina State if elected the state’s governor in 2023. Masanawa is among the nine aspirants jostling for the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket in Katsina. He was appointed the managing director of the NSPMC in 2018 by President Muhammadu Buhari. Prior to the appointment, Masanawa was the executive director in charge of finance and strategy of the same company. He had worked in the banking industry for years, rose to the position of deputy general manager in Zenith Bank, and had also served as a special assistant to Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Masanawa, in an interview with newsmen in Abuja yesterday, said though he is a greenhorn in politics, he is upbeat that he would emerge as the party’s standard bearer in Katsina. “Government is continuum. Ours is to build on what the present government is doing,” he said. He also said he would improve the state’s internally-generated revenue through improved agriculture and blocking of revenue leakages. He said his topmost agenda if given the mandate would be education, security, building the capacities of youth and women, and economic empowerment. Masanawa said his achievements in his previous posts placed him favourably above other aspirants.
