A dairy brand, Hollandia, has urged consumers to prioritise dairy consumption as its much anticipated second edition of the Hollandia Dairy Day celebration held in Lagos. The annual event has become a major platform and reference for the promotion of national discourse around dairy consumption and its health benefits to consumers of all ages. This year’s event theme, “Dairy Nourishment to Support Healthy Living”, expanded on last year’s focus by emphasising the health benefits of dairy products and the importance of including them in daily meals. Managing Director of CHI Limited, Mr. Eelco Weber, stated that for the second year in a row, Hollandia is at the forefront of driving national conversations to highlight the health benefits of dairy consumption in our everyday meals. “This year’s theme “Dairy Nourishment to Support Healthy Living” presents a unique opportunity to challenge stereotypes, reshape our understanding and prioritise positive attitudes around dairy consumption,” he said. A resident doctor at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Obatomi Alalade, drew the link between dairy consumption and improved cognitive functions. Patience Madubuko, also a guest speaker and Chief Dietitian at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital delivering her presentation titled “The Role of Dairy in Addressing the Burden of Malnutrition” decried the relatively low consumption figures for dairy intake in Nigeria. “Dairy consumption is critical for helping to resolve the burden of malnutrition in Nigeria because of its essential nutritional components that spur the growth and development of the body when consumed daily,” she added.
