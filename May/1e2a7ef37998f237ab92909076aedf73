The Social Action Centre (SAC) Committee of the Catholic in Nigeria has urged the citizens to consider competency above religious, ethnic and other affiliations in electing political leaders in 2023 general elections. The National Coordinator, SAC-Committee and National President, Catholic Women Organisation of Nigeria (CWON), Dame Mary Asibi Gonsum; Convener, SAC-Committee and Founder, Catholic Action Nigeria, Chief Emeka Uzowuihe; and PRO, SAC-Committee and Chairman, Political and Governmental Affairs Committee, OSAN, Sir Peter Ikponmwosa Agbontaen, made the call on Monday in Abuja at a joint news conference. “We call on all political parties’ delegates to reject the influence of money in the choice of electing the party candidates and vote for credibility so that a handful of families or hidden interests will not bankroll our elections,” Dame Gonsum said.
