Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said the situation of Nigeria is so bad that the country needs a ‘mad man’ to turn things around for the better. Wike, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said this while addressing delegates of the party in Kogi State Wednesday. He appealed to the delegates to vote for him at the primaries, saying he has what it takes to govern Nigeria and take it to the promised land. The governor said, “The energy in me is too much. I want to use the energy to work for the country. “I have made myself available for my party, and to be voted to become the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Never in the history of this country have we so divided. I can bring back the country on its track of greatness. It doesn’t matter where you are from. It takes a mad man to govern Nigeria.” He said Nigerians need a fearless and courageous person like him who can speak the truth to power. “As for me, if you don’t vote for me in our party primary, I will still remain a member of the PDP. I have benefitted from this party, and so I have no excuse to defect to another party,” he said. The presidential aspirant cast aspersions on those who turned their back against the PDP after benefitting from the party, and called on the delegates not to doubt his sincerity in turning the economy around. In their remarks, the two former governors of Kogi State, Ibrahim Idris and Captain Idris Wada, including the state party executive members, extolled the virtues of Governor Wike, and assured him of their support during the presidential primary slated for May 30, 31 and June 1, 2022.
