A former Minister of Transport and a leading presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, says he has more experience than the party’s national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for the presidency job. Amaechi said this in Kano while consulting with Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje ahead of his meeting with the APC delegates. Amaechi told the governor that the people in the APC already know where his (Ganduje’s) loyalty lies but added that he was in Kano to convince him that he (Amaechi) was the most qualified among the aspirants. Daily Trust reports that Ganduje is believed to be a strong ally of Tinubu, who is also contesting for the presidency. Responding, Ganduje said even as Amaechi’s experience is known by all and his contribution to the economy and infrastructural growth of Kano is obvious, Kano, being a “swing state, will continue to swing”, and that Amaechi will know where the state eventually will swing to at the appropriate time. The governor refused to make any categorical statement of endorsement for the aspirant. Meanwhile, Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State yesterday declared that there will be no contest between him and the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi. Badaru, also a presidential aspirant, did not declare categorically that he had stepped down for the former minister. Addressing supporters and delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during Amaechi’s visit to the state, the Jigawa governor said: “Some of you might begin to think that Badaru is also a presidential aspirant, but I assure you that there is no contest between me and Amaechi. “So Jigawa delegates, when you think of me, think of Amaechi because we are the children of President Buhari. So, on that day, it is either I run or he runs, but for sure, I cannot run against him” From Clement A. Oloyede (Kano) & Mohammed Abubakar (Dutse)
