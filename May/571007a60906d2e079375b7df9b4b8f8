 The Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, has refuted claims of his withdrawal from the presidential race and urged his supporters not to entertain fear as he is working tirelessly to emerge as the APC candidate for the election. In a statement on Sunday by the spokesman of the Ahmad Lawan Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr Iyke Ekeoma, Lawan dismissed the possibility of running for another term in Yobe East Senatorial District. He said: “Nigerians should ignore the sponsored lies by some aspirants to distract the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, from his quest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in the next presidential election.” Meanwhile, Lawan has appealed to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and APC delegates in Kano to vote for him at the presidential primary. This is coming barely two days after the party’s delegates endorsed the presidential ambition of the APC National Leader, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, when he visited them on Thursday. He said, “I want all the 500 delegates. In fact, I need all the 500 delegates Your Excellency. If I can’t have the 500, please, let me have at least 400.” Earlier in his welcome remarks, Governor Ganduje said the people of Kano were aware of Lawan’s sterling qualities and his contributions to the stability of politics and governance in the country and assured him of “full cooperation.”
