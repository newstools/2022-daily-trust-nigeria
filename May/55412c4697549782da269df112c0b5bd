Traditional rulers in Boluwaduro LGA of Osun State have backed the re-election bid of the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. The traditional rulers, led by the Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe and the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, said the modest achievements of the governor have earned him a second term, insisting that any attempt for the state to decide otherwise would be suicidal to the future of Osun.

Speaking in his palace where other traditional rulers across the council assembled, Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe, said the governor has performed creditably well to transform the state. He said: “We are satisfied with what God has made you to do within three and a half years. You have convinced us beyond reasonable doubt and done so much beyond expectations. I am appealing to you all to support him wholeheartedly because he deserves to be re-elected.” Addressing the party loyalists at St. Thomas, Otan-Ayegbaju, the campaign venue, Oyetola promised to consolidate his modest achievements and improve on them in his second term. He warned members of the opposition parties to be cautious, saying campaigns and elections are not about violence. Oyetola expressed surprise over an attack on members of the press and loyalists of the party shortly after his campaign at Gbongan. He appealed to members of the party not to panic just as he called on security operatives to go after the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
