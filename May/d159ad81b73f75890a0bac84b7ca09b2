A widow and mother of four, Mrs Sefi Jimoh, who was kidnapped on Sunday at Phase 11, Lokogoma area of Lokoja, capital of Kogi State, has regained freedom from her abductors. The state’s Commissioner of Police, Edward Egbuka, confirmed her release, saying the woman had since rejoined her family. The widow was abducted on Sunday while waiting to board a motorbike after a prayer session at the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Church, Lokoja. Daily Trust learnt that her kidnappers, on that Sunday evening, called her family and demanded N10m to secure her release. However, the CP said, “No ransom was paid as the widow was released by her abductors when they discovered that the police were closing in on them”. A family source confirmed Mrs Jimoh’s release in the late hours of Tuesday, saying, “We are so grateful to the Almighty God for the safe return of our sister and wife.”
