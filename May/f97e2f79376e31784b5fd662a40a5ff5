The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has sensitised 150 traders in Kano on its recently introduced Domestic Export Warehouse (DEW) meant to ease the means of exporting local goods to global markets. The sensitisation workshop which took place at Tahir Guest Palace gathered exporters from across exportable commodities within Kano State. The Executive Director and CEO of NEPC, Dr Ezra Yakusak, said the idea of the DEW was to address challenges faced by exporters while exporting their products abroad which posed many threats to their businesses. He said Nigeria had been unable to convert its enormous comparative advantage in production of many agricultural primary produce to competitive advantage in the global marketplace as a result of supply chain constraints, which prompted the need to prosper solutions. “The ability to resolve these challenges will go a long way in addressing supply chain gaps in the export value chain, and substantially increase non-oil export volume/value by between 25%-30 per cent as projected by the International Trade Centre (ITC),” he said. A beneficiary, Usman Ahmad, said, “We experience a lot of challenges in this regard. We often get patronised by exporters, but it may take months before delivery, and hence lead to order cancellations and sometimes decay of products. But with this kind of development our problems seem to have been addressed.”
