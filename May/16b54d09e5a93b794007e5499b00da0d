A son of the late Chief MKO Abiola, presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Kola, has declared intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). Kola submitted his nomination and expression of interest forms to the party’s secretariat in Abuja yesterday. Briefing newsmen, Kola said the way out of the current challenges was for the country to have good leadership that was accountable to the people. He promised that whoever won the primary election of his party “we will all come together and work for the party.” Meanwhile, the National Secretary of PRP, Babatunde Ali, said the party was prepared for the general elections.
