The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) yesterday alerted members of the flying public that there would be flight disruptions across the country following the persistent scarcity of aviation fuel known as Jet A1. Daily Trust had earlier reported how aviation fuel scarcity has continued to bite hard causing flight disruptions over the weekend while hundreds of passengers were stranded at various airports. However, there is no end in sight yet to the scarcity of the fuel, which operators also claimed has been on the increase in recent times. Spokesman for the AON, Prof.  Obiora Okonkwo, in a notice issued yesterday said there would be disruptions to scheduled flight operations of members of the association. “This development is being forced on members by the growing scarcity of aviation fuel popular as  JetA1. “The scarcity is impacting negatively on seamless conduct of air transport operations and would lead to flight rescheduling and or,  cancellations. “However,  the association and its members are working very hard and in alliance with product marketers, government and relevant stakeholders, to ensure availability and proper pricing of aviation fuel in the country. “While  pleading  the  understanding  of  the  flying  public  in  the  face  of  this  reality,  we  also  promise  to  do  all  that is  necessary,  and  within  our  powers,  to  restore  normal flight schedules  as  soon  as  possible.” Findings by Daily Trust revealed that many airlines had to reschedule their flights yesterday as the scarcity persists across regions.
