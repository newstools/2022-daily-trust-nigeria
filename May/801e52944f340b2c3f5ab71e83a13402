An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Lagos, Ahmed Olorunfemi Mustapha, has insisted he was shut out of the primary conducted on Saturday and called for the nullification of the exercise. The state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, emerged as the party’s candidate in the exercise. There were reports that Mustapha was barred from the venue of the primary at Mobolaji Johnson Stadium Onikan, Lagos. Daily Trust reports that the party’s leadership had earlier endorsed Sanwo-Olu for a second term and his candidacy was expected to be affirmed at the primary. However, two chieftains of the party, Mustapha and Wale Oluwo, a former commissioner under former governor Akinwunmi Ambode, purchased forms to contest against Sanwo-Olu. In a petition to the national chairman of the party, Mustapha stated that the process was flawed and called for a fresh primary. He said it was at the venue of the election that he was told that he was not cleared to participate in the primary, adding that he found the information new to him.
