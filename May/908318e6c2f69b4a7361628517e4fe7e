 Some stakeholders under the umbrella of the Northern Broadcast Media Owners Association (NBMOA) have called on the presidential, governorship and other aspirants vying for various offices to shun campaign of calumny and imbibe issue-based campaigns. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, acting Chairman of the NBMOA, Alhaji Abdullahi Yelwa said the 2023 presidential aspirants should have a clear agenda on how to tackle the socio-economic and security challenges bedeviling the country. “In the North, we are daily confronted by a unique set of existential challenges. The scourge of banditry, terrorism, internally displaced persons, drug abuse, rural poverty, out-of-school children, youth unemployment, begging and the threat of hunger have become epidemics that have defied solutions. These are the issues that should be at the centre of political discourse. “I wish to therefore call on all aspirants, especially presidential, gubernatorial and National Assembly aspirants to avail their political agenda to the people of the North and the nation,” he said.
