The Chancellor of Gregory University , Uturu- Abia State, Prof Gregory Ibe, has given reasons he abandoned the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Prof. Ibe, who was a governorship aspirant on platform PDP in Abia state, said he dumped the party because it appears they is no gentleman seeing what is good in the state. He stated this while interacting with our reporter in his country home in Uturu, Isiukwuato in Abia state. According to him, everything about PDP in Abia is deceit and lies and it can no longer be sustained. He accused Abia PDP of politicising and lying about everything in the state for some individual selfish interests without regards to public interest. “Nobody is a gentleman any more because of politics. PDP will tell you good morning when it is not morning. It will renege on every agreement it makes . I’m a gentleman, I stand by my words, I want remain a gentleman.
I am not ready to go back to PDP again. I am now fully in APGA and there is no going back ” he said. According to Prof .Ibe, Abia is suffering because of poor leadership recruitment, adding that the state will continue to suffer until there is proper recruitment process. He said the state had been recruiting people who were not prepared for leadership position over the years and it is time now to recruit people who are ready and prepared for work. Ibe said that if the state recruitment process were anchored on merit with people of managerial skills, the state would have been developed beyond imagination. “People with proven records of management skills should be allowed to lead Abia state now. I am offering myself with my wealth of experience acquired over the years in private sector to lead Abia,” he said. He also said that if he is elected the governor of Abia state, no child or community would be neglected.
