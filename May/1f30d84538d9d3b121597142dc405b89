 The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Coalition for Mass Mobilisation has asked all Nigerians to pray for peace and unity in the country and the success of the 2023 general elections. Nigeria is facing socio-economic, political and security challenges, which many believe would affect the 2023 polls. In a Sallah message on Monday in Abuja, the National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Musa Ali Otigba also urged party members to pray hard for God to choose the best among the many aspirants as the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 general poll. “As you all know, our dear country Nigeria is due and preparing for another round of general elections in 2023. I hereby urge you all to please, use this occasion of Eid-el-Fitri celebration to pray for peace in Nigeria, and peaceful conduct of the election. “More importantly, let us pray for our dear President, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, and other leaders at various levels across Nigeria, for God’s guidance in the discharge of their duties,” the group said.
