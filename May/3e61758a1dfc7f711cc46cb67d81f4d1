The North Central Women leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Princess Zahra Mustapha Audu, has said the ruling party can mitigate post-convention crises by creating a level-playing field for all the presidential aspirants and delivering a free and fair process. Princes Zahra who donated food items to over 3,000 underprivileged women and children in Abuja, Kogi and Kwara states told newsmen at the Al Anur Mosque during the exercise in Abuja, that the APC-led government was committed to making life better for Nigerians. Many presidential aspirants have sprung up following the party’s announcement of May 30, 31 and June 1, 2022 for presidential primaries. Responding to a question on how the party would field its 2023 presidential candidate, Prince Zahra said, “I will suggest a free and fair process for the aspirants. Let’s allow them to test their popularity. But again this is my own opinion. “But every single aspirant that has shown interest to run is capable of doing well as president of this country. I plead with our party leaders to create a level-playing field for all the aspirants to feel comfortable, to be able to support whoever becomes the presidential candidate. “If they feel carried along, if they feel that the process was free and fair, if they feel that the process was justifiable, they will be happy to support whoever emerges. In every process you find disgruntled elements but we have to try and please as many as possible.”
