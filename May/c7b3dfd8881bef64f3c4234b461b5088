The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has urged political parties to stick to the 2023 elections timetable as it would not allow party primaries beyond the June 4 deadline. The INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, outreach and partnership committee (OPC), Prof. Kunle Ajayi, said this yesterday in Abuja at INEC International Republican Institute (IRI) and Women’s Democracy Network (WDN) engagement with political parties on women participation in primaries for 2023 general elections. He said the 18 registered political parties that would participate in the 2023 general elections have been given election time to conduct their party primaries ahead of the general elections and would not tolerate late conduct of the primaries. “The commission fixed April 4th to June 3rd, 2022 for political parties to conduct their primaries to democratically elect their standard bearers for 2023 general elections. INEC is not ready to listen to any excuse that will be contrary to the Electoral Act,” Ajayi said. He also enjoined women to come all out and take their rightful position in Nigeria political scheme. He said the low membership of women in parties’ leadership structures and decision-making positions, and as aspirants, candidates for elections, elected or appointed officials in government, has denied the country the full potential and the positive contributions of the women folk to national development, and to the building of a more inclusive society.
