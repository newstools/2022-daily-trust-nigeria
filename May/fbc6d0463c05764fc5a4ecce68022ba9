The Kogi State Government has warned civil servants in the state against joining the Labour Party (LP) or any other political party. The state’s Head of Service, Mrs Hannah Odiyo, gave the warning yesterday while reacting to a statement credited to the state’s Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Onuh Edoka, on the involvement of civil servants in party politics.

Mrs Odiyo, therefore, urged all civil servants in Kogi to stay completely out of partisan politics, advising them to be guided by the provisions of Public Service Rule No: PSRS-030422 and 030423, which prohibited civil or public servants from joining any political party, noting that the rule only permitted them to register and cast votes during elections.
