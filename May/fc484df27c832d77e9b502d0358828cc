LG Electronics, a home appliances and electronics firm, has launched a commercial laundry system while offering free laundry service in its Abuja outlets among other places. At the product launch in Abuja at the weekend, the company also showcased other new products like the steam clothing device, and outdoor cooling unit.  LG Head, Corporate Marketing West Africa Operation, Mr Hari Elluru, said the commercial laundry system is to support entrepreneurs who are into laundry business. In his remarks, the Head LG Commercial Laundry System, Mr Samuel Odenusi, said the laundry machine is convenient and has a warranty of 10 years, noting that consumers can do their laundry for free with the product during the test run. “To boost customer service quality, the company has opened some outlets in Nigeria where customers can have a feel of the LG Commercial Laundry System by doing their laundry for free. This will spread to other parts of the country with time.” On the clothes styler machine, he said it cleans and disinfects some fabrics like suits, duvets and embroideries that do not need washing every day. “It does not do the work of a washing machine; this machine turns 200 times in a minute and with the heat it produces in the process, it removes germs, heat, dusts and straightens the materials. “Cloths that have stayed in the wardrobe for long are meant to undergo this process to look fresh,” Odenusi said. The company also clarified on how consumers can identify fake LG products, noting that consumers should always check product warranty and ensure that they filled and submitted the information booklet to the outlet where they bought the company’s product.
