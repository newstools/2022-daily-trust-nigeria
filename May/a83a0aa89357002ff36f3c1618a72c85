Speaking at the rally held in Abuja, director-general and convener of DOFF, Hajiya Bolanle Kaji-Hausa, said the rally was to call for support for Osinbajo to emerge as the All Progressives Congress (APC) consensus candidate. She said: “As you can see, judging by the crowd of women and youths, including young children who are here today in support of Professor Yemi Osinbajo, it is evident that women and young people are in support of his aspiration, and millions of them across the country are ready to support him and ensure his success at the polls in 2023.”
