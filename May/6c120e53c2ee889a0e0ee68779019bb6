Mass resignation of political bigwigs has hit the Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The development followed the resignation of the former governor of the state, Mr Peter Obi, from the party. His action was said to have dampened the zeal and aspiration of some of the party’s aspirants for national and state legislative seats from the state. The PDP’s governorship candidate in the November 2021 governorship election in Anambra, Mr Valentine Ozigbo, and former members of the House of Representatives, Hon. Valentine Ayika and Hon. George Ozodinobi, have also resigned from the party.  Ozigbo in his resignation letter which was addressed to the national chairman of the party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, stated that the party had been hijacked by three senatorial aspirants and their cohorts.  A source within Anambra PDP told Daily Trust that more prominent politicians in the state would also dump PDP in the coming days.
