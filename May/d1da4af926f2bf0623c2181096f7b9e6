The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) on Wednesday in Abuja launched the FAAN Taxi App to facilitate seamless taxi-hailing at the airport and even downtown. The FAAN app will have all taxi operators at the airport register on it and passengers will call the drivers using the app, thus eliminating situations where touts harass passengers with all manners of unregulated taxi services. Capt Rabiu Hamisu Yadudu, the FAAN managing director, said during the launch that beyond the elimination of touting, the app would also enhance the revenue position of FAAN as leakages would be blocked. Represented by Group Capt Usman Abubakar Sadiq (Rtd), the Director of Security Services, the FAAN MD said all taxi operators would be uploaded on the app to be able to operate taxi services at the airport. He thus encouraged all taxi operators at the airport to get on the app for a more profitable business. Also speaking at the event, Mr Sadiku Abdulkadir Rafindadi, the FAAN Director of Commercial and Business Development, said, “The App will enhance seamless passengers’ facilitation, comfort, safety and security of Nigerians using it.” He said you could be at the airport or anywhere else and call FAAN Taxi App drivers to take you from the airport and even also move you around town. He further said they had on-boarded over 900 drivers, including the existing car hire operators, Uber drivers, Bolt drivers and others on the app.
