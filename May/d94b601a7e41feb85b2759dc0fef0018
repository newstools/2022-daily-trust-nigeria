In a statement yesterday, the firm said the event will bring together stakeholders towards driving national discourse on the health and nutritional benefits of dairy consumption. With the same theme as last year, “Dairy Nourishment to Support Healthy Living,” the company said this year’s celebration will further highlight the role dairy consumption plays in daily nourishment.
