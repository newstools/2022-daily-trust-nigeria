CEO of Katchey Laboratories Limited, Mrs. Kate Isa, explained that the laboratory was built as a one-stop-shop for all analytical needs, catering to a wide range of analytical service areas, including life sciences; pharmaceutical; food and beverage; agribusiness; oil and gas; environmental; forensic; mining and extractive industries; educational; research and development. In addition, it will result in “Significant foreign exchange savings because samples, which hitherto are being sent to laboratories outside the country and which are paid for in foreign currencies will now be taken to Katchey Laboratories for testing.” “This accreditation is really exciting for us all at Katchey Laboratories Limited because the laboratory complex was borne out of the need to raise the bar in the analytical space in Africa and to provide reliable, quality results that will inspire confidence to encourage trade across the continent, especially with the advent of AfCFTA, and to so in a timely manner,” she said. Also speaking, the CEO of Bloom Public Health, Professor Chimezie Anyakora, stated that “This is an exciting moment for the country to have a lab of this quality available to support trade and public safety.” “Beyond providing quality results, this lab will achieve much for the country by helping boost the confidence of Nigerians, both in international commerce, to export their Katchey-Laboratories-certified products globally, with confidence; and internally, to inspire a crop of analysts and scientists,” he said.
