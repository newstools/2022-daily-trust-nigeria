Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has launched its Africa Day Campaign aimed at amplifying the voices and stories of people and businesses from across Africa that are impacting the world. The global campaign, “Made by Africa, Loved by the World”, was first launched in 2021 to spotlight and celebrate Africans making global impact. This year’s campaign spotlights eight creators, innovators and Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) who are making a name for themselves in Africa and globally and are changing the way Africa is viewed on the international stage. As part of the on-platform and marketing campaign, Meta has partnered with local filmmakers, including Tarryn Crossman (South Africa), Kofi Awuah (Ghana), Joan Kabugu (Kenya), Bardia Olowu (Nigeria) and Nelson Makengo (DRC), to bring to life eight phenomenal stories, in addition to a dedicated global and local Instagram campaign featuring partnerships with African content creators, a community Reels challenge, the development of a specially designed Augmented Reality (AR) filter inspired by #AfricaMade, as well as a series of free open virtual training sessions via the Meta Africa page dedicated to all SMBs and creators from across Africa. Commenting on the campaign, Communications Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Kezia Anim-Addo, said the campaign was about showcasing the incredible talents on the continent. Kezia said, “At Meta we remain invested in Africa, and know that this is home to some of the world’s most talented and inspired individuals, and we look forward to hero’ing just some of these stories through our ‘Made by Africa, Loved by the World’ campaign.”
