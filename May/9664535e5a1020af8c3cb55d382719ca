Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has said Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso will have an easy ride to Aso Rock if the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) zones its ticket to the South. Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), has been making waves since he joined the party last month. Speaking when he appeared on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Monday, Kalu said, “Let me tell you that whether in APC or PDP, the problem we have now is Kwankwaso. Our problem is not APC or PDP. Because Kwankwaso is already a presidential candidate we are in problem. “We are forcing every party – that is what I saw – to pull out. Because of Kwankwaso if  you give me the ticket from the South East, I will lose and it would not be good for us. “Kwankwaso left PDP and went to NNPP and if PDP or APC zone its presidential ticket to a candidate in the southern Nigeria, then Kwankwaso is a president in waiting. I can assure you that knowing the mentality on the ground, unless we are telling ourselves lies. “I cannot lie to myself; I’m a student of realism. So Kwankwaso is the problem because if PDP goes to North and the APC goes to south it’s as well telling myself to pack my luggage and go. I’ll not have a job in the National Assembly or the federal government of Nigeria. That’s the truth. Whether you want to believe it or not, Kwankwaso has changed the dynamics.” However, Senator Kalu said that the South South and the South West are not fair to Igbos who have not produced a president, saying “If you wall then you allow your brother to walk. If you rule you allow your brother to rule. 2023 elections will mould Igbos’ thinking.”
