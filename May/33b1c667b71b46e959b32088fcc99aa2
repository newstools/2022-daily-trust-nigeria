 As Muslims observed the Eid el-Fitr, traders at the Benin Eid ground along the Benin-Auchi road made brisk business. The traders who sold caps, biscuits, clothing, mats, beverages and other items, said business was good and that they would also have money to celebrate the Sallah. One of the traders, Abubakar Yohana, said, “Today, within three hours, I made N10,000. I sold eight pieces of cap which I usually battle to sell in two days. I thank God for today’s business.” Another trader, Mutari Salisu, who sells prayer mats, said, “I appreciate God for today because of the money I have made. I came here by 7am, and by 10am, I made N13,000. “As you know, many people don’t come to the mosque with prayer mat, so they have to buy from us. I am really happy.” Another trader, Murtala Muhammed, who sells biscuits, said, “Today is an Eid day and I made good use of the Sallah opportunity. Within a short period I made N5,000. I have money celebrate the Sallah.”
