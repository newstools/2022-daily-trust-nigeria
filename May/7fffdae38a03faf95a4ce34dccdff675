The federal government has given terminal operators and freight forwarders two months to comply with the implementation of Practitioners Operating Fees (POF), payable to the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN). The Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi stated this in Lagos, a statement from the ministry said. The minister observed that following non-compliance since POF was instituted on February 24, 2022, the ministry will hence demand a report on the level of compliance at the end of the two months period (June -July). “After two months, and it is not complied with, we will now begin to look at sanctions. You can’t come to a country and choose the process of engagement. You have rules in every country on how businesses should be run and you have to comply with them. We don’t have any exemption for anybody. Businesses have to be run based on the rules of Nigeria,” he said.
