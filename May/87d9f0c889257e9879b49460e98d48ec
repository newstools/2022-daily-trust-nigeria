The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has amid controversies commenced primary elections to elect candidates for the 24 seats in the State House of Assembly and nine constituencies of the Federal House of Representatives. The party has been in crisis as a result of the supremacy battle between the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, and the South-South National Vice-Chairman of the party, Dan Orbih, which led to indecision on a date for the primaries. The national body of the party had announced May 22 for the primaries while a new date surfaced on social media on the eve of the primaries that it would hold on May 24.
