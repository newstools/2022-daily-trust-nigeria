Senate President Ahmad Lawan yesterday said his presidential bid is in his capacity as a Nigerian who is qualified to be President and not as a northern aspirant as is being insinuated in some quarters. “I am not running as a northern aspirant because the impression created is that I’m a northern aspirant or that northerners are saying they are not going to allow power to the South. “I’m not running as a northern candidate. I’m running as a Nigerian Presidential aspirant and therefore I come with all my qualifications for that office and people should judge me on the basis of what I have to offer,” Lawan said in Katsina. The Senate President was in Katsina to seek the support of party members particularly the delegates for his presidential bid ahead of the party primaries later this month. Lawan, who is one of the longest-serving Nigerian Federal lawmakers having been elected into the National Assembly since 1999, said he possessed the requisite experience and qualifications that put him at an advantage over other aspirants. “We have been around for some time. Thank God, from 2019, we have been working with the President of our Party, President Muhammadu Buhari, very closely. I know and I understand most of the national issues that we deal with. “The fact that we came out last speaks volumes because I didn’t just wake up one morning and say I want to be President. It took a lot of time for those who believe in me to talk to me to also throw my hat in the ring. And after some time, I accepted,” he said.
