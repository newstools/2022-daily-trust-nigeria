The Ekiti State Governor and APC presidential aspirant, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has promised to address the lack of adequate representation and compensation for Abuja indigenes if elected president. He pledged to ensure that the original inhabitants of the FCT were properly compensated and given a pride of place in the scheme of things. Bizman detained after ‘criticising’ Gombe gov granted bail Abuja-Kaduna train attackers give conditions to FG Fayemi made the promise while addressing party leaders and the expanded delegates in Abuja yesterday. He said, “My government will address this imbalance and revert to the original number of local government areas which gave the indigenes effective representation. “We shall also build on the gains of the security architecture put in place by the Buhari administration. Many are quick to forget how the FCT became a hotbed of violence and frequent bombings between 2012 and 2015. “Many may have forgotten the UN House bomb incident, the Banex bomb incident and several incidences of terrorism. We appreciate how far we have gone, but we shall address the gaps noticed, introduce intelligence, technology, retool the armed forces and bring to bear my expertise in security consultancy round the world by bringing innovations that will ensure that the FCT becomes a fortress and the safest place to live, work and do business. “My focus would be on bringing peace to my fatherland and ensure that the Ibadan man finds home in Sokoto and the Sokoto man finds home in Akure, Abakaliki, Onisha or Owerri. The Owerri man must find home in Damaturu. This is the Nigeria I want to fight for, and I’m confident it’s achievable.”
