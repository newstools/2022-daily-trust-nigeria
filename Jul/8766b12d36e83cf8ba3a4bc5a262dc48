The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, experts in public policy and leading industry players in the building and construction industry in Nigeria have affirmed that “building up” is the best solution to tackling the problem of scarcity and high cost of accommodation in urban centres in the country. Sanwo-Olu, alongside the experts, made this assertion at the fifth edition of Lafarge Africa’s public policy thought-leadership series, “Concrete Ideas”, held in Lagos. The experts concluded that to fully harness the many advantages that high-rise buildings offered, the government and all the stakeholders in the building environment must take bolder steps to combat the many problems militating against mass development and the optimal use of high-rise buildings in the country. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, commended the incredible job Lafarge Africa is doing within the Nigerian construction sector. Speaking on the theme of the conference, the country CEO of Lafarge, Mr Khaled El Dokani, noted that the development of high-rise buildings was a trend in modern cities all over the world, mainly to overcome the challenges of urban overpopulation and for optimal use of scarce land resources.
