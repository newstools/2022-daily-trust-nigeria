 No fewer than 1000 youths are scheduled to attend the 2022 Youth Empowerment Conference organised by the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME). President and Chairman of the Council of NASME, Dr. Abdulrashid Yerima who briefed newsmen in Lagos on the conference holding in Abuja on July 21 said the event was aimed at providing an interactive forum for dialogue between young entrepreneurs representing the youth business community and policymakers as well as development organisations. Yerima who was represented by NASME’s Zonal Vice President, North Central, Prince Tajudeen Ajisefini, disclosed that a total of N2.25m will be given out as cash grants at the conference, with the top three young entrepreneurs awarded cash of N1 million; N750,000; and N500,000, respectively. This is in addition to getting business development support for bankable business plans, and becoming NASME Youth Ambassadors with one year free membership subscription to the association, he added. He said the association is worried about the high unemployment rate in the country and vowed to leverage the conference to devise solutions to youth unemployment.
