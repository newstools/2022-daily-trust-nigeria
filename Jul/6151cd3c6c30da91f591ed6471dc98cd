The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has raised alarm over the illegal conversion of the Kuje railway corridor to personal residences. The alarm was raised at the weekend during stakeholders’ engagement with traditional rulers, council representatives, traders and artisans from Kuje.

He said, “There is a serious security report that people are building indiscriminately on the rail corridor; this is unacceptable. “The extreme speed at which people are building at the rail corridor is alarming. Very soon there will be massive removal.  The rail corridor must remain green until when contract is awarded. “ If you buy, you buy at your own peril. The FCTA will demolish all and  not pay compensation. The corridor was largely empty until some persons put pressure on some locals to sell to them.” Attah also expressed shock that buyers of the railway corridor land  did not do due diligence investigation before spending their hard-earned money on such risky venture, and noted that the area would be cleared of all illegalities. He called on all the stakeholders within Kuje Area Council to take the warning home because the demolition would come at a time many might consider very inconvenient.
