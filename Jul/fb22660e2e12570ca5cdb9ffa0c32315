The candidate of People Democratic Party in the July 16 governorship election in Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has accused the administration of Governor Gboyega Oyetola of denying him access to the Osogbo City Stadium and the Freedom Park, Osogbo, for his final rally. Speaking with Daily Trust, Adeleke said he personally pleaded with Oyetola to allow him use the Osogbo City Stadium or the Freedom Park for his mega rally. He said PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and some governors, were expected to attend the rally. “For our mega rally, we are expecting PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and some Governors. I won’t tell you the names of the governors that are coming. The PDP National Campaign Committee for Osun election is showing commitment to this campaign, but we have been denied access to the stadium and Freedom Park.” The Commissioner for Information in the state, Funke Egbemode, denied Adeleke’s claim, explaining that the venues had been approved for other programmes before Adeleke applied to use either of them. According to political pundits, Saturday’s election is a two-horse race between Adeleke and Oyetola. Both men squared off in the keenly contested 2018 election which did not end on first ballot.
