The Enugu State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Peter Mbah, has said the state is not landlocked, stressing that he will make it an oil producing state if elected governor in 2023. He said this yesterday while addressing party members and supporters in Umulokpa, the headquarters of Uzo Uwani LGA during a thank you visit to the council area. “We are determined to exploit the assets in Uzo Uwani. I’m aware that Enugu State is not a landlocked state because of the coastal bodies found in Uzo Uwani. We are going to utilise it for the people of Uzo Uwani. “Enugu State is blessed with huge oil deposit and gas reserve because of Uzo Uwani. Through harnessing these resource endowments, we are going to make Enugu State an oil producing state. We have inland waterways and we are going to develop our waterway transportation,” he also said. He commended the people for their support during the party’s governorship primary election in the state and assured that he would reciprocate their gesture with good governance if elected as governor of the state in 2023. He also promised to reinvigorate all the dormant assets to give the local government the best economic outlook through industrialisation.
