An indigenous oil & gas company, Eroton, has bemoaned incessant vandalism in its facility amidst fresh incident concerns. Following the recent oil spill incident in Cawthorne Channel Wellhead 15 barely a month ago, the company confirmed that a second wellhead in its oil mining acreage suffered another incident suspected to be third-party interference. The Head of External Affairs and Corporate Communications, Mercy Max-Ebibai, who confirmed the incident, stated that the spill was observed at about 07 45hrs coming from the wing valve arm of the CAWC047L, which appears to have been vandalised with the valves, control panels, bean-box, actuators all carted away. “An electronic incident notification has been sent to the relevant regulators in the interim. Wild well control experts are expected to visit the site tomorrow to have an assessment of the current situation and design a solution to keep the well under control,” it said.
