A witness, Bello Yusuf, said Hassan died while vomiting after consuming the drink. He said, “Hassan and his friends, mostly touts and urchins, were seen drinking heavily during the day. They were competing over who would finish some calabashes of a local liquor popularly called burukutu. “It was during the contest that Hassan collapsed. His friends who tried to revive him took him away. When they were unable to bring him back to life, they abandoned him in an uncompleted building and fled.” A police officer at the Kubwa division told our reporter that “One Ibrahim reported that a man, popularly known as Hassan, was found dead in an uncompleted building in Byazhin”.
