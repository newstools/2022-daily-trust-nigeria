The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it has relocated the polling units situated in front of palaces, politicians’ houses, religious centres and other controversial areas. Ahead of the governorship election in Osun State, polling units were moved away from controversial areas to open spaces and public buildings. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Osun, Professor Abdulganiy Raji, disclosed this on Tuesday at a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the electoral umpire in Osogbo, the state capital. “Polling units were moved away from controversial areas such as the front of houses of politicians, front of palaces, religious centres, either to open spaces or public buildings. “This action is to ensure adequate security and peaceful elections. Flashpoints have been identified and strategies (have been) mapped out to resolve issues that can truncate the election process,” he told Channels TV. Raji also hinted at the conversion of voting points to polling units in a bid to ensure the expansion of voter access to polling units. He confirmed that all non-sensitive materials to be used in Saturday’s election have been batched to the polling unit level and ready to be conveyed to the various Registration Area Centres (RACs). He also said that the commission had concluded the production of maps of all polling units in the state – both electronically and hardcopy – for ease of movement and location of polling units by electoral officials. While stressing that poll officials had been prepared for the exercise and ready for deployment, Raji added that the security personnel in the state had also been trained.
