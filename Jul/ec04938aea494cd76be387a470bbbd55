The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has said that his acceptability is not only on social media. Obi, who appeared on Channeles TV’s Politics Today on Monday, was replying to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar’s claim that his (Obi’s) popularity is only on social media. Atiku had during an interview on Arise TV on Friday said Obi’s presidential ambition is just a hoax as 90 per cent of the North’s population is not on social media. Asked to comment on the Atiku’s claim, Obi said, “I agree with him; what he is saying is one of the problems we’re going to solve after my miraculous emergence (as president) to deal with the issue of educating the 90% per cent that are not on social media. “I’m going to invest in education; we need to educate them; we need to ensure that we equip them; because the problem he mentioned is actually the teeming population we need; I need to be able to turn that asset into production. “When I say the north is our next oil this is the population. They are the asset I need for the factories; for some of the factories are going to be located in Kaduna and Kano to be able to produce those agricultural produce and process them for export. Yes we will deal with it; but I assure you that we are not only just on social media. People are also listening to us and they know we have something to offer. And I’m sure that is what he wants to do as well.”
