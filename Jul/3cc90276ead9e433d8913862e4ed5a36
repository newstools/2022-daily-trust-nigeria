 The Ekiti State Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Ado-Ekiti has granted the request of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate for the June 18 governorship poll, Segun Oni, to inspect all materials used for the election at the state’s headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The tribunal, at its inaugural sitting yesterday, also granted Oni’s motion ex parte for substituted service on the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji. Oni had alleged that Oyebanji, his Deputy, Mrs Monisade Afuye, and a former caretaker Chairman of the APC and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, were deliberately evading service for the commencement of the tribunal’s proceedings. The chairman of the three-man panel, Justice Wilfred Kpochi, in his ruling on the two ex parte motions, said the grounds were the pillars that supported the applicant’s petition to continue at the tribunal. According to justice Kpochi, they found merit in the motion ex parte and ordered INEC to give unhindered access to the petitioner to inspect the electoral materials which include Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), all ballot papers and voters’ register. Oni was presented by a team of lawyers, including Biodun Fasakin, Owoseni Ajayi and Marakinyo Ogele.
