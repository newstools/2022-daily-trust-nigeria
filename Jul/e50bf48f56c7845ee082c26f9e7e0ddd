 A renowned political scientist, Professor Kamilu Sani Fage of Bayero University Kano (BUK), has said 2023 will be a “hard battle” for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. This followed the defeat of the party by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State, in addition to Oyo State which is under the control of the PDP. He said it was clear that the APC and its candidates may no longer be able to boast of getting a clean sweep of votes in the South West “because this shows that a lot of work is needed to be done in other for the party to get through.” He said, “Another thing the result in Osun is indicating is that PDP is not a pushover; meaning it is regaining its old strength. In the 2023 election, it will be a hard battle for the ruling party because the PDP is recuperating from its defeat since 2015.” He said, “It is more of people trying to be politically relevant in their area; they think it is only by harping on religion that they will regain relevance. But I think it (same faith ticket) will feature prominently in the campaign but it will not change the outcome of the result as people will want to believe.”
