Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said that the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi and his New Nigeria Peoples Party counterpart, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, have missed the chances of becoming strong contenders in the 2023 general elections. Sule disclosed this in Channels Television’s Political Paradigm, adding that he believed both LP and New Nigeria Peoples Party “are scantily popular and lack the national spread to win a presidential election.” 2023: Peter Obi can only win on Twitter &#8211; Kannywood Actress Is Peter Obi and ‘Obidients’ really ready? Sule insisted that the 2023 presidential election is a two-horse race between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said, “He is not even popular in Nasarawa State, so I don’t know of the nation. At the national level, based on what we read, there are four political parties that are strong, definitely the APC because we are the ruling party, the PDP because they have an excellent candidate. “Peter Obi was at one time a governor so he is there also alongside Kwankwaso’s party.  If you look at all these candidates, with all sense of humility, there are only two candidates at the top and they are Asiwaju and Atiku Abubakar.” Sule further said, “Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso missed their chance to be strong contenders in the 2023 presidential election when they failed to come together. “I am certain that the only way Peter Obi and Rabiu Kwankwaso could have staged a huge upset was if they had earlier merged their parties. “They will do very well, I have no doubt in certain regions, but to have the national spread is going to be very difficult because it is people who move political parties, not just the name or the individual at the top.”
