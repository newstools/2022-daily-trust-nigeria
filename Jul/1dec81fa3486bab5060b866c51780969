As the work of the coordinating committee on the recovery of outstanding ground rents of N29,506,643,943.98 owed the FCT Administration (FCTA) gathers momentum, a revelation has emerged that property owners in the highbrow areas of Asokoro, Industrial Area II and Maitama are the highest debtors; owing 10.67, 9.43 and 9.29 per cent respectively of the total sum. The committee is already fine tuning legal documentation to take all property owners who have failed to pay despite repeated warnings to court for revocation or outright forfeiture.
