The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said he rates the performance of President Muhammadu-led administration as pass or credit. He also expressed strong optimism over the APC’s chances of retaining power in the 2023 presidential election. The former governor of Nasarawa State stated this on Sunday during a conversation on Arise TV on the APC chances ahead of the general elections. Adamu said with 22 APC governors among the 36 states of the federation, he was certain of the party’s chances to win the presidential election. He said, “As I speak to you, we have 22 (APC) states. And I don’t have a reason to believe that we are not going to win. I don’t contemplate any situation that can make us lose the election. But that’s not to say we don’t have to work for it. We are working for our victory and by the grace of God, victory will be ours in 2023.” The APC leader added  that despite the party’s efforts to win the 2023 elections, he was aware of the problems bedeviling the country, adding that party was doing its best to address them, because “the whole thing about governance is to keep addressing these issues until we get to the promised land.” He further stated that the security challenges in the country did not start with the APC administration. He said he would give the Buhari-led administration a pass mark or credit for his performance so far. Adamu stated, “There’s no denying the fact that we face very serious security problems. There is no doubt about it. But if we are to be fair, the security challenges we are facing did not start with the administration of the APC. “I will give him (Buhari) a pass mark. I repeat, I will give him pass mark or credit.”
