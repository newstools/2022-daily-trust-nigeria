A pan-African crypto exchange platform, Mara, is set to launch a portal to the crypto-economy, “Mara Wallet”, which is focused on helping people manage their crypto finance needs. Mara Wallet is a fast and secure multi-currency crypto wallet that gives Africans control over their cryptocurrency as it offers both user-facing products and core infrastructure. It is designed to help users in Africa take a major step towards financial freedom and learn more about cryptocurrency and blockchain. Mara revealed a roadmap that would enable users to easily buy, sell, send, withdraw, store and protect a wide range of fiat and crypto assets such as cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in real time and without any prior crypto knowledge. According to Investopedia, NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. They can represent real-world items like artwork and real estate and tokenising these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more efficient while reducing the probability of fraud. Commenting on the pre-launch of Mara Wallet, co-founder and CEO at Mara, Chi Nnadi, said it was a step towards achieving crypto education, financial literacy and ensuring a more equitable distribution of capital. He said, “Our goal is to get sub-Saharan individuals started on their journey to leverage a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon and make the most of the financial-growth opportunities available in the crypto-economy.”
