Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, governors who are members of the party and many other bigwigs have stormed Osogbo, the Osun State capital, for the party’s grand rally ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The Grand Rally Reception Planning Committee, in a statement yesterday by its spokesperson, Funke Egbemode, said the rally was not just a gathering of party faithful, but also of lovers of democracy and good governance. The rally is scheduled to hold at the Osogbo Township Stadium, with party stalwarts from the national and state levels pushing for the re-election of the party’s candidate, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. The statement reads in part: “Leaders and chieftains of the APC, including the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, members of the central working committee, national campaign council, APC governors and other national and regional structures of the party are expected at the rally in support of Mr Adegboyega Oyetola, the party’s candidate in the Osun governorship election. “We trust that members of the APC will show the formidable strength and decorum the party is known for, even as we implore all residents and citizens of Osun to come out en-masse and in public acclamation of their overwhelming support for the APC candidate.”
