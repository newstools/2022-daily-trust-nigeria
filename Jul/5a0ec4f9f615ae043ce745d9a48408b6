A customary court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, on Thursday, dissolved a seven-year-old marriage between Laiatu Ayuba and her husband, Abubakar, over abandonment. The judge, Labaran Gusau, dissolved the marriage on the grounds of lack of love and peace in the union. He said, “It is on record that both parties have consented to the dissolution of the marriage and the petitioner asked for the custody of the children of the marriage which the respondent did not object to.

The petitioner is to allow the children spend weekends and holidays with the respondent. “The respondent is also ordered to give N50,000 to the petitioner for the monthly upkeep of the children.” Laiatu had dragged Abubakar to court seeking dissolution of the marriage on grounds of lack of love and abandonment. She told the court that, “I am exhausted in this marriage. Since I married my husband seven years ago I have not experienced love the way a wife should. “He stopped eating my food almost immediately after I married him. He doesn’t show me affection. ”The worst of it all is that he abandoned me and the children and travelled to South Africa.” (NAN)
