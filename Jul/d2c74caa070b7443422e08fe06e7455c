The opposition PDP in Katsina State at the weekend received thousands of defectors from the APC into its fold. Alhaji Ali Maikano Matazu, who is a retired director in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), led the defectors. Tinubu has 60% chances of winning 2023 presidency – VON DG 2023: Only LP can provide needed change – Benue gov’ship candidate Matazu contested for the Matazu/Musawa Federal Constituency primary in the APC but lost due to “injustice of the party”. The defectors were received by the PDP governorship candidate in the state, Senator Yakubu Lado Danmarke, in company of the state party Chairman, Yusuf Salisu Majigiri, and other party leaders. Speaking with our reporter, Majigiri said over 5,000 members of the APC were received during the event in Matazu. Addressing the crowd in Matazu, Senator Danmarke claimed that his party won all the local council seats in the recently conducted local government elections, but that the mandates were stolen by the ruling APC. He, however, expressed confidence that in the forthcoming general elections, the PDP would easily win the state, saying with INEC handling the polls the truth shall prevail. He then charged all PDP members and supporters in the state to ensure that their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVC) were intact ahead of the elections.
