 The Emir of Wase in Wase LGA of Plateau State and Chairman of the Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Alhaji (Dr) Muhammadu Sambo Haruna, says the North Central state have been suffering from incessant crises between farmers and herders. The emir stated this when the Chairman of Meyana Bioenergy Limited, a company that combines design, engineering, training and circular economy expertise, Mr Best, and his team paid him a courtesy visit yesterday in Jos. The emir, who thanked the company for citing such project in Wase, noted that Plateau and some other North Central states had over the years suffered hugely from diverse communal conflicts, especially between farmers and herders, adding that the crises had led to displacement of thousands of persons, especially women and children, and disrupted food supply. He said, “The farmers-herders clashes have been a threat to the food security of the state. We are happy that the project is targeted at reducing communal tension and promoting peaceful socio-economic exchanges between farmers and herders’ communities in Wase. In his remarks, Mr Best thanked the emir for the privileged reception, while highlighting the pedigree of his company which novel bioenergy technology had the potential to strengthen community cohesion between farmers and herders through sustained economic exchanges in Wase which could be replicated across communities with similar challenges.
