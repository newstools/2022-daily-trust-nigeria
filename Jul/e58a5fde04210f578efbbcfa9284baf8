The Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has said he prefers to pick a younger person as his running mate in the 2023 general elections. He stated this while featuring on Arise TV Morning Show on Wednesday. His statement comes amid talks about the possibility of an alliance between the former governor of Anambra State and the NNPP’s Presidential candidate, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. Obi said he prefers a younger person who has something to offer. He, however, said consultations are ongoing about the possibility to pick the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of Northern Elders Forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed as his vice. He said, “We are talking to quite a number of people and Hakeem Baba-Ahmed is a capable hand. But I wish I could work with somebody who is younger.” “I prefer younger people who have a lot to offer rather than recycling old hands. “I want a competent person and I am building a formidable team. “I want people who can look me in the eyes and disagree with me during cabinet meetings. People who have their own minds and ideas.” Daily Trust had reported how Kwankwaso, on Sunday, expressed optimism that the alliance between the LP and the NNPP will happen. He, however, said he is facing some challenges in its discussion with the Labour Party as a result of external influences. Contrary to the expectations of many, a Chieftain of the Labour Party, Doyin Okupe, on Tuesday, declared that there would be no alliance between Obi and Kwankwaso. He said the discussions about the possibility of a merger were dead and buried.
