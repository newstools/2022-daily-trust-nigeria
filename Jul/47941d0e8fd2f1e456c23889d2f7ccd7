Indigenous oil and gas firm, Obodofei has collaborated with an international construction engineering company, Global Process Systems (GPS), to build a gas processing plant in Bayelsa State. Obodofei said the project will bring power into the local community and equally provide job opportunities to the teaming youths in the state. Speaking in Abuja, during the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement between Obodofei and GPS, Executive Director of Obodofei, Dr Steven Bassey, said it had become necessary for indigenous firms to contribute to the national crude oil basket, adding that this can only be achieved through collaborations between indigenous oil and gas producers and their international counterparts in the service sector. According to Dr Bassey, GPS will provide the technical support, and train indigenous workers while Obodofei will ensure the delivery of the BAY-Gas & LPG hub that will make Natural Gas available, accessible, and affordable to the people of Bayelsa State He explained that BAY-Gas & LPG hub is an integrated Gas processing and LPG facility that will contain a 5mmscfd gas processing facility, a 500,000,000-metric ton refilling plant intended to service 30 Micro Distribution Centers to be fabricated and installed by the company. Also speaking, the Director of Project, Mr Ken Embeled, disclosed that the total cost of the project is N13.6 billion, adding the setting up of the Gas Processing and LPG hub in Bayelsa is a viable venture which will conform to all FGN aspirations to deepening the domestic utilization of LPG in Nigeria as contained in the National Gas Policy. A delegation from GPS led by Managing Director, Mr Martin Brownhill and Vice President Business Development Rajesh Shah, noted that they were impressed by efforts made so far by Obodofei to begin such a massive project. Martin noted that GPS was keen on doing its due diligence to ensure that the project meets the international best standards, adding that it will provide all necessary support, training and advice needed to build and operate the proposed gas processing plant and distribution gas turbine.
