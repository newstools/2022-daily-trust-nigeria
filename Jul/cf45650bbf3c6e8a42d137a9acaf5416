The United Kingdom’s national weather Meteorological Office (Met Office) has said London Heathrow reported a temperature of 40.2C. For the first time, at 12:50 on Tuesday, the Met office said the temperatures are still rising across the country with parts of the UK already into the high thirties.

In its first red emergency warning, the UK’s Met Office warned about the extreme heat on Monday and Tuesday. “It’s a provisional record, it says, and temperatures are still climbing. Just over an hour ago, a new provisional record of 39.1C was recorded at Charlwood in Surrey. “Until today, the record temperature for the UK was 38.7C, set in Cambridge in 2019. For the first time ever, 40 Celsius has provisionally been exceeded in the UK,” the Met Office added. However, Bloomberg reported that the temperatures in the UK are set to hit a record on Tuesday as a heat wave disrupts travel, business and schools, and poses a risk to lives across the country. It is also predicted that temperature will most likely exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across eastern England, breaking the previous record of 38.7°C set at the Cambridge Botanic Garden on July 25, 2019, according to the Met Office. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has linked the unprecedented temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius with climate change. WMO said, “Chances of seeing unprecedented temperatures of 40 degree Celsius (40°C) or more in the UK could be up to 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a “natural climate unaffected by human influence,”
