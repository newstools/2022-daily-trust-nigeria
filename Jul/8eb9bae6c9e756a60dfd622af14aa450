The Young Progressives Party (YPP) has said it will defeat the ruling APC in Plateau State in 2023 and take over the mantle of leadership. The Plateau Chairman of YYP, Simon John Gopep, said the party would spring surprises in the state because it had a better agenda for the people than the APC.

He further said the APC’s political office holders had done their best, but that it was time for change of batons for better service delivery to the people. The YPP governorship candidate in the state, Manji Gontori, said, “YPP has come to take over power in 2023; no doubt. This is because APC has already spent eight years but has done nothing for the people. Speaking in Langtang South, Gontori said, “The campaign office we want today is though a small office, but holds lots of surprises. So, don’t be surprised when they count the votes of YPP in Langtang South after the 2023 elections. Do not begin to ask whether it is from this small office that such votes were produced. “I always give example with APC in Plateau State; when we began it. We were initially going to the farms to bring people out to come and join APC. Then we didn’t have any office, and it was under the trees that we always met and discussed with them. Now it’s YPP which is beginning on this note, by opening party and campaign offices in Langtang, Shendam, Jos and other places.”
