A global marketing company, e-ntrepreneur, has disclosed plans to establish an e-commerce platform to tap into Nigeria’s potential online market offers. Speaking at the flag-off of the launch on Sunday in Abuja, the founder of e-ntrepreneur, Michael Hansen, said the platform would be a cash-back website that gives customers 30 per cent of what they purchase, thus, enabling them to save money on things they buy every day. Hansen, said with transactions in e-commerce in Africa contributing over $20bn in global trade and projections of it to double in the next five years, the region has an overwhelming potential for online transactions of goods. On his part, its Chief Executive officer, Villads Vest-Hansen, said tremendous opportunities are available through its platform to build global distributor organizations that focus on selling a variety of products. He said the platform has the most effective form of direct selling to drive traffic and transactions.
