All we need is to ensure we are able to participate in global exhibitions with our works,” she said. On the benefits of tapping into the market to augment the government’s dwindling revenues. “It is important for Nigeria to tap into the sector because it is a big industry that can help to shore up our revenue. When Nigerians travel out of the country, they visit art galleries, attend exhibitions and conduct museum visits. They spend the foreign exchange in order to see and watch what we already have locally,” she added.
