A middle-aged farmer has died in Dukku LGA of Gombe State after allegedly taking an overdose of a drug in a bet. The deceased, simply identified as Abba, was said to have taken 50 tablets of Exol in an alleged bet with some yet-to-be-identified people. Sources said the deceased had been a substance abuser before the incident. According to them, he approached the man who initiated the bet, asking for some drugs before he could proceed to the farm. “When the deceased was given 50 tablets of Exol, he didn’t hesitate to take them all at once and thereafter went to the farm. “Not long after he started work, he started vomiting non-stop. He was taken to a clinic where he was pronounced dead,’’ a source, who pleaded anonymity, told our reporter. His remains were interred in Dukku on Monday. The spokesman of the state police command, Maheed Muazu Abubakar, said the command was not aware of the incident.
