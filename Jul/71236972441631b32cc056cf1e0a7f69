The Osun State governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, yesterday received his certificate of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Osogbo, the state capital. INEC National Commissioner, Professor Kunle Ajayi, and the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Professor Abdulganiy Raji, presented the certificate of return to Adeleke and his deputy, Prince Kola Adewusi. Professor Ajayi said the commission remained committed to ensuring credible and acceptable elections in Nigeria. Speaking, Adeleke pledged that he would fulfill his campaign promises to the people of the state. He said, “This victory would not have been possible but for the goodwill of the patriotic men; young and old, who worked hard to make sure we reclaim our stolen mandate. I am overwhelmed by your love and support and I do not take this trust you have bestowed on me for granted. “Our state has now turned to a new page and we can now look forward to a bright future and a path for progress and prosperity for our people. Furthermore, I would like to specially recognise and appreciate my PDP family for their support. “I dedicate my victory to my late brother, the first executive governor of the state, Isiaka Adeleke, and every indigene of Osun State and to all my supporters, friends and families.”
