Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has explained why he will not contradict the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, on his choice of Ifeanyi Okowa as the party’s vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. Ortom had in an interview on Arise TV accused the former vice president of rejecting the popular recommendation for Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, as the party’s presidential running mate. But Atiku said it was untrue that he jettisoned the recommendation of the PDP committee on the selection of the party’s vice-presidential candidate. Responding to questions from journalists in Makurdi yesterday, Ortom, however, said that the matter was already being addressed as a family issue. The governor said, “I wouldn’t want to contradict my presidential candidate. Whatever happens rightly or wrongly, I accept it. We are the same family; we will find a way of resolving our matter.” He further said Wike was already being pacified by the PDP presidential candidate over the issues he had raised. He noted that, “All that I want done (for Wike), he (Atiku) has agreed and they are talking.”
