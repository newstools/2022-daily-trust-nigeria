The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the 2023 polls, Prince Adewole Adebayo, has asked the electorate to vote untainted candidates. Adebayo specifically said a politician with track record of integrity and incorruptible tendency should be voted to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Featuring on the Voice of America (VOA), Adebayo said Nigeria would be great if incorruptible politicians were made to lead the country. He said, “If you want to kick out poverty and insecurity, you will need to kick out corruption, and the only way you can kick corruption is kick the corrupt people out of office. “Nigeria is synonymous with many good things. It’s the government that is synonymous with corruption and why they have not been able to change is because they have not changed. “When you change the administration, you just recycle same people; they will not change their behaviour. And the only way to ensure things are different is vote the corrupt people out of office. That’s what we are going to do in 2023.”
