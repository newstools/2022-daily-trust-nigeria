The National Chairman of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Prof. Rufa’i Ahmed Alkali, has said the party needs votes from the South East and other geo-political zones to win the 2023 general elections. Rufa’i, in a statement on Tuesday, said the party’s presidential candidate and former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, was quoted out of context when he visited Gombe State as part of activities ahead of the 2023 poll. Kwankwaso was quoted to have said in Gombe, during a function that the South East is good in business and its people are well talented, but in politics, they are at the bottom line. But Rufa’i said, “The NNPP wishes to categorically state that the statement of its presidential candidate, Senator Kwankwaso, on the occasion was situated out of context. “We want to state that NNPP will canvass votes from all geo-political zones to win the 2023 presidential election and would not in any way consider any zone less as we have supporters and candidates all over the country. “The party or its presidential candidate would not in any way malign any zone or any individual, as we believe that in NNPP we desire the votes of all the zones and all the electorate to govern Nigeria.”
