The Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu, has unveiled an upgraded Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) data system that provides data for electricity access expansion. Speaking in Abuja, yesterday, while unveiling the SE4ALL platform version 3, the minister said the new online system is within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP) and was realised with support from the European Union (EU) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The Head of Green and Digital Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms Inga Stefanowicz, said: “The collected data and the new tools will be used to serve as pre-feasibility for private sector investment, allow the development of policies and frameworks as well as monitoring policy targets.” The Charge d’affaires of the German Embassy to Nigeria, Mr Martin Huth, said the interactive web platform will help the regulatory framework in improving electrification efforts and provide the private sector with data on business plans for investments. The Head of Programme, NESP, Mr Duke Benjamin, said the first version of the platform was launched in November 2020 and had significant usage of grid network data and off-grid surveys. The latest version integrated data on the mini-grids, the power sector and Solar Home Systems (SHS).
