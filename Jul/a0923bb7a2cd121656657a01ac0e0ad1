Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria yesterday suspended what it termed ‘national withdrawal of services’ after four days of warning strike embarked upon by its members nation-wide. The warning strike was to protest the rising cost of bread making materials. City & Crime had reported that the union comprising bakers and bread makers, had asked its members nationwide to stop operations as many of them struggled to cope with the cost of production. In a circular sent to our reporter, which was signed by the union’s president, Alhaji Mansur Umar, the bakers said the suspension of the warning strike was effective from Monday July 25 and that the decision was taken after the meeting of its national caucus. “This is to allow the federal government to take necessary measures to cushion our challenges in the overall interest of our dear nation. “All zonal, state and local government chapters of our association are advised to comply,’’ the statement read in part. City & Crime reliably learned that the national body of the bakers had resolved to jerk up bread prices by 20 percent nation-wide.
