Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has again disagreed with the Federal Government’s stance on the killings at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. The Federal Government had linked the killings to the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP). But Akeredolu had kicked against the comment, which he described as too hasty. He had said, “The statement by the Federal Government is too hasty. I take their conclusion with a pinch of salt. ISWAP doesn’t hide its attack. If they have done it, they would have owned up. We are yet to know their identity and our security people are still on their trail,” he had said. Speaking when he featured on a Channels Television programme on Monday, Akeredolu said, “I reacted to that almost immediately because I asked what evidence they have, the governor. It is important to let us know because the security agencies were too quick to jump to the conclusion that it was done by ISWAP. “But whatever it is, we stand by the position that it’s a trilogy that is operating in our forests and causing havoc. We just have herdsmen right in front, followed by these bandits, and again ISWAP; so, the three of them work together and they work separately.” On Sunday June 5, at least 40 worshippers were killed and many injured when gunmen opened fire at the church.
