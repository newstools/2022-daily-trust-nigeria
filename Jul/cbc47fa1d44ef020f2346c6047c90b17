Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has charged the “Obidient” movement supporters to be tolerant of dissenting views and divergent opinions. There have been complaints on how Obi’s supporters attack those who they perceive to be critical of the presidential candidate. The latest of such happened last week when Pastor Poju Oyemade of the Covenant Christian Centre was “bullied” to pull down a tweet said to be against Obi. We’ll help Nigeria enhance blood donation – Rotary Club Army Chief to officers: Be vigilant, don’t collaborate with criminals Oyemade had in the now-deleted tweets, said youths must not waste their enthusiasm on a “poorly planned project”. Although he did not mention the name of Obi, the presidential candidate’s supporters attacked him until the tweets were deleted. In a tweet yesterday, Obi appealed to his supporters to learn from views different from theirs. The former Governor of Anambra State said while “the frustration and anger in the country” could be responsible for such conduct on the part of his followers, their energy should be channelled positively. “While the frustration and anger in the country (are) understandable, we must strive to channel that energy positively in ways that will earn the support and collaboration of others.”
