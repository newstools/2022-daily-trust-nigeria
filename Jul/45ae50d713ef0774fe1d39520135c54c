There is a fresh crisis in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) as some stakeholders have asked security agencies to arrest, investigate and prosecute two of its founding fathers, Chief Chekwas Okorie and Chief Edozie Njoku, over illegal and criminal conducts. The demand was contained in a communiqué at the end of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) meeting yesterday at APGA’s National Secretariat in Abuja. In the communiqué, signed by all the members of the party’s NWC, they said they met to deliberate on salient issues and other sundry matters affecting the party in the build up to the 2023 general elections. They said the security agencies should treat with dispatch all issues pertaining to the unlawful activities of Chief Njoku, Chief Okorie and their co-travellers. The National Publicity Secretary of APGA, Barrister Tex Okechukwu, faulted Chief Okorie for claiming membership of the party. But reacting, Okorie said, “The call for my arrest is not only gratuitous, it is a preposterous demand that either lacks understanding of issues being canvassed. Leadership is not a toga you wear only when it’s comfortable or serves your pecuniary interests. “I founded APGA in 2002. None of these individuals were there. When brigands were sponsored to destroy APGA, and billions of naira spent to fight me, I chose to step aside so as not to destroy a vision that encapsulates the political aspirations of Ndigbo.”  By Saawua Terzungwe & Abbas Jimoh
