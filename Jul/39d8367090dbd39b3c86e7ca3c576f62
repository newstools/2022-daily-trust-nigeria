The Benue State Government has revealed that it does not plan to continue keeping Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in camps. It, therefore, appealed to the federal government and international donors to do all in their powers to ensure the safe return of the nearly two million IDPs to their homes and farms. The Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Dr Emmanuel Shior, made the appeal during the monthly distribution of relief materials to IDPs in the state. He said, “It is not our wish to keep the IDPs in camps forever as a government that is responsive and responsible. But it requires the support of the federal government in charge of security agencies to assist the state government achieve this by ensuring the communities are secured enough for them to return. “Since that is yet to be done, we have taken it as a responsibility to provide food and other support to the IDPs. We will continue to provide food for them on a monthly basis. That is why we’re here today also.”
