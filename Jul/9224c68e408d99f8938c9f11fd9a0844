He explained that, “As I stopped my vehicle, a VIO, Haruna Husseni, slapped me for just no reason and dragged me to their office at Kugbo. “When we got to their office, Husseni again started to slap and kick me until I fell on the ground.” NAN further reports that during an interview with the lorry driver, the Kugbo VIO commander sent for police officers to arrest NAN’s correspondent.
