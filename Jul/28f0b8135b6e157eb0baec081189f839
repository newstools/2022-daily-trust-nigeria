 Nigeria’s premium non-alcoholic drink, Eva Wine, has announced the launch of the “Search for Miss Eva” contest, a 5-week online competition to choose a new brand ambassador for Eva Wine. For five weeks, Eva Wine Nigeria is deploying an exciting online activation which will engage young ladies across Nigeria in a reality-type talent competition with intense activities to test their eligibility for the coveted role. Ladies between the ages of 25 and 35 across Nigeria are required to record a short video celebrating creatively with a bottle of Eva Wine and vibing to the campaign theme song #happymisseva. Contestants with the best entries will be shortlisted based on the panel’s verdict and the social media engagement they generate. Social media users and Nigerians all over the world will also have the opportunity to engage and vote for their favourite contestants via all official handles of the brand on the social media.
