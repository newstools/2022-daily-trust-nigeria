The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) supported by the West Africa Development Bank (WADB), has launched the Regional Off-Grid Electricity Access Project (ROGEAP) to increase renewable energy access in rural areas across Nigeria and 14 other member countries. This was formally done in Abuja where a national workshop for each of the ECOWAS member states started. Speaking at the event, the Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu said this would help to increase access to electricity in Nigeria. The minister, who was represented by the ministry’s acting Director, Department of Renewable and Rural Power Access, Engr. Ali-Dapshima Abubakar said: “The focus of ROGEAP is to increase access to electricity for households, commercial enterprises, public institutions and for productive uses, through stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems, in West Africa and four countries of the Sahel regions.” Coordinator of the project, El Hadji Sylla, said the project is framed in the ECOWAS Programme on Access to Sustainable Electricity Services (EPASES), directly contributing to the goals of the ECOWAS Regional Renewable Energy Policy (ERREP) with a target to provide universal access to electricity to the region by 2030.
