A mechanic, Taiwo Ojo, was on Wednesday evening electrocuted in the Byzahin Across area of Kubwa, Abuja, when a high voltage cable fell on him and his friends while they were making merry in a bar. A witness, Hassan Ibrahim, told our reporter that Ojo, who left his friends to ease himself, spotted a severed wire and tried to remove it with his hands. One of Ojo’s friends, Musa Muhammed, accused the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) of not always moving in quickly to remove cut cables that constituted danger. Another resident, Johnson Ruth, said it was not the first time such incident happened. When City & Crime visited the scene of the incident on Thursday morning, the cable had been reconnected.
