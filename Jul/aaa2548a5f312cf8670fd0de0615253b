The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said about 30 cases have been instituted against the party after its primaries held in the North West zone recently. The APC National Legal Adviser, Ahmed Usman El-Marzuq, disclosed this while addressing newsmen at the end of their maiden meeting, Thursday, in Kaduna. According to him, the purpose of the meeting was to address legal issues that emanated from the state assemblies, House of Representatives, Senate and presidential primaries. “Plus or minus, we can say we have about 30 cases so far in the North West zone from the primary elections. During such exercises, issues of complaints and petitions are usually received. The law has provided remedies for such complaints to be pursued in the various courts in the land. “We know at this stage the other parties and aggrieved party members will employ legal representation as well. So the meeting was intended to strategise ahead of the 2023 elections,” he said. He, however, said the cases would not in any way affect the chances of the party in the region. Barr El-Marzuq also said his team has succeeded in addressing other cases out of court, adding that they are also getting good response in their efforts to prevail on aggrieved party members to withdraw their cases. He added that the  legal team would visit the remaining five geo-political zones of the country on the same mission.
