Landlords in Kubwa, a satellite town in Bwari Area Council of the FCT, have increased rent, an action that has not sit well with tenants. Tenants who spoke with City & Crime yesterday said virtually all the areas in Kubwa were affected. They decried the increase, saying it was coming at a time people were feeling the effects of hard times in the country. A tenant, Joseph Kelechi, said for the past four years he had been paying N500,000 annually for a for a two-bedroom apartment. “But to my surprise, recently I got a notice from the caretaker that the rent has been increased to N750,000, which is 50 per cent increment,” he said. Alhassan Murtala on his part said he wanted a change of apartment because he was tired of the old house his family stayed in. Murtala said he was surprised that he couldn’t get a two-bedroom house in his area with N600,000. He noted that such apartment in Phase IV area of Kubwa now cost between N1.2m and N1.5m. Oguntade Adebisi, who lives in Byazhin Across, told our reporter that she now paid about four times what she initially paid when she moved into a single room about six years ago. She, therefore, urged government to intervene in regulating housing in Abuja and across the country.
