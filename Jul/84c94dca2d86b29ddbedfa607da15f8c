A compact crossover SUV made by SAIC Motor under the British MG marquee, MG HS SUV is not only large, charming and head-turning; its designer embraced the concept of X-Motion, which explains why the SUV exudes a real drive to do more.

Also, MG HS comes with the Lane-Assist System and Blind Spot Warning, which issues a warning, if there is another vehicle during the lane change or in the blind spot. MG HS boasts the largest virtual instrument panel in its class, with the 12.3-inch virtual cockpit, providing access to all the key driving information.
