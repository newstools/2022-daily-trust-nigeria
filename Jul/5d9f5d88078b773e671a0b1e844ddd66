The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has said the 2023 general elections will be the best ever in the history of the country. He said this on Tuesday in Abuja when he received delegations of the International Republican Institute (IRI) and that of the National Democratic Institute (NDI). He noted that the meeting was the first after last Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State, assuring that INEC would improve on its successes in subsequent elections. Pro Mahmood said, “We assure you that we will continue to work not only hard, but even harder to deliver the 2023 general elections. As for the preparation for the 2023 general elections, I want to assure you that we promised Nigerians that Ekiti was going to be good and Ekiti was a good election. “We promised that Osun was going to be better, Osun was a better election. We are promising that the 2023 general elections will be our best elections ever and we are committed to delivering the best elections ever.” Speaking earlier, the Secretary of State of Ohio, United States, and leader of the delegations, Mr Frank LaRose, commended INEC for its various efforts at improving on the conduct of elections in Nigeria. LaRose, who is also an election commissioner in Ohio, described his first visit to Nigeria as a great learning opportunity and urged INEC to keep improving on Nigeria’s electoral system. Reacting, an elder statesman and former presidential candidate, Chief Chekwas Okorie, told Daily Trust last night in a telephone chat that the commission would contend with the challenge of managing a large number of electorate in the election. He however, expressed optimism that the election would be largely successful because of the legal framework and use of technology which would enable Nigerians to monitor the votes online.
