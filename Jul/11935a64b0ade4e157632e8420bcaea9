Billionaire business mogul, Femi Otedola, has paid a visit to the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in France, tipping the APC national leader to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Otedola via his verified Twitter handle, @realFemiOtedola, on Tuesday tweeted a picture he took with Tinubu, describing the former Lagos State governor as his “great friend.” “I am always excited visiting my Great Friend Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu @officialABAT. May God grant him his heart’s desire in becoming the President of this great Nation,” he wrote. Despite extension, hope dims for 8,000 Nigerian pilgrims FG to recruit 1 million Nigerians for 2023 census – NPC Otedola’s visit is coming a day after the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, also visited Tinubu in France and took a picture with him. Abiodun in a tweet on Monday said he spent “quality time” with Tinubu to “rub minds on numerous party and National issues.” Tinubu had travelled to France last week after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday morning. His spokesman, Tunde Rahman, who announced the departure, did not state how long the APC standard bearer would be away, but said Tinubu was expected back in the country shortly. “He is off to Paris, France to hold some important meetings,” Rahman said in a statement. A day before his departure, Tinubu attended the public presentation of a book titled ‘Mr. Speaker’ and launch of legislative mentoring initiative in commemoration of the 60th birthday of the Speaker of House Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. On June 8, Tinubu emerged the APC presidential candidate at the party’s presidential primaries/national convention held at the Eagle Square, Abuja.
