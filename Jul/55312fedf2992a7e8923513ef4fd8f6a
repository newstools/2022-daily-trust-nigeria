Wife of the governorship candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Oyo State, Ruth Popoola, yesterday appealed to women in the country to caution their children and husbands against selling their votes to unscrupulous politicians in the 2023 general polls. She urged every woman in the country to go out and encourage their families to get their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) to enable them elect credible candidates in 2023. Speaking during a visit to an Islamic group, Nasrul-lahi-L-Fatih Society (NASFAT), in Ibadan, she said, “I am begging women that have carried pregnancy for nine months and have given birth to children to join us to secure Nigeria. “Now, for those women that believe in vote-buying, I am begging them not to sell the future of their children again. They have to talk to their husbands and children too to shun vote-buying. Nigeria is going through a critical time at the moment. There was a jail break in Abuja last week where many criminals escaped.”
