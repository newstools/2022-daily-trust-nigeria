The Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE) has made a case for e-hailing drivers, saying their margins are being massively eroded because of inflation. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CPPE, Dr. Muda Yusuf, in its half-year business and economic review, identified the e-hailing driving opportunities such as Uber and Bolt among others as one of the biggest employers of youths, including graduates. He pointed out that the drivers have been complaining about unfair practices of the owners of the e-hailing technology platforms. According to him, they have also complained about the increasing cost of vehicle maintenance, high cost of spare parts and the rising cost of fuel, which they said are affecting their margins and welfare. “Their margins are being massively eroded because of inflation and the cost of vehicle maintenance and yet the owners of these platforms have not yielded to the cries of these drivers,” he said. He appealed to the owners and management of the platforms to be more sensitive to the plight of the drivers, encouraging them to have engagement with them with a view to reviewing and making their operating conditions more humane. “Many of them are graduates, they have opted for this service because of the unemployment situation.  It is unfair to take advantage of them. The services should be mutually beneficial and the interest of all players, the owners of the platform, the drivers and passengers must be well taken care of,” he said while he appealed to the owners of the platforms and the relevant government authorities to create a platform for dialogue between the e-hailing drivers.
