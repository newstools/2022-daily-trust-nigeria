Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, has said that most of the All Progressives Congress (APC) senators are with them on the move to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari. Abaribe was responding to the Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who in an interview on Channels Television, said the minority in the Senate cannot have their way in impeaching the President. On Wednesday senators from the opposition parties gave President Buhari six weeks ultimatum to address the rising insecurity in the country or face impeachment. Abaribe said, “I think that some people also sat in Abuja and said that it’s impossible for this insurgents to move from the Northeast. Where are we today? “It’s very wrong for any person to say you don’t have the number. That’s not true. Most of the APC senators are with us. And at the point at which it starts, that is when Nigerians will know almost every senator is fed up. When asked why they wanted to impeach a president whose tenure is almost over, Abaribe retorted, “Do we wait until this administration crushes the country or do we take action to prevent it?”
