The Zamfara governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Dauda Lawal, has congratulated the Osun State governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, on his victory in Saturday’s governorship election. Lawal, in a statement Monday, said he was confident in Adeleke’s ability to deliver good governance to the people of the state. He said the victory was a sign that the people of the state and Nigeria in general still have confidence in the PDP’s ability to provide good governance and render efficient service to the people. “The people of Osun have made a clear choice by voting for Sen. Adeleke of the PDP. I can only assure the good people of Osun that the PDP and the governor-elect have all it takes to wipe away your tears and provide you with the dividends of democracy that have hitherto eluded you. “With Sen. Adeleke on the saddle of governance, I do not doubt that the state will soon witness unparalleled development both socially, economically and politically,” he said.
