The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has faulted David Adeleke, also known as Davido, the nephew of Osun State governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, over the issuance of the certificate of return for last Saturday’s governorship election in Osun state which Senator Adeleke won. Senator Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) defeated incumbent Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The musician had, on his verified Twitter handle, queried why the commission had not presented the winner of the election with a Certificate of Return (CoR) 48 hours after the poll, as provided by law. Replying Davido, the commission, in a statement by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye, said it has up to 14 days to issue the winner with the CoR. “Those that intervene and play roles in the electoral process should try to have basic knowledge of the constitutive legal instruments that guide and regulate the conduct of elections,” he said.
