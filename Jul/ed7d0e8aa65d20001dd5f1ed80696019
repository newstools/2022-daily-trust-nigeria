All is set for the commencement of commercial operations at the multi-billion naira Kaduna Inland Dry Port (KIDP) as Nigeria’s first Domestic Export Warehouse (DEW). The KIDP is targeted at promoting export of made in Nigeria goods and agricultural produce from the hinterland. Daily Trust earlier reported that President Muhammadu Buhari, on January 4, 2018, commissioned the KIDP; Nigeria’s pilot project in dry port operations with the aim of bringing maritime activities closer to the hinterland. Speaking to maritime correspondents in Lagos yesterday, Mr Rotimi Raimi -Hassan, the port’s general manager, said the facility was ready to be launched, while listing support infrastructure already put in place for seamless and efficient operations. He added that about 10 trucks were ready for deployment and that KIDP had judiciously utilised the Export Expansion Facility Grant from the federal government under the office of the vice president to achieve hitch-free logistics. On storage and durability of perishable goods, Raimi-Hassan said a cold room with capacity for 50 tonnes of cargo had been put in place that would serve as a reefer point to keep export cargoes preserved at the required temperatures to meet market demands. The warehouse, according to him, has 4,000 square metres to do aggregation, consolidation and complete packaging of all types of export within the KIDP facility.
