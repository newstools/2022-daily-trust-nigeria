The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has said it will utilise the window of substitution granted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace candidates for Houses of Assembly and governorship elections. The National Organising Secretary of the party, Mr Ifeanyi Mbaeri, said that fresh primaries would be conducted on August 2 and 3, for the election of new candidates to replace those who had withdrawn from the contests.
