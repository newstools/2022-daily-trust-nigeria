The Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Senator Walid Jibrin, has said the party will defeat the ruling APC at the presidential poll and take over all the states being controlled by it in the SouthWest in 2023. Jibrin, in a statement Monday, said one of the factors that would work against the APC was that it had fielded its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima, from the same religion (Islam). The BoT chairman said APC’s campaign would not yield any positive result, adding that Nigerians would prefer the PDP because its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was a Muslim while his running mate was a Christian. He said, “What has happened in Osun State is an indication of PDP’s stand in the whole country. “We as a party have learned our lessons and the Yoruba are beginning to learn their lessons too by coming out to elect Chief Adeleke. We are rest assured that other states in Western Nigeria would be won by the PDP come 2023. “By the grace of God, all the other states in the country will vote for us. So the issue of the APC’s campaign for a Muslim-Muslim presidency will not work.” He added that: “I was there in Osun during the last campaign and the number of people that turned out for the rally was unbelievable, and I was so sure that the PDP would win Osun State.”
