A group, Sons and Daughters of Ikabigbo Community in Uzairue Clan in Etsako West LGA of Edo State, has raised money to support the family of the head of hunters in the community, late Nurudeen Umosor, who was killed during an attempt to rescue kidnapped Rev Fr Christopher Ordia. Fr Ordia of St Michael’s Catholic Church, Ikabigbo, was kidnapped on June 27, and murdered by his abductors who also killed Nurudeen and injured two other persons. The group also raised money for the family of the late Fr Ordia, as well as two other youths who are recuperating in a hospital following injuries they sustained during the Fr Ordia rescue mission. They raised over N4m that was distributed to all the families of the victims. The President of the group, Zibiri Atsaboghena, said, “The family of Nurudeen Umosor got N1m, family of Fr Ordia received N500,000; while Bernard Tenabe and Sadiku Yakubu who were injured got N600,000 and N300,000 respectively.” Presenting the money on behalf of the Ikabigbo sons and daughters to the beneficiaries, he said the gesture was to let the family members know that the community would not forsake them. The group also pledged to support hunters and vigilantes in their determination to protect the community and its people. Meanwhile, the community’s head, Braimah Alegeh, commended the unity and cooperation of the group in letting the victims’ families and injured ones know that they had not been abandoned.
