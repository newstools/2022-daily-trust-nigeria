Three years into its acquisition of 68,000 hectares of land in Tunga, Awe LGA of Nasarawa State, a team from the Dangote Group has arrived at the state capital to begin civil works for the construction of the Dangote Sugar factory. Maryoud Elsunni, member of the two-man team from the headquarters of Dangote Group, revealed this when they paid a courtesy visit to the government house, Lafia on Wednesday. According to him, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Chairman/CEO of the Dangote Group, had directed his contractor to handle the project which, when started, will generate employment for over 1,000 people from the immediate community. “Soon, we will bring some guys here to start. It will create direct employment for the local people. The contractor is coming with some highly skilled personnel but a lot of the workers will be engaged.” Nasarawa State Governor, Engr Abdullahi Sule, said the major reason for bringing investments like the Dangote Sugar Refinery, is to bring wealth to the citizens of the state. “What you need to do is to start with 100 hectares. If the location is good for the production of sugarcane, then you will expand the production from 100 hectares to 1,000 hectares to 10,000 hectares.”
