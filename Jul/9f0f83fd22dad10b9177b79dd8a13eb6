A 25-year-old tsangaya student, Laminu Mohammed, has fabricated a tractor for tilling and planting in Gubio LGA of Borno State. Laminu used components of a Lister water pump to construct the plough/planter. The young man attracted the attention of the Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, who invited him to the Government House on Wednesday in Maiduguri. During a brief interaction, the Tsangaya student proved his skills for the invention after which he was rewarded with N5m. The governor said the money was aimed at inspiring the “unschooled engineer” to produce more ploughs and possibly other agricultural machineries that would serve farmers in the state.
