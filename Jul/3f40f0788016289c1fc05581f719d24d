The Member representing Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency of Osun State, Wole Oke (PDP Osun), has said the emergence of Senator Ademola Adeleke of the PDP as winner of last Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State is a good omen for democracy and the party ahead of the 2023 polls. In a statement yesterday, the lawmaker who congratulated the governor-elect on his victory, said, “It is a good omen of what is to come for Nigeria as a nation at the coming general elections. Osun people spoke on July 16, and God accepted it. “Come 2023, Nigerians will speak again. Many thought victory was impossible for PDP in Osun, but were proven wrong.” Oke said the PDP’s victory was a result of mass mobilisation which resulted in the grand coalition of the people of the state against bad governance and insensitive leadership.
