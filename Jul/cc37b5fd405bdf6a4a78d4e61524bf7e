Ahead of the 2023 general polls, the acting Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, has cautioned politicians in the country against playing politics of religion. Shaibu made the appeal at the weekend when he received the Chief Imam of Benin, Sheikh Abdulfatai Enabulele, and his entourage who paid him a Sallah visit at the government house in Benin.

Shaibu said, “Politicians should avoid playing politics with religion as it will certainly divide us. Let us reject such politicians as they don’t mean well for Nigeria. “The general elections are coming in 2023; we don’t have a choice but to save Nigeria from collapse. This is the time to pray for good leaders that will move the nation forward.” Shaibu, therefore, called on political leaders and the entire citizenry to eschew bitterness and work together to engender sustainable development. While calling on the political leaders to demonstrate the virtue of religious tolerance in the spirit of the Eid el-Kabir celebration, Shaibu said Edo was one of the states in Nigeria where Muslims and Christians lived peacefully and worked together for the development of the state. He said, “If Nigeria emulates Edo, things will work well for the nation. It’s only in Edo State that a reverend father was kidnapped and a Muslim went to the bush to rescue him and lost his life in the process.” He further said, “I want to join the Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Fatai Enabulele, to pray for Nigeria as it needs prayers. It’s only prayers that can change this country for good.” On his part, Alhaji Fatai called on Nigerians to choose competent leaders as the nation prepared for the 2023 general elections.
