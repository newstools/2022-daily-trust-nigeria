Popular Nigerian musician, Davido, has said that he put his music career on the line to ensure the victory of his uncle, Ademola Adeleke, during the recently concluded Osun governorship election. Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had polled 403,371 votes to defeat Governor Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who scored 375,027 votes in the keenly contested election on Saturday. On Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) issued a certificate of return to Adeleke, the Osun State governor-elect. Davido who had played a notable role in Adeleke’s victory in the election had called out INEC for delaying to issue a certificate of return to his uncle, which prompted the electoral commission to issue a reply to him INEC said, “The Commission is not a political party and will not be swayed by partisan political interests. Section 72 of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that a sealed certificate of return at an election in the prescribed form shall be issued within 14 days to every candidate who has been returned by the Returning Officer in an election under the Act.” Celebrating the certificate of return issued to the governor-elect earlier today, the music star said he will now go back to the studio. He tweeted, “It’s been a long battle fought!! We put our Family name on the line, I put my career on the line! But we had faith!! This was God testing us if we really believed in him!! I feel victorious! Congrats! Your excellency @AAdeleke_01! As for me, it’s back to the studio!” See tweet below:
