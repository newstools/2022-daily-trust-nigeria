 The ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERERA) has trained officials from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and other officials from national electricity regulatory agencies across ECOWAS countries ahead of the second phase of the Regional Electricity Market (REM). At the end of a five-day workshop on the development of strategic communication tools in Koforidua, Ghana, Chairman of ERERA, Prof. Honore Bogler, expressed confidence in the capability of the ERERA Communication Specialists Network (ECSN) to help ensure the success of the second and competitive phase of the ECOWAS REM. According to a statement from ERERA, the participants got updates on the conditions-precedent for the launch of the regional market and the directive on the organisation of the market. The directive provides for open access to the regional transmission network and access by eligible customers while a Directive for Harmonisation of Criteria for the Granting of Licences and for Authorisation to Participate in the ECOWAS REM, has been drafted. This instrument seeks to create a framework for granting licences and participatory process for trading electricity across countries in the West African subregion.
