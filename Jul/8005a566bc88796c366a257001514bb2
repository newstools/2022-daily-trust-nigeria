The Minority Leader in the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, has described the outcome of the Osun governorship election, won by Senator Ademola Adeleke, as a sign of the crashing defeat that will be meted out to the APC in 2023. In a congratulatory message to the governor-elect, Senator Adeleke and the people of Osun State yesterday, Elumelu said the PDP has retrieved its stolen mandate in the state. “With the retrieval of our mandate in Osun State, I urge you, Mr. Governor-elect, to use your immense goodwill and vision to further unite the people and commence preparations for a transparent, accountable and development-oriented government that will give the people the breath of fresh air that has eluded them under the abysmal APC administration in the state for the past four years. “Also, this victory and recovery of the mandate that was stolen from you by the APC in 2018 further reinforces your popularity and that of the PDP not only in Osun State, but also in the South West geo-political zone and the nation as a whole. “I pray to God to continue to bless you with wisdom, good health and strength to lead your people at this critical time in the history of our nation. God’s time is the best,” Elumelu said.
