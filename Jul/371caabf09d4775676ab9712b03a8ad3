Premium Breadmakers Association of Nigeria (PBAN), said bakeries and bread outlets would shut down nationwide for four days in a warning strike starting today over the rising cost of materials. President of the Association, Emmanuel Onuorah and Public & Industrial Relations Officer, Babalola Thomas in a statement also asked the federal government to stop charging a 15% wheat development levy on wheat imports. It requested NAFDAC to review downwards the N154,000 penalty charged to bakeries on late renewal of certificates. PBAN also called on the government to grant members access to grants and soft loans being given by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to Minor, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs). The association also called for the stoppage of multi – agencies’ regulation of the breadmaking industry. It said, “Operating a bakery in Nigeria has become near impossible as the incessant increase in the prices of baking materials and diesel rendered the industry comatose. Bakeries are mostly running on huge losses and this is no longer sustainable. “In a move to ensure the survival of the premium bread making industry in Nigeria, we have decided to embark on a withdrawal of services beginning from Thursday 21st July 2022 for four days in the first instance and where no intervention from the government, we shall escalate the duration of the withdrawal.” The group said it has meetings with the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Abuja (FMITI) but without concrete results.
