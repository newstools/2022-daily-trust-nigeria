The governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Kaduna State, Mr Shunom Adinga, says the party has established contact with the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) under Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky to seek their support come 2023. According to him, the reason for contacting the group is to bring its members on board to support the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and other candidates of the party to win the 2023 polls. He said, “We will try as much as possible to bring aggrieved members of the society together such as the Shiite group, which is the El-Zakzaky. We have consulted them. We have had clear understanding with them to collaborate with the incoming government of Peter Obi.” The LP governorship candidate, who disclosed this during a press conference at the party’s secretariat in Kaduna, urged the IMN group and other Nigerians to support his candidature and that of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi. He claimed that no party in the country was as famous as LP because Nigeria had more number of workers than politicians.
