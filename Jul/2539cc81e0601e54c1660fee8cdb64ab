The Labour Party vice presidential candidate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, has said that he and the presidential candidate of the party, Peter Obi, will not bring their relatives into the government if elected in 2023 to lead Nigeria. Baba-Ahmed, who is the founder of Baze University, disclosed this during an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Friday. Obi picked Baba-Ahmed as his running mate on Friday. The former senator was discussing the chances of the party in the 2023 presidential election and its plans if elected to lead Nigeria. He said, “What you see today, what they call due process: bureau for public procurement in 1999, I was behind it. As a young man, I designed it; I wrote it. Only I sponsored the bill against inflated government contracts. “This has destroyed Nigeria in the last 16 years. We have calls against corruption, but when it comes to doing the right thing, they just turn away from it because they are going to benefit from it. “Governor Peter Obi and I are not interested in benefiting. All the people we are going to bring on board, we will not bring our relatives and cousins and nephews to run government. We will not do that. Let Nigerians money work for Nigerians.”
