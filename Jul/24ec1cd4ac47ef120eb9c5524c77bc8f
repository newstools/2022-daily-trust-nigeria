Honourable Samuel Onuigbo has told a Federal High Court in Abuja to stop moves to replace him as the APC candidate for Abia Central for the 2023 general elections. Onuigbo said he won the APC ticket for Abia Central before the moves of the party to replace him with Hon Emeka Atuma at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In the suit, which was transferred from the Federal High Court in Umuahia to Abuja dated June 21, 2022, and brought by his counsel, Emeka Obegolu, the candidate wants: “An order of court nullifying the unilateral substitution of his name as the validly elected candidate for that of the 3rd defendant (Emeka Atuma) who never participated in the primary election of the APC for the Abia Central Senatorial District held on the 28th and 29th days of May, 2022.” He also wants the court to make an order mandating the APC and INEC to immediately include his name as the winner of the primary and a declaration that by the combined reading of Sections 31, 33 and 84 of the Electoral Act, 2022 Article 7 (iv), (viii), (ix), (xi), Qi), (xiii), Articles 19.6 (ii), 20.3, 20.4 of the APC Constitution, and Articles 19, 22(IIKA), 26(k) of the party’s Guidelines for the Nomination of Candidates for the 2023 General Elections, the party cannot validly replace him without his consent in writing. No date was fixed for hearing.
