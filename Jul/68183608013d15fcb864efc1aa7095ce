The orphanages visited are Glory Land Orphanage on New Assembly Quarters Road and Daisy’s Home for Special Children Foundation; all in Igbogene area of Yenagoa. Speaking with journalist after the donations, Ademilua, a native of Agbado in Ekiti State, said it had always been her desire to identify with the less privileged and put smiles on their faces. She noted that identifying with the less privileged made them feel loved and also gave them a sense of belonging, adding that showing love to one another would make the world a better place.
