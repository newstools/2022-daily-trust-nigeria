A governorship aspirant in Taraba State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Danladi Kifasi, has said the party risks not having a candidate in the election. He called on the national leadership of the party to take a decisive step to ensure that the party is not excluded from the contest. Speaking with newsmen in Abuja, on Thursday, the former Head of Service of the Federation warned that if the party is not able to resolve the crisis that trailed the primary election, it may fail to meet up with the July 15 deadline for submission of governorship candidates set by INEC. Controversy trailed the governorship primary election of the APC in Taraba following a last-minute announcement on the mode to be adopted. The chairman of the APC governorship primary election in the state, Lawrence Onuchukwu, had a few hours before the election announced that the direct primary will be adopted. The party had listed Abia, Osun and Benue as the only states that would conduct direct primary for the governorship. Kifasi wondered how the APC came about the candidature of Senator Emmanuel Bwacha for governorship of the state. He also faulted the election appeal committee of the party for failing to reach out to the aggrieved aspirants after an official complaint letter was filed. He, however, advised the APC to explore the consensus option to pick an acceptable and popular candidate before the dateline for submission of candidates elapsed. He said he was the best among the pack to lead the party to victory in 2023, describing himself as a servant leader who will not act like ‘lord and master’ over the people.
