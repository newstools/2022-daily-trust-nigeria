The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commenced moves to halt the gale of defections of its members to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State. The party yesterday held a stakeholders’ meeting summoned for reconciliation with aggrieved members with a view to stopping their defection. Some APC bigwigs recently jumped ship to the PDP for sundry reasons. The party lost Senators Adamu Aliero and Dr. Yahaya Abdullahi as well as member of the  House of Representatives, Barrister Mohammed Bello Yakubu (Relisco), Mohammed Umar Jega and Abdullahi Zumbo. Members of the state assembly, Habibu Labbo, Ismaila Bui and Mohammed Buhari Aliero, equally dumped the party. Speaking during the meeting, the national vice chairman of the party (North West), Salisu Lukman, said the meeting was aimed at addressing the grievances of party chieftains in the state. “Despite the defections suffered by the party, I am still optimistic that APC is the party to beat come 2023. I can see the unity among members is still thriving and this indicates a landslide victory at the end,” he said. He added that the party needed all members to triumph in 2023,  explaining that the meeting was to hear from all aggrieved members for possible solution at the national level.
