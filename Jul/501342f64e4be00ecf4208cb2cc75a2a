The FCT Council of Traditional Rulers has called on residents of the territory to continue to pray for the country to overcome insecurity. The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, made the call when he led upgraded chiefs on a sympathy visit to the released FCT Director of the Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB), Dr Hassan Sule, at his residence in Abaji on Sunday. He said the traditional rulers were shocked and saddened when they received the news of the abduction of the UBEB boss alongside others on board the train by terrorists. He, therefore, urged both Muslims and Christians to continue to pray for the country to overcome the security challenge. Responding, Dr Sule appreciated the traditional rulers and other well-meaning individuals for their prayers, which he said led to his release from the hands of the terrorists. He also called for prayers for others still in captivity for God’s intervention.
