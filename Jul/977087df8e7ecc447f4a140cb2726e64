The Plateau State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has waded into the crises between the executive and legislative arms of Mangu, Jos North and Langtang North LGAs in the past two days. Daily Trust reports that in the last two days the crises between the two arms had led to the issuance of impeachment notice to the chairmen of the three LGAs by the legislative arm.

Part of the statement reads: “The status quo should be maintained in the said local governments, which is that all the actions taken or purported to have been taken against the executive arm should be suspended forthwith. “The APC is a party built on a solid foundation of law and order and has a very strong dispute resolution mechanism which was not deployed or exhausted in these cases. “The party wants to assure the feuding parties and the public that it would dig into the root causes of the disquiet in the affected local governments and any infraction discovered would not go without appropriate sanctions.”
