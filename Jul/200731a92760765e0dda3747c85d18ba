Hoodlums in Karsana, Gwarinpa district of the FCT, on Tuesday, attacked residents after the demolition of over 2,000 illegal shops by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). The hoodlums, who were large in number, attacked the residents, snatching their bags and phones. A police officer, who tried to rescue a lady whose phone was snatched, was almost mobbed if not for the prompt response of FCTA Task Force on City Sanitation. Five of them were arrested and some illegal drugs seized. Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, while speaking to journalists at Gwarinpa, condemned what he called post demolition attacks from hoodlums in Abuja. He said the Tuesday cleanup was the continuation of what the team started on Monday. “The houses that were left untouched were those of the ancient Fulanis that were leaving in Abuja before its establishment. We have been informed by the Department of Resettlement that they have the right of being resettled,” he said.
