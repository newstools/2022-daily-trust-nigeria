At least three people have been killed in a communal clash between Biramafu village and Evungi village in Gbadafu Ward of Gbako LGA of Niger State. City & Crime gathered that the clash, which started on Saturday, was as a result of speed breakers mounted by the residents of Biramafu on the road that connects their village with other communities on the Bida-Mokwa highway. Sources told our correspondent that the action did not go down well with neighbouring villages, who then mobilised and removed the bumps, which led to a clash between the people of Biramafu and the people of Evungi. A source said, “The clash was as a result of speed bumps mounted in Biramafu, which the neighbouring village said were too high and many. So, they mobilised, about 30 of them, and started removing the bumps. The people of Biramafu resisted. This led to them attacking one another with cutlasses. “On Saturday, two people were injured from Evungi and they were taken to a hospital in Bida. “When the two persons taken to the hospital on Saturday were confirmed dead on Sunday morning, another crisis erupted and one person was killed on Sunday at Biramafu. But mobile police and soldiers have been deployed to the area.” Our correspondent gathered that dozens of women and children have fled their homes to Wuya village. Effort to get the reaction of the command’s spokesman, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, was not successful.
