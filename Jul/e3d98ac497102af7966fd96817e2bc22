 Determined to carry out its mandate of recovering the over N29 billion ground rents owed the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) by property owners, the Coordinating Committee on the Recovery of debts has hired the services of five law firms for diligent prosecution of defaulters. The Committee has met severally with the representatives of the law firms, mostly Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs), who have been tasked with preparing legal documents to commence full legal fireworks against the defaulting titleholders. A statement by Muhammad Hazat Sule, the FCTA Director, Information & Communication and Chairman, Media & Publicity Sub-Committee, said Already, letters serving as last warning to such defaulters are being dispatched, as the government is committed to recover every dime owed the Administration. It would be recalled that the FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr. Adesola Olusade recently inaugurated a debt recovery committee with the mandate to recover the outstanding debts owed the FCT Administration with particular interest in ground rents and other sundry fees in the land administration as well as other Land related departments. According to the statement, all property owners owing the FCT Administration must brace up, because a searchlight is being beamed on all defaulters and it is not going to be business as usual.
