While presenting the approval letters to the operators in Abuja yesterday, the Executive Director of NEPC, Dr. Ezra Yakusak said the idea of DEW is expected to significantly reduce the cost of doing business for MSME exporting companies. He said “The federal government through the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has been issuing some directives to agencies in line with ease of doing business. As such, in line with presidential order, the NEPC introduced DEW designated to serve as a one stop transit facility/terminal where pre -shipment activities like packaging, libeling, aggregation and pre-shipment inspection on non-oil export in preparation for transportation and eventual shipment to export destination. Today, four DEW operators and one aggregation centre are being licensed. The Federal Road Safety Corps has approved special plate numbers for all DEW vehicles which has made today’s event unique and historic,” He further stated that NEPC will monitor progress of the warehouses to ensure that they fulfill their established mandate.
