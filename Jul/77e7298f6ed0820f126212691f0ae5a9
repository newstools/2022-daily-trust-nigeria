The National Peace Committee (NPC) has said appropriate procedures should be implemented to ensure that vote-buying does not occur during the July 16 governorship election in Osun State. Chairman of the committee and former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) in a statement yesterday in Abuja, urged the people of Osun State to come out en masse and exercise their civic right to vote without fear of violence, adding that the signing of peace pact by political parties and other stakeholders would take place on July 13. “We particularly urge that appropriate procedures are implemented to ensure the unhealthy and seemingly pervasive practise of voter inducement, commonly called vote-buying does not happen. “The law in all its capacity and requirements should be applied to those involved in such a criminal act, both the buyer and seller,” he said.
