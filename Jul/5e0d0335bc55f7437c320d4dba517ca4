The opposition PDP has unveiled a female running mate for next year’s governorship election in Cross River State. The Chairman of the party in the state, Venatius Ikem, and the state governorship hopeful, Senator Sandy Onor, alongside other PDP stakeholders, formally unveiled a former Channels TV broadcaster, Lady Emana Duke Ambrose-Amawhe, at the party’s secretariat yesterday. PDP youths from Akpabuyo, Bakassi and Calabar South LGAs had last week protested Emana’s choice, saying she was unmarketable and unknown in the state. But Ikem said settling for Emana amid the galaxy of well qualified men was a difficult task, adding that they consulted widely, noting that her choice was divine.
