Owners of undeveloped landed property in parts of the Wuye District of Abuja are advised to quickly develop them or risk revocation. The Coordinator of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), Umar Shuiabu, gave this warning when he led the Ministerial Joint Taskforce on sensitization of Wuye residents ahead of the planned cleanup and demolition of illegal structures in the district. He said: “We have many environmental, security and aesthetic challenges in parts of Abuja, including this area. “Abuja is a planned and a beautiful city with world-class infrastructure not seen in some countries, so we must not give anyone reason to question the sanity of this city. “We have constructed a beautiful road network here but what we can see is illegal use of the road by mechanics and hawkers, among others. This has rendered this road impassable. We want to remove these and give an opportunity to all citizens and plot owners to use the road.’’ Speaking on the risk of revocation of undeveloped plots, the AMMC boss said the FCTA was going to revoke and reallocate to those willing and able to develop the area instead of allowing it to lay fallow. “Instead of developing this land, they leave the land and make it turn into a challenge for the city management. “We have already provided infrastructure and the plot owners have not taken over. We are going to give them final notice and if they don’t develop them, we are going to revoke the allocations and give them to those who are willing to develop.’’ SSA to the minister on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement, Ikharo Attah, said the minister wants a massive cleanup of the entire area.
