Senator Magnus Abe who represented the South-East zone of Rivers State at the National Assembly has said he has left the All Progressive Congress (APC). He however said he is still with the party’s presidential candidate for the 2023 poll, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. In a statement yesterday by his Media Aide, Parry Benson, Abe said, “I am a part of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s political family and I’m also part of his own family, and that is a very separate thing from the politics of Rivers State. “Yesterday (Tuesday), there were some funny letters circulating on the internet, that I have resigned from the APC because Asiwaju refused to intervene in the politics of Rivers State. That is ridiculous; all politics is local. I have no interest whatsoever in the APC in Rivers State. “Nigerians are looking for assurances as to what the future portends as it concerns the Asiwaju presidency, because whether we like it or not, a lot of families are going through difficult crises at this time. I don’t think the biggest concern in any family now is the church that Shettima attends. I think what people want to hear about everywhere now are issues of what is going to happen to security.” Meanwhile, the member representing Kazaure/Roni/ Gwiwa/Yankwashi federal constituency of Jigawa State in the House of Representatives, Muhammad Gudaji Kazaure, has said despite losing his return bid on the platform of the APC and leaving the party, he is still loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement on Wednesday, the lawmaker said he moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC) due to the alleged injustice meted on him by the top echelon of the party inJigawa State.
