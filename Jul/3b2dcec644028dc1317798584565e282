The federal government must go into more diversification in order to ensure quick development of Nigeria, the new Minister of State for Science, Technology and Innovation, Chief Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh, has said. Ikoh disclosed this when he resumed at the ministry in Abuja, a statement by the ministry said yesterday. “Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) is from bottom to up, meaning that the ministry must go into more diversification in order to ensure quick development of Nigeria,’’ Ikoh said. To this end, he called for the maximum cooperation of staff and management of the ministry in order to move Nigeria to a greater height. Chief Ikoh stated that as the immediate past commissioner for industry and Technology in Abia State, he will contribute his own quota by bringing his wealth of experiences in moving the ministry forward.
