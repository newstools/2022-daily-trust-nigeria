Community Planning and Design Initiative (CPDI) Africa, an NGO, has called for standardisation of locally sourced materials for building and architectural designs in Nigeria. Ms Nmadili Okwumabua, founder and Executive Director of CPDI, said this over the weekend in Abuja at a two-day Africa-centred architecture workshop. According to her, “Nigeria has no business sourcing building materials abroad when the country is blessed with all the resources needed for building in the country in different states. “This in turn discourages our local companies which are in the business of producing building and architecture materials. “What we need to do is for our architects and developers to train them in their projects as there is a need for more research efforts to identify, explore and connect Nigerians to Afrocentric architecture and ensure that the government is fully involved in driving growth of the local markets in the building business.”
