 The Kano State chapter of the Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has raised concern that if the purported plan to redeploy Kolo Yusuf as the new Commissioner of Police to the state materialises, the 2023 elections will be marred with irregularities in the state. The council raised the concern in a statement signed by 15 political parties and read by its Deputy Chairman in Kano, Isa Nuhu Danfulani, who is the Chairman of the state’s chapter of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). It alleged that the move to post Yusuf to Kano was part of a grand plan to scheme the electoral process in favour of the ruling APC. The council, therefore, urged police authorities to deploy a senior police officer with a track record of excellence, good character and discipline to Kano as CP. It expressed readiness to work with all security agencies for an enhanced security within the state and beyond.
