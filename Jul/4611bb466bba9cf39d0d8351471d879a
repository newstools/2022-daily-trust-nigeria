No fewer than 10 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) all of them youths, in Ologba in Dekina LGA of Kogi State, have been injured after suspected thugs invaded the venue of their meeting and unleashed “terror” on them. A witness said guns, knives, horns and other weapons were freely used in the process with many properties, including houses, motorcycles and cars were burnt by the invading thugs. “There is serious tension in Dekina LGA. The thugs came to the PDP youth meeting venue at Ologba, burnt properties, vehicles and motorcycles,” said one Ajibili Eshu, a member of the PDP. Meanwhile, a socio-cultural group under the umbrella of Igala Vanguard has condemned the attack and demanded the  immediate arrest of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ward chairman of Iyale, Mr Shagari Ojiji, and Honourable Achile, APC councillor representing the Ward in Dekina LGA. The group’s spokesman, Mr Akpa Ocheni, called on law enforcement agencies to arrest the duo for allegedly leading a politically motivated attack on the opposition party, which resulted in massive destruction. “Igala Vanguard will not accept this politics of violence this time around and all hands will be on deck to ensure that the perpetrators of this barbaric act are brought to face the full wrath of the law,” he said. However, efforts  to hear from the police spokesman, SP William Ovye Aya, failed as he did not answer his calls.
