The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, has been asked to prosecute a civil servant over the allegation of false information. A lawyer, Barrister Victor Giwa, in a letter to the AGF, said the civil servant, Asabe Waziri, misled the office of the AGF into filing a N130m fraud charge against his client, Mr Cecil Osakwe, the managing director of Abeh Signatures Limited, a property company. Osakwe was said to have fraudulently collected N130m from Asabe for a property in the Maitama area of Abuja. In the letter dated July 13, 2022, the lawyer said Asabe has been using the name and the office of the AGF to harass and intimidate his client. He said, “It will be invidious and odious to speculate that Ms Asabe Waziri in conjunction with her cohorts in the Ministry of Justice is using the Ministry of justice to pursue her personal vendetta against our Client all in a bid to embarrass and damage our client’s hard-earned reputation. “However, we are fully aware that you will not allow your office to be used as an instrument for settling personal scores, we further believe you will take the appropriate steps when such anomalies are brought to your attention. “We, therefore, appeal to you that you do not allow Asabe Waziri with her accomplices to abuse the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation by using it to continue to harass and intimidate honest citizens who are using their hard-earned resources to provide the much-needed employment to Nigerians. “We further appeal and demand the following: The withdrawal of the frivolous and baseless charges against our client. “Thorough investigation of the incident with a view to punishing the perpetrators. “Asabe be prosecuted for giving false information to the ministry.”
