Three officials of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Niger State have lost their lives in a motor accident on Lambata-Abuja road. An official of the party gave the names of those who died as Alhaji Baba Umaru (Katcha LGA); Usman Mohammed (Agaie LGA); Adamu Mohammed (Youth Leader, Gbako LGA) and Zakari Ya’u, the driver. City & Crime gathered that while the two party chairmen, the youth leader and the driver died on the spot, the party chairmen of Gbako, Edati and Lapai LGAs sustained injuries and are in a hospital. The party official said, “They were returning from Abuja on Monday after the official unveiling of Bishop Isaac Idahosa as the vice presidential candidate of NNPP. The accident happened around 8pm when a trailer rammed into the officials’ Sharon bus.” Neither the police nor the FRSC responded to an enquiry about the accident by City & Crime.
