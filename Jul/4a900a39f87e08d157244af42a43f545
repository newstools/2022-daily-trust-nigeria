TAJBank Ltd, a leading non-interest bank, opened a technology-powered branch in Wuse 2, Abuja, joining other branches in the nation’s capital as its outlets reach 22 in its two years of operations. Speaking during the event which had traders and small business owners in attendance, the Managing Director/CEO of the bank, Mr Hamid Joda, said: “The opening of the new branch is to continue with our strategy of ensuring that we take the TAJBank brand to all the nooks and crannies of the country with the aim of addressing the service needs of our teeming customers. “We understand that customers want to do business and sometimes someone that can give them that advisory service they yearn for, which in turn will help to address their financial challenges”, he noted in a statement by the bank yesterday. The bank’s board chairman, Alhaji Tanko Gwamma, said the Wuse II district in Abuja is one of the promising locations where businesses thrive. He said the idea of opening a branch there “is to ensure that customers don’t suffer in their banking transactions as TAJBank will not only give them real time service but also give them advice on how to grow their businesses.” TAJBank recently reported a 433 per cent growth in Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the 2021 financial year and significant growth in gross revenue, balance sheet and other performance assessment indicators. The non-interest bank is also set to launch Nigeria’s first private sector Sukuk offering under a N100 billion programme.
