Emotions ran high on Arab Road, Kubwa, a satellite town in Bwari Area Council of the FCT, after a man collapsed and died while jogging on Wednesday morning. City & Crime gathered that effort by the people around who rushed to resuscitate him proved abortive as he died on the spot. According to a footage made available to our reporter by a witness, Samson Emeka, the body of the man, wearing a Juventus jersey and a black pair of trainers, is seen lying on a pavement. Emeka said, “I was jogging on Arab Road around 6.30am when I heard people shouting behind me. When I looked back, I saw a man lying on the ground. The man struggled to regain consciousness, but unfortunately he didn’t and he died.” A police officer at the Kubwa division who pleaded anonymity, said the man suffered suspected cardiac arrest. He said his remains had been evacuated to the mortuary.
