 The Chairman of the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) in the FCT, Alhaji Abubakar Usman, has commended the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for security measures put in place to enable SS3 students to finish the ongoing National Examination Council (NECO) papers across the territory. Usman, while reacting to the closure of schools across the FCT over security threats by terrorists, also commended the FCT UBEB Chairman, Alhaji Hassan Sule, as well as the mandate secretary for education, for their synergy with the FCTA in addressing challenges in the education sector. He noted that the measures taken by the FCTA to close down primary and secondary schools was in the interest of both parents and government. He said, “We as parents believe that the measures taken by the FCTA, giving order to schools to close because of security threats is the best decision, even though I see it as painful, but we have no option than to support such move.” He, therefore, called on parents and residents of the FCT to embark on prayers in order for Nigeria to overcome its security challenges.
