The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has signed a pact with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) to sensitize electricity consumers nationwide. The Chairman of NERC, Engr. Sanusi Garba, said the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) requires more sensitization and Nigerians need knowledge on how they get electricity, noting that the NOA platform is for educating Nigerians on electricity theft, safety and other issues. Engr. Garba who was represented by the Commissioner, Legal, Licencing and Compliance, NERC, Dafe Akpeneye, said: “We have a very large country with a population of 200 million people across 774 Local Government Areas and we are just one agency.” The Director General of NOA, Dr Garba Abari, said in spite of efforts the government has put in place to address electricity gaps, there are still issues and that citizens need to be educated on these efforts. He said, “There is a huge amount of ignorance among our populace on how things are done especially in technical areas like electricity supply. To make citizens aware and participate in the conversation, they need to be sensitised so that there will be understanding from the government, the consumers and service providers to be on a common vision.” The Commissioner, Consumers Affairs at NERC, Aisha Mahmud, said NERC had recently signed an MoU with the federal Competitions and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) on resolving consumer complaints. On this NOA pact whose process began in January, she said: “They have been sending bulk SMS to invite customers to our programmes wherever NERC goes to sensitise consumers,” adding that consumers will be educated on their rights and responsibilities.
