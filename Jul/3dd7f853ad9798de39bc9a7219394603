The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday asked political parties not to ignore people’s religious sensibilities. CAN, in a statement by its General Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola, said the call became necessary, especially in today’s Nigeria “when Christians are becoming endangered species daily. “Our quest is within the constitutional requirements and ignoring it is akin to trampling on the constitution, especially the Federal Character Act.” He further said those presented as church leaders at the unveiling of the vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress “are unknown clerics”. He alleged that desperate politicians who once claimed Christians did not matter in governance and politics went to hire “unknown bishops, pastors and priests” to impersonate the leadership of CAN in their political meeting. He further said, “This is totally unacceptable, reprehensible, unprecedented and ungodly. If they are saying Christians have no electoral values; why impersonating them in their meetings? “We are throwing their principals and sponsors into the court of conscience. These actions of theirs have shown who they are to the public and what they are capable of doing to us all.”
