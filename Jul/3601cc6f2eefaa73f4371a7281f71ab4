Nigerians have been urged to devote more of their energies to humanitarian ventures and activities, which will, in turn, bring about rapid development and reduce criminality in the country. The President, Rotary Club of Garki Neighbourhood, District 9125, Zainab Omowunmi Owonikoko, made the call when she officially took over the reign of the club from the immediate past president, Solomon Bala Okoh, in Abuja. Mrs Owonikoko, in her acceptance speech, expressed gratitude to the entire club members for deeming her fit for the position and pledged not to misuse the privilege reposed on her. She explained that humanitarian organisations like Rotary are in place to join hands with the government to make positive changes in their various communities. Meanwhile, the immediate past president of Rotary Club Garki Neighbourhood, Rotarian Solomon Bala Okoh, said the new president was the prefect leader to spread the word about the good Rotary does in the city and inspire its members to keep going. Rotarian Okoh, who enumerated some of the success stories recorded under his leadership, emphasised the need for robust collaboration among members to sustain the already laid foundation.
