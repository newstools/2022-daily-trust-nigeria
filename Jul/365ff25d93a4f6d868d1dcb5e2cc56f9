 President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the Nelson family over the death of a frontline politician and advocate of the womenfolk, Chief Kemi Nelson. The president, in a statement yesterday  by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, also sent condolences to the government and people of Lagos State, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Lagos APC family over the loss. President Buhari, in the condolence message on behalf of himself and his wife, Aisha, described the deceased as “a consistent and faithful party member who devoted so much to the evolution, development, sustenance and relevance of the party in Lagos and around the country.” The president, who noted the contributions of Chief Nelson as former Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in Lagos State, the State Women Leader, National Deputy Women Leader of APC, and former Executive Director of the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund, said she was such a grassroots mobiliser and an achiever who left her footprints wherever she served. “As the only female member of the Lagos State Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Kemi Nelson continued to be part of the governance structure that led to the transformation of Lagos State into the Centre of Excellence it has become,” Buhari said.
