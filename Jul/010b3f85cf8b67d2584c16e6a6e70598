Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu on Tuesday met the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi at his palace in Ife where he assured that the Commission would be neutral on the July 16 governorship election in Osun State. He urged the traditional ruler to do more in appealing to the politicians and their supporters to shun any act that would trigger violence during the exercise. Yakubu said the commission has put all measures in place to ensure that the Osun people decide who their next governor will be. He said, “Politicians and their followers must give peace a chance for the election to be conducted and concluded promptly during the remaining days of the campaign and after the election.” Responding, the monarch said, “We the traditional rulers share a similar feature with your commission, which is independence and neutrality. We are not politicians and that is why we have control of all our subjects including politicians regardless of their parties.” “I must commend the INEC for their daily introduction of technology into our electoral lives, which has made rigging almost impossible. To cap it all, we now have an electoral act amendment, which complements the advancement of our leadership selection process.”
