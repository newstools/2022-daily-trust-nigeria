The Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Bello, says his administration has strengthened enforcement in the bid to tackle reckless driving in the nation’s capital. Bello made the disclosure when he received the management of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) led by its Managing Director, Mr Buki Ponle, on a courtesy visit. The minister also said the administration’s officials had arrested many offenders. ” Most of the taxis that are in green and white colours in the city are registered, so we have a data base and some of them are uniquely under a specific company.
