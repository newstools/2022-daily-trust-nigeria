The Voice Nigeria Social Justice Community of Practice has called for increased efforts towards tackling social injustice in the country. Stakeholders under the programme made the call Tuesday in Abuja during an engagement forum on social justice in Nigeria. Voice Nigeria is a grant funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and its community of practice is geared towards sharing best practices and cases studies on various social justice themes in the country. Chair of the Voice Social Justice Community of Practice, Olalekan Oshunkoya, said the rate of inequality in the country was so enormous that only a small number of the population benefit from government. Oshunkoya, who is also the lead program advisor, Citizen Commons Advocacy International, said the community of practice was developing a tool kit that would serve as a resource for individuals and organisations within the social justice space to collect and share learnings and best practices. A governance and human rights advocate, Hilary Ogbonna, said to ensure social justice, government needs to tackle insecurity and do targeted spending on the social sector, adding “ If we  don’t tackle insecurity, there wouldn’t be investment, and you need jobs and economic investment in order to solve social injustice and inequality.”
