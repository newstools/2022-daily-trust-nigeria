The Chairman of the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) in the FCT, Christopher Zakka Maikalangu, has dissolved the board of AMAC Investment and Property Development Company (AMAC-IPDC). This was contained in a statement signed by his SSA on Media and Public Affairs, Kingsley Madaki, on Wednesday. The chairman explained that the dissolution was part of his government’s measures to review and revive all the companies and agencies belonging to AMAC. Meanwhile, the chairman vowed to deal decisively with any staff aiming at sabotaging efforts of the council in scaling up its internal revenue generation. He gave the warning on Wednesday while addressing heads of units and staff of the revenue department of the council. Maikalangu also frowned at the lukewarm attitude of some revenue consultants.
