 The Chairman of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC), Fatai Ibikunle, has urged Nigerians to vote leaders with capacity to address the country’s numerous challenges during the 2023 polls. Speaking at a forum of youth professionals in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, yesterday, Ibikunle said the problems facing the nation knew no religion, ethnicity or region. According to him, the talks about Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC for the 2023 presidential election had become a distraction “taking away the eyes of the Nigerian players from the ball.” He said those who were stoking the debate against the ticket were enemies of Nigeria. He noted that rather than engaging in debate about the capabilities of the two names on the ticket, the enemies were “weaponising” religion to deny Nigerians the opportunity of being served by a capable team of leaders.
