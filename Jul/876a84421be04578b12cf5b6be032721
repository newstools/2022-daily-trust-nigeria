Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State yesterday said he and his counterpart in Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, are committed to working together for the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections. Ortom, who was featured on an Arise Television programme, “The Morning Show”, yesterday, however, asked the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and the National Working Committee (NWC) to pacify Wike ahead of the 2023 polls, noting that it would give the party a smooth sail in the polls. Wike contested the PDP presidential ticket but lost to Atiku at the primary, as he came second. He equally showed interest in the party’s vice presidential slot but Atiku picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate. Ortom said following Atiku and the party’s decision to settle for Wike, it was incumbent on them to pacify Wike for easy progress of the party without impediment ahead of 2023. Ortom further said Wike was key to the survival of the party when others left to join other political parties and must not be treated as if he did not matter anymore. He said, “The way to go is for the presidential candidate of the PDP to reach out to Wike. Wike was instrumental to the sustenance of the PDP. He was the anchorman. He was also instrumental to my return to the PDP the moment I decided to leave the APC when it started dancing in the wrong direction. “Wike and I remain committed to the victory of the PDP at all levels. Once Wike is pacified, we can all work together for the victory of the party. “Wike stood with us at the worst moments of our lives. I don’t like betraying people. When Benue was being devastated by herdsmen, Wike stood with us firmly all through and is still standing with us.”
