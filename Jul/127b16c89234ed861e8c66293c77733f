Suspected political thugs on Tuesday attacked operatives of the Osun State Amotekun Corps at their Isale-Osun base in Osogbo, the state capital. The incident happened at the time the governorship candidate of PDP, Mr Jackson Adeleke, was campaigning in the area. A member of the Amotekun Corps, who preferred anonymity, said the thugs were working for PDP. The Commander of the Osun Amotekun Corps, Chief Amitolu Shittu, while confirming the attack, described it as unfortunate. He said, “We appeal to all political parties in the state to see Amotekun as an outfit that belongs to all. Amotekun has helped PDP, APC and other political parties without being sentimental or bias. “We have protected Osun Groove, churches, mosques, night clubs, business centres, government and private farms, among others. The beneficiaries of Amotekun should not wage war on the outfit that has helped them in the past. It’s our responsibility to protect lives and property. We are not partisan.”
