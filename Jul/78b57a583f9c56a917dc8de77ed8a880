People of Idofian community in Ifelodun LGA of Kwara State have protested against alleged imposition of one Jamiu Olarewaju Adedamola Omikunle as the traditional ruler of the town. The aggrieved indigenes stormed the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftain Affairs in Ilorin, accusing the commissioner, Architect Aliyu Saifudeen, of working with fifth columnists to impose a new traditional ruler on the town. The protesters, comprising youths, women and community leaders, warned the state government not to set the community on fire over the plan to install the “wrong candidate”. Carrying placards, the protesters sang solidarity songs to express their displeasure. They claimed that Adedamola was neither from the town nor belonged to any of the ruling houses and demanded the reversal of the decision. Spokesperson of the protesters and one of the kingmakers, Mallam Akolade Ibrahim Abioye, said, “The kingmakers notified the commissioner about three of the selected aspirants in writing. “But to our dismay, the commissioner invited and held a meeting with two out of the seven kingmakers. “From all indications, this is nothing but bias and injustice against other aspirants, and the action of the commissioner indicates he is working to install Adedamola to the detriment of other aspirants.” In his reaction, the commissioner, denied involvement in the selection process and appealed for calm over the issue. He insisted that some elements were trying to tarnish his image with the development. He said, “One thing I can assure you here is that all the people that were presented to us have the endorsement of the kingmakers. “But if the kingmakers present somebody who is not a prince, that is left for them to resolve with the community.” The stool of the Onidofian of Idofian became vacant in June, 2021, after the death of Alhaji Zubair Agboola Oyesoro from the Oloyi ruling house.
