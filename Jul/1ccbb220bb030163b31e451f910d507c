Stanbic IBTC Bank has restated its commitment to providing quality service to its customers with the PlusRewards loyalty scheme. The loyalty programme provides exclusive discounts and offers to enable cardholders to purchase items at select merchant stores across the country. Some of the merchant stores include Jed Mega Stores Ltd, NCN Happy Home Global Ltd, Heroes Garden, Soul Interbiz (AK Collections), Aero Logistics and Travel Ltd, Balcony Regency Suites, The View Hotel and Suites, Chard Pharmacy Ltd, and Hawthorn Suite by Wydnham International Hotel and Suites. Others are Rodina Hotel and Suites, MedPlus Pharmacy Ltd, Waxit Spa, Classy-Chi Devine Cosmetics Nig Ltd and others. These merchants offer services that cut across logistics, hospitality, fashion, beauty, wellness and health care. Speaking on the rationale for the programme, Wole Adeniyi, Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Bank, said the PlusRewards scheme gives all Stanbic IBTC cardholders access to exclusive offers and discounts at participating merchant stores so they can explore, shop and purchase goods for less. “We will continue to offer discounts and solutions to customers because we always put our clients first in whatever we do. At the various locations, we offer varying percentages of the items purchased or services rendered. “Our customers and clients are our first stakeholders, and as a customer-centric organisation, we have initiated this programme to maintain and strengthen our relationship with our customers,” Adeniyi said.
