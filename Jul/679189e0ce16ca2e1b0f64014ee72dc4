Candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) during the 2020 governorship election in Edo State, Mabel Oboh, has decamped to the party from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Oboh had after the governorship election decamped to the ruling PDP in state. Oboh in a statement Saturday in Benin, said the passion to serve Nigerians brought her back to the ADC. She said, “After the 2020 Edo State governorship election in which I was privileged to fly the party’s flag, I sought to explore another platform to pursue my passion for service. “But, in the short period I have been away, it became obvious that the ADC is home to me and an avenue to realize my passion.” She said going back to the party she had once nurtured is a home coming for her as it aligns with her principle of willing to ensure development and bring dividend of democracy to the people. She added, “On July 22, 2022, I formally left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It took some time to reminisce on the basic principles of ADC, which align with my ideals of what politics should be. “As a grassroots political party, ADC had the philosophy and policies that align with my principles and aspirations.”
