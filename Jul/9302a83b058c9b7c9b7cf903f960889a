A member of the House of Representatives and Leader of the Tinubu Support Group (TSG), Hon. James Faleke, has appealed to Christians in the country not to lose sleep over the emergence of two Muslims as presidential candidate and running mate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 poll. He spoke yesterday in Abuja, during a meeting organised by Tinubu Media Team to eulogise his role in Asiwaju’s victory at the party’s presidential primary election. NLC proposed protest unconstitutional, a recipe for anarchy — FG Negotiate for your members, ASUU tells SSANU, other unions Faleke said the sentiments by the Christian community is understandable, but that Nigerians must learn to move away from religious politics. He said, “What is important is that when we are seated here, we don’t bother as to Christians should sit here and Muslims should sit on the other side and when we board a plane we don’t bother to ask whether the pilot is a Muslim or Christian likewise when we go to markets; we don’t care from whom we are buying. “So what we are saying is we brought people of pedigree. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has the pedigree and wire withal and had never discriminated against Christians or even a tribe. “I am a living example; I am a Christian and I am representing him directly. When it comes to tribe, I am not from Lagos; I am from Kogi State; so he is the type of person we want. “If you talk about religion, if Asiwaju has not Islamised his wife; we don’t see how he can Islamise Nigeria. His wife is not only a Christian; he even allowed the wife to grow to become a pastor. “If there is no enabling environment for her in the home she won’t become a pastor. Those are the issues we should talk about. Asiwaju was the one who handed over the missionary school in Lagos to the owners when he came onboard, so you can imagine all those issues.”
