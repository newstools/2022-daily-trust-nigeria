The Managing Director of the Cross River State Water Board, Victor Ekpo, says a N1.2 billion debt being owed the board by customers has affected its service delivery to the people. Ekpo, who stated this while addressing newsmen in Calabar on Tuesday, also spoke on a wide range of issues affecting the water corporation and his plans to resuscitate the organisation. He stated that the debt covered between January, 2020, and March, 2021, and had made it impossible to replace broken pipes, fix generating sets and buy chemicals for water treatment. He expressed regret that prominent citizens of the state, particularly politicians, formed the major people that were indebted to the board. He stressed that since the debtors refused to pay despite several persuasive means, the corporation would adopt the option of publishing their names to compel them to pay. (NAN)
