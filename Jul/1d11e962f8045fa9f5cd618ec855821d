Prince Tonye Princewill, an ally of a former Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). This came less than 48 hours after Mrs Ibim Semenitari, another associate of Amaechi, tendered her letter of resignation to the party. Princewill, a former governorship candidate of the defunct Action Congress (AC) in Rivers State, in his letter of resignation addressed to the APC Ward 3 chairman in Buguma, Rivers, cited the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as the reason for his resignation. Princewill, who appreciated Amaechi in the letter, said he could not defend the decision of his party to field a Muslim-Muslim ticket against what he described as protestations from well-meaning Nigerians across religious and political divides. The letter reads in part: “It sets a very wrong precedence. It is totally insensitive, and even if you win, will prove bad for good governance. Under these dire circumstances, I find no justification to still remain, in good conscience, a member of a political party that subordinates electoral victory over the safety of lives and the peace of mind of its citizens. “The men and women of our party here in Rivers are the most loyal and faithful supporters I have met. They know right and they know wrong. And they know me. I enjoyed working with them and I’m so sad to leave. But a party that totally disregards the basics of the same equity we preach is alien to me.”
