Adekunle Akinlade, the gubernatorial candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) in the 2019 election in Ogun State has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Akinlade, who was former governor Ibikunle Amosun’s anointed candidate, had a fierce battle with Governor Dapo Abiodun, as the APC candidate in the last election. He lost the APC governorship ticket to Abiodun and dumped the party for APM where he contested the election. He returned to the ruling APC after he lost the gubernatorial election to Abiodun. Again, the former House Representatives member popularly known as Triple A, contested the APC’s governorship primary held in May and lost to Abiodun. He expressed a lack of confidence in the governorship primary committee led by Wale Ohu. In a letter addressed to the state chairman of APC, Akinlade hinged his resignation on the failure of the national leadership of the party to intervene in the internal crisis in the state. He said he could not “in good conscience continue to participate in a process that is characterised by injustice.” “As a principled and forthright individual, I cannot in good conscience continue to participate in a process that is devoid of justice,” he said. Akinlade, however, was silent on the party he would be joining after dumping the ruling party. But there are strong indications that he may pitch his tent with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.
