Speaking, the House Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu (PDP Delta) said, Nigerians should work for the unity and security of the country. According to him, the media would do better for the country if it desists from manufacturing none existing situations that will raise tensions in the country. Speaking, the Chairman, House Committee on Water Resources, Sada Soli Jibia (APC Katsina) said, it was unfortunate that, some people including journalists are reporting the said Bill without an informed view. According to him, many Nigerians raising their voices against the Bill and misleading others have not read and understood its content to make an informed comment or analysis.
