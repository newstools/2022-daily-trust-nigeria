Students of universities and polytechnics in Plateau State have been trained on goat production by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). The training, according to the scheme, was to make the students self-reliant and create wealth and jobs in the various communities.

Mrs Ane Eyo Ita, Rural Employment Promotion Officer of the scheme said, “The trading is an economically viable venture. That is why this department came up with this novel idea to train participants on goat production because it has a lot of employment potential-from the production of meat to milk, even up to the waste. “I want to urge the participants to take this training seriously so that they can become self-reliant and even employers of labour. Ibrahim Ardo Abdulazeez, the state coordinator of the scheme, in his opening remarks said after one week of theoretical training, the training would continue for about six months where the participants would be given the practical aspect of the goat production, adding that after the training, they would be given talks on business management. One of the beneficiaries, Miri Nangwang, appreciated the scheme for organizing the programme, saying the training would expand his knowledge. He expressed hope that at the end of the training, there would be financial assistance to help with the take-off of the business.
