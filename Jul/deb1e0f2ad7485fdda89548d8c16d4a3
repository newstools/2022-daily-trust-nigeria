The Kano State Consumer Protection Council (KSCPC) has confiscated 487 sacks of expired flour at a warehouse in Dawanau Market in the state metropolis. The acting Managing Director of the council, Dr Baffa Babba Dan’Agundi, disclosed this after the evacuation of the flour. Represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Consumer Quality Assurance, Alhaji Salisu Muhammad, Dan’Agundi said some good citizens of the state tipped the council with the information about the flour which was brought to the market. He said the council confirmed that the flour was expired after having laboratory test of samples. In a related development, Dan’Agundi said the council had confiscated many cartons of different kinds of soft drink at the Muhammadu Abubakar Rimi Market, Sabon-Gari, that were found to be expired. He said the expired flour and drinks had been evacuated and taken to the council’s warehouse. He, therefore, called on the public to always check on products’ information before using them.
