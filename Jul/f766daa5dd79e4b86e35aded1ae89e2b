With Nigeria facing constant disruption to provide adequate power supply to its citizens, the Sahara Group has said Nigeria’s power sector can only be stabilised through the provision and adoption of power mini-grids in the country. The Director, Governance and Sustainability, Ejiro Gray, during a courtesy visit to Media Trust Group, publishers of Daily Trust Newspapers and owners of Trust TV Monday in Abuja, said the lack of infrastructures has made it costly to operate in remote areas that are not connected to the national grid. Gray noted that with 45 per cent or 80 million Nigerians not having access to electricity, alternative sources of energy need to be considered to power every home across the country. “We must address those needs while talking about any energy transition plans or strategy. That is where you have things like mini-grid for renewables coming in because if you want to expand the national grid to some of these very remote areas, the cost is too much and at the end of the line, you will have losses that will be too much for any electricity generating and distribution companies to bear alone.” She, however, disclosed that the company is trying to solve power challenges in the country with the launch of Gree’n’lectric, a publication that sought to inform the public about its activities in providing sustainability in the power sector. She added that the company would soon commission a 5 megawatts solar power plant in Maiduguri, Borno State, with Yola Electric the major off taker. While commending Daily Trust for holding on to the principles of professionalism in producing its stories in the face of numerous challenges in the media landscape, she called for collaboration among all stakeholders for Nigeria to adopt green and clean energy in electrifying the country. On his part, the General Editor of Daily Trust, Malam Hamza Idris, assured the delegation that the company is ready to partner and use all its media platforms to amplify the activities of the company.
