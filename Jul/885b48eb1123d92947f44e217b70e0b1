The Asiwaju Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation has unveiled a 65-man think tank that will formulate the expectations of Nigerians into a workable action plan if the former national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, wins the 2023 presidential election. Speaking at the inauguration of the team, the Director General of the campaign organisation, Adebayo Shittu, said it would be chaired by a former governor of Edo State, Oserheimen Osunbor. Shittu said Osunbor would be assisted by two serving vice-chancellors, retired military generals and several professionals from all walks of life. He said the mandate of the team was to seek from Nigerians their expectations from the Tinubu presidency when it resumes in government. The team, he said, would then formulate these yearnings and expectations into a workable and implementable action plan seeking to return to Nigerians a realistic hope that guarantees progressive change and transformative governance. “We trust that once the right policies are evolved and implemented, the restive youths in particular and all Nigerians, in general, would ensure and be assured of a peaceful, secure, collaborative progressive and prosperous Nigeria,” he said.
