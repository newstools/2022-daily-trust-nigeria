The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Ilorin Central Jummat Mosque has appealed to wealthy indigenes in the emirate to prioritise the maintenance of the ultra modern edifice. The Secretary of the BoT, Alhaji Shehu Gafar, made the appeal during a meeting of the board and stakeholders in Ilorin. The mosque was renovated and upgraded to a world class facility in 2011. While thanking those who have consistently contributed towards the maintenance of the mosque, Gafar urged other wealthy indigenes of Ilorin to emulate them
