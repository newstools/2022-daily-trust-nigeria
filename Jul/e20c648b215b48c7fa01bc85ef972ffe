Nigeria’s leading airline, Air Peace, has concluded plans to extend its wings to Guangzhou, China, and Mumbai, India, with scheduled flight operations this month. The airline has also disclosed that Israel will soon join its international network. Spokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, said the airline will be launching its initial one weekly flight to China on July 13, 2022. This would be followed by two weekly flights to India also before the end of July, with the hope to increase the frequencies when operations garner momentum. Olisa stated that these new destinations were a further testimony to the airline’s determination to connect Nigerians seamlessly to other parts of the world and deepen socio-economic ties between Nigeria and both countries. He stressed that Air Peace’s entry into both countries would strengthen their bilateral ties, adding that China and India are not new terrains for the airline. He said, “Guangzhou and Mumbai are not new terrains for Air Peace as we have operated a number of special/evacuation flights into both cities in the past. So, we are very familiar with the airspace and plans to launch Tel Aviv, Israel, are in top gear. This is also not a new space for us as you know; we have operated flights to and from the country. The airline further stated that it would continue to provide peaceful and strategic network connections, in line with its no-city-left-behind mantra, which the airline is aggressively implementing. He added that the airline also has in the works two other African destinations – Malabo in Equatorial Guinea and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It would be recalled that in March 2022, Air Peace launched its Niamey route, and a few months before then, it flagged off Douala operations from Lagos and PH.
