The Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria (REAN) is collaborating with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on testing of renewable energy devices. This was disclosed by the president of REAN, Dr Segun Adaju, at a media parley organised by the association in Abuja yesterday. The collaboration, according to Adaju, is to ensure the standard and certification of products before use. “We are in collaboration and engagement with Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on testing. They just launched a testing centre in Lagos, so that any product that is coming in would be tested. What we are seeing is that people are now gravitating towards certified products,” he said. Adaju listed access to finance as one of the major challenges the renewable energy industry faces in the country. “Access to finance is across the value chain, right from project developers and members of the community, who say it is not affordable. The good thing is that there are models that are creating that affordability right now and gradually over time we should overcome them,” he said.
