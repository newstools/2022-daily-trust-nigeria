Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Sule, has cautioned critics of his administration against comparing his three years in office with the eight years of the previous administration. The governor, who hosted his deputy, Dr Emmanuel Akabe, and members of the State Executive Council (SEC) on Sallah homage in Gudi, Akwanga LGA, however, said the APC would win the 2023 polls. He said, “We have already gathered enough patience and we did that intentionally, because time will come where patience will no longer be interesting. There are times to scream, there are times to make noise, there are times to show strength, there are times to show resources and that time is coming. “That is why any time people are trying to make comparisons, I say compare my three years with the three years of other administrations. Don’t compare my three years with eight years of service. Don’t compare my three years with four years of service, but compare my three years with three years somewhere.” He further said, “Our party is APC; we must work for APC. If somebody is hiding somewhere and using somebody’s name to do other things, they are on their own. I will never tell anybody go and do anti-party as the leader of this party. “I am for the party and I will continue to support the party and I will do whatever it is to continue to support the party. “We must try everything possible to win our elections because if somebody else wins and you want to come to me to change the election, I will not change it, even if it’s my election.”
