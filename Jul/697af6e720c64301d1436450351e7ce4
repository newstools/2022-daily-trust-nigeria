Property owners whose buildings were demolished by the Osun State Government during a road construction nine years ago barricaded the entrance of the Government House, Osogbo on Thursday, demanding compensation. The property owners said the protest became their last resort as Governor Adegboyega Oyetola had failed to fulfill his promise to pay their compensation valued at N1bn. Speaking on behalf of the others, Alhaja Sola Adefunke said many of the affected landlords had died while many were sick and needed money for treatment. She appealed to Governor Oyetola to pay them without further delay. According to her, “We are here to demand our compensation. Before the demolition they carried out valuation and promised to pay us, but they haven’t. Aregbesola begged us and assured us that he would pay, but he deceived us. When Oyetola became governor, he told us that he would pay our compensation but he hasn’t. That’s why we are here today.”
