The Senior Pastor of Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Daki-Biyu District, Kubwa Branch, Abuja, Alex Ogundipe, has called on Nigerians to get their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) so as to change leaders who have not met their expectations in the forthcoming elections. Ogundipe made the call yesterday while speaking with journalists shortly after the 17-year Founder’s Day celebration of the church. He said the best way to change a government or those holding elective positions that were not performing was to go out en masse to cast votes for preferred candidates, while noting that members of his congregation had been sensitised to get their PVC.
