 The National Chairman of Ulama’u Council of Jama’atu Izalatil Bidi’a Wa’ikamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS), Sheik Sani Yahaya Jingir, has called on Muslims across Nigeria to cooperate with security agencies to tackle the current security challenges in the country. Sheik Jingir made the call yesterday during the two raka’a prayer of this year’s Eid el-Kabir held at the Bauchi Road Motor Park, Jos. According to the cleric, fighting insecurity and other challenges should not be left in the hands of government alone as people have a great role to play in tackling the security challenges bedeviling the country, calling on people to avoid committing crime and other forms of social vices. He said, “People in their respective communities should help security with necessary information to trace criminality in the nooks and crannies of this country. What is happening now is beyond imagination. We have to rise up to the occasion and rescue this country together.” He also called on Nigerians not to continue to abuse their leaders, noting that doing so would escalate the problem, advising all and sundry to pray for the leaders and peace of the country.
