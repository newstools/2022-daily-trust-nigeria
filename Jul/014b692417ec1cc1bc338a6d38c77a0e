The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to stem the tide of vote-buying by politicians in the country. Speaking during a valedictory programme/media briefing yesterday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Barr Mutiu Agboke, said vote-buying remains the major headache for INEC. He warned politicians to desist from the act in future elections, saying anyone arrested for buying votes during elections would be prosecuted. The REC assured that the commission would ensure transparent, credible, free and fair general elections in 2023 and appealed to security agencies and the political class to continue to join hands with it to tackle the menace of vote-buying in the country. Agboke said the commission has given the electorate in the state value for their votes by ensuring that their votes counted during elections in the state. He said though the people of the state initially doubted the commission’s sincerity in making their votes count, INEC’s credibility was enhanced in all ramifications. He, however, urged residents of the state to collect their Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs), which he said are key to the participation of any voter in the upcoming election, adding that “the current voting system is such that without a PVC, no electorate shall be allowed to vote under any condition.” He said, “INEC has phased out the use of Smart Card Readers and Incident forms.”
