Mr Sylva Okolieaboh, a director at the Treasury Single Account (TSA) department, has replaced Chukwuyere Anamekwe as the acting Accountant General of the Federation (AGF). In May, Anamekwe was appointed to oversee the accountant general’s office amid a probe into allegations of N80 billion fraud linked to Ahmed Idris, the former AGF who was suspended by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed. However, a few weeks ago, reports emerged that Anamekwe was under the radar of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over corruption allegations, a possible reason why he has been replaced. Meanwhile, the federal government has begun hunting for a substantive accountant general. In a circular titled: “Commencement of the process of appointment of a substantive Accountant-General of the Federation”, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs Folasade Yemi-Esa, directed permanent secretaries to forward details of eligible directors on Grade 17 to her on or before 4:00 pm on Wednesday, July 6, 2022. “Those who have attained the position of Substantive Director (Grade 17) on or before January 1, 2020 and are not retiring from the service earlier than December 31, 2024 are eligible to participate in the selection process while officers undergoing disciplinary proceedings are excluded,” the circular stated.
