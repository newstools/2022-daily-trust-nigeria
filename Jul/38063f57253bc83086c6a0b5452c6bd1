The presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is unveiling his running mate for the 2023 poll, Senator Kashim Shettima, today in Abuja. A statement yesterday by the APC National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Muhammad Argungu, said governors who are members of the party and other critical stakeholders are expected at the event to be presided over by the party’s national chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu. The choice of Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate has triggered heated debate on the grounds that the two of them are Muslims. But in a statement yesterday, the Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO) Director, Media and Communication, Bayo Onanuga, said religion or ethnicity were far from the calculations of the party and its presidential candidate, Tinubu, in the choice of Shettima.
