The senatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Alhaji Mubarak Ahmad Tijjani, has said the party is championing the cause of Nigeria’s rebirth. Tijjani, a pilot, businessman and politician, who spoke exclusively to Daily Trust on Tuesday, said the NNPP was a mass movement which would bring about the desired change in the country. He, therefore, urged the youths to see 2023 as the opportunity to take over the leadership of the country using the platform of NNPP. He said, “This era is the era of youths. They have been telling us since we were children that we are the future leaders, we are leaders of tomorrow, and we have never seen that tomorrow. So I want to be the door opener to that tomorrow.” He said as an estate developer in the FCT for over 15 years he knew the challenges residents faced and that he was better placed to tackle them.
