A former senator representing Rivers South East, Magnus Ngei Abe, has taken a swipe at the Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for addressing the PDP governorship candidate as the next Governor of Rivers State. The governor had said that following the performance of his administration, any candidate of the PDP would win the 2023 governorship election in the state. But Senator Abe, in a statement yesterday by his media aide, Pastor Parry Benson, said the people of Rivers State would decide who would become the next governor; not Wike. He said, “If the President of Nigeria, who is more powerful than the governor, cannot decide who will be the next president to succeed him, then the Governor of Rivers State cannot decide who will succeed him.”
