 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has set up a panel to reconcile all aggrieved members in Kaduna State ahead of the 2023 elections. Daily Trust reports that Governor Nasir El-Rufai and his Deputy, Hadiza Balarabe, attended the panel’s inaugural meeting yesterday convened by Salihu Lukman, APC National Vice Chairman (North West). However, the party’s governorship candidate in the state, Senator Uba Sani, and other aspirants, including Alhaji Sani Sha’aban and a former Assistant Comptroller General of Customs, Bashir Abubakar, were absent. Sha’aban, a former House of Representative member, rejected the consensus process through which Uba Sani emerged. He petitioned the national headquarters of the party and instituted a legal case against Sani’s candidature. Fielding questions from newsmen yesterday in Kaduna, Lukman said those absent got notice of the meeting very late, noting that they informed the party that they would not attend the meeting. Lukman said another reconciliatory meeting would be convened to resolve their grievances and ensure that they worked for the party’s success at the polls.
