The vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Kashim Shettima, has said the womenfolk should expect a better deal if he is elected on a joint ticket with the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in 2023. Shettima spoke yesterday in Abuja during the inauguration of Arewa Women for Tinubu (AWT). Shettima, a former Governor of Borno State, acknowledged the role of Nigerian women in politics, describing them as the largest voting bloc. He said, “Subsequent governors of Lagos State had their deputies as Sarah Adebisi Sosan who served with Babatunde Fashola, Princes Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire and lastly Dr Oluranti Adebule. “I want to assure that the next administration by God’s grace, would be women-friendly and ensure that the reward system is put in place whereby our women are adequately rewarded, compensated and elevated. “On my part, I think I was the only governor in the whole Northern region that had four women as commissioners in the cabinet.” Meanwhile, a pro-Tinubu group has vowed to deliver 15 million votes to the joint ticket. The group, tagged, BAT Project 23, revealed this during its official inauguration at Ake Palace in Abeokuta, Ogun State. The National Coordinator, Hassan Makinta, said, “This organisation, under my rule, is ready to give BAT an estimated 15 million votes. We have taken it upon ourselves to deliver this mandate.”  By Adam Umar & Peter Moses (Abeokuta)
