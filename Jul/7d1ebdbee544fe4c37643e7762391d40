A political pressure group, Fusion774, has called on the federal government to strengthen local security outfits in communities within and outside the FCT in order to put an end to the rising insecurity challenges. The National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Sadiq Jitka, suggested this during a press briefing in Abuja, said they decided to express their concern because of the rising state of insecurity in the country which had become a major concern to every Nigerian ahead of the 2023 general elections. Jitka explained that if local security and vigilante groups were equipped with sophisticated weapons to defend their communities, they would be able to counter any security threat. He said, “We condemn all acts of criminality in the country. We stand to condemn the recent Kuje jailbreak by the ISWAP terrorist group, leading to the release of suspected dangerous elements into our society, thus further heightening the insecurity precipitation. “We urge the government to live up to its responsibility and double its effort to stem the tide. In this political transition period, political parties that want our votes should convince us with their roadmaps, manifestoes and issue-based discussions; not trivialities.”
