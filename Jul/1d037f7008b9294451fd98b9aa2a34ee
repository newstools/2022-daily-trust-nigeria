Nigeria is targeting to be part of the International Energy Charter (IEC), a global community that will enable it to attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to accelerate power sector development. Speaking at the National Energy Summit (NES) in Abuja on Tuesday, the Director General, Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, said the community has a common agreement on investments and dispute resolution on country-specific investments which Nigeria could benefit from given the confidence investors have in the charter. Bala said: “When investors come in they need legal instruments; in case of disputes they can easily settle it. If Nigeria belongs to the international community through the IEC, a community where common rules are, it makes it very easy for people to come in and invest. “Certainly, we need a lot of investments to ensure that we have enough electricity, more fuel.” On the theme, ‘Green Economy and Sustainable Energy Development in Nigeria: Investment, Opportunities and Challenges’, Bala said it was apt as the world intensifies a transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy to tame global warming. Secretary General of the IEC Secretariat in Brussels, Belgium, Guy Lentz, said Nigeria could drive more investments in energy by becoming a member of the charter’s treaty. Lentz said: “There is a lot of capacity in Nigeria like wind, solar and biomass. All these energy sources will be developed; and to achieve this, the country needs mostly private investments. To attract private investments, Nigeria needs to have a solid legal framework, which is the energy charter treaty.”
