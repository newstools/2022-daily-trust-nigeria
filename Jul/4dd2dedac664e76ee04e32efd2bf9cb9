The Special Adviser to Bauchi State Governor on State and National Assembly Liaison, Alhaji Sani Mohammed Burra has denied having a hand in the attack on state assembly lawmakers. Hoodlums numbering about 50 had stormed a guest house located on Sir Kashim Ibrahim Road, a few metres away from the Bauchi State Government House and attacked the lawmakers who were holding a meeting on Monday. The hoodlums reportedly injured six members, smashed cars and windows of the houses turning everything in the house upside down. The Deputy Minority leader of the Bauchi State House of Assembly, Baballe Abubakar Dambam and other lawmakers, however, accused Burra of being behind the crime. Dambam, in the company of other lawmakers, told newsmen that “We suspected Sani Burra because the hoodlums attacked us 30 minutes after he left us at the guest house.” But the governor’s adviser in an interview with newsmen has denied the allegation that he had a hand in the attack, describing the allegation as false. He said, “I wish to make it abundantly clear that I’m not aware or behind the purported attack.”
