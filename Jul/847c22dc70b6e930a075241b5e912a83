The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, Senator Uba Sani, has announced the state’s deputy Governor, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, as his running mate for the 2023 governorship election. Daily Trust reports that Balarabe, who became Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s running mate in 2019 after his then deputy, Architect Barnabas Bala Bantex, declared for the senate seat, had in March declined the offer when it was first made to her by Governor Nasir El-Rufai. In a social media post on Monday night, Sani wrote, “After consultations with critical stakeholders of Kaduna State, I am happy to announce that I have picked Her Excellency, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as my running mate in the 2023 governorship election in Kaduna State. “Dr. Hadiza Balarabe has contributed immensely to the giant strides recorded by the Mallam Nasir El-Rufai’s administration in infrastructure and human capital development. “Dr. Balarabe has demonstrated hard work, punctuality, dedication and team spirit in the discharge of her responsibility as Deputy Governor which has endeared her to the critical stakeholders in the State. “I wish to therefore call on the good people of Kaduna State to support the choice of Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as my running mate. I also enjoin them coming out en-masse to vote for our ticket during the forthcoming 2023 general election. Your mandate in 2023 will enable us to build a peaceful, prosperous, and greater Kaduna State. “Together, we are determined to make the State a reference point for good and responsive governance.”
