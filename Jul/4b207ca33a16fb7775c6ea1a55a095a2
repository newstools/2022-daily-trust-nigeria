The City Sanitation Squad of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Thursday said the on going sanitation around Utako, Jabi parks, Wuye District and its environs was a ministerial directive to tackle environmental degradation and other illegalities in the districts. City & Crime reports that the sanitation that started on Thursday morning has resulted into displacement of several illegal car marts, mechanic workshops, worship places, roadside traders and a notorious scavengers’ colony. Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, said the minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, who recently inspected activities around these Districts, was saddened that the administration’s favourable disposition to the rule of law has been greatly abused by residents. Attah noted with dismay that the residents had taken for granted the administration’s decision to use stakeholders engagement and respect for human rights in dealing with developmental issues before any enforcement. He bemoaned the activities of some lawless persons that are gradually turning the Utako and Jabi parks areas to places that can jeopardise the health and security of the city. Attah, who also lamented that even the scavengers that took over a nearby undeveloped plots around the districts, have added farming of cannabis to their other illegal activities. According to him, the sanitation would remain the priority of the administration until total sanity was restored and the environment reclaimed for better developmental projects. Attah said, “What is going on here is a total clean up in Utako, Wuye and Tunde Idiagbon connecting point . The minister gave us the order and we started the joint operations this morning (yesterday).’’
