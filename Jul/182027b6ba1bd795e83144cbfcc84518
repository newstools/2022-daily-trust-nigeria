Osun State Governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has reiterated his commitment to deliver on his five-point agenda, including settlement of pensions and gratuities. Adeleke, in a statement by his spokesman, Olawale Rasheed, described as fake a report alleging that he had reneged on his promise to clear the backlog of salaries and pensions during a Channels TV interview. The statement reads in part: “This is a lie from the pit of hell, as Senator Adeleke throughout the interview never at any point disowned his promise to clear outstanding workers’ salaries, pensions and gratuities, and better the lives of all Osun people. “Contrary to the frustrated mind of the deceitful author, the governor-elect explained in detail how he will source fund to meet the needs of workers including his unique promise of reviewing issue of leakages in state finance and redirecting security votes to meet urgent state needs.” He further said that during the interview Adeleke reiterated his pledge to address workers’ welfare which was number one on his five-point agenda and affirmed that payment of workers’ entitlements would not be recorded as an achievement as a labourer deserved his/her pay. He added that, “On the larger governance issue, the governor-elect touched on his plans for education, security, job creation, agriculture, infrastructure, debt management and other germane issues. A people still in shock at their defeat probably could not concentrate on the full interview to watch a governor-elect displaying his clear grasp of issues and his preparedness to hit the ground running.”
