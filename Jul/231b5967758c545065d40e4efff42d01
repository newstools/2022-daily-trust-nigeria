 The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has said it will work with the Republic of Botswana, to create a favourable business climate for the ease of doing business for more trade investment activities in Nigeria. The Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), Dr Jumoke Oduwole, stated this on Tuesday, during a virtual trade promotion meeting with private and public business owners in Nigeria and Botswana. “We have states that are doing incredibly well in attracting and poaching private sector manufacturers. Companies in Botswana would do well to just look at all the companies here and see how we can collaborate particularly as we charge for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),” Oduwole said. She said PEBEC would continue to institutionalise the reforms it had been able to institute in the last six years to enable a business-friendly environment for traders. According to her, “Our ease of doing business reform efforts demonstrates in clear terms our readiness to support our ambitions with all the political will available. “It’s a journey of collaboration. It’s taken a lot of partners across government across the private sector and now hopefully across countries with Botswana, to make sure that businesses are able to thrive. It’s the journey of continuous improvement. There’s so much more work to do. But we remain optimistic.” Chief Executive Officer, Botswana Investment and Trade Centre (BITC), Mr Keletsositse Olebile, while calling for effective collaboration between both countries, said there are a lot of business opportunities in Botswana. In their opening remarks, the High Commissioner, Botswana High Commission in Nigeria, Pule Mphothwe and the High Commissioner of Nigeria to Botswana, Wosilat Adedeji, lauded the initiative, which would strengthen the trade ties between both countries.
