He said, “We will not give them (APC and PDP) that access; we will not allow them, and the people who will ensure we win in 2023 are you people. “We will not deceive you; our job is to work and convince the people to vote us into office. If you agree to vote me, also agree to other LP candidates. Vote LP from bottom to top. “We can change our situation if we all agree to do so. You have done one particular thing for a number of years and it has not worked, why don’t you try something else? “LP that you see today is the party of the ordinary people; it is the party of the pensioners, party of the civil servants, party of the market women and traders. The party that takes pity on the ordinary people, the party that will bring you out of the present situation you find yourselves.” The state Chairman of LP, Ibrahim Idoko, called on the people to support the party in its quest to take over the state and Nigeria.
