A chieftain of the APC and member of its National Executive Committee (NEC), Yekini Nabena, has defended the choice of the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Kashim Shettima. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja, Nabena, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, said the choice of the two Muslims was better than the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) jettisoning the zoning arrangement between the North and the South. He said Nigerians should be more worried about reasons the PDP killed fairness and conventional power rotation between the North and the South and not a Muslim-Muslim ticket of the ruling party. He explained that there were Muslims in the North and the South, adding that the choice of two Muslims by the APC was in the national interest, noting that they had the capacity to fix Nigeria. Nabena said, “Nigeria should worry more about the zoning which the PDP has just killed for their selfish interest and desperation of its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, because for Atiku it is the last chance which will become one-chance for him by 2023. “The APC has done the right thing by zoning the presidency to the South. Nigerians must know that religion is a matter of individual race, the most important thing is that the presidency is in the South compared to PDP’s unfair treatment to the South.”
