 The Nasarawa State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said it has joined forces with the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) during the 2023 general elections. The state’s Chairman of PDP, Mr Francis Orogu, disclosed this yesterday to newsmen after a meeting with the party’s stakeholders in Lafia, the state capital. He said the meeting was to strategise on how the party would be victorious in next year’s polls. He noted that, “If the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, with his incumbency power, could be defeated, then I think defeating Governor Sule will not be difficult.” He, however, urged the party stakeholders and supporters to work tirelessly to ensure the victory of the party.
