The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has told workers involved in Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State to stick to the oath of neutrality they swore to and ensure the success of the election. Fifteen parties are involved in the election, which pundits have narrowed to a two-horse race between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement on Friday, Yakubu charged those involved in the election to uphold INEC’s Code of Conduct, display sense of commitment and professionalism. Yakubu also urged them to remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. “The people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls.” “They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process,” Yakubu said. He recalled that exactly 27 days ago, INEC conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive. According to him, the feat was an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. He said, “The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the commission to achieve these lofty goals. “As you are aware, the Osun State Governorship election will hold on Saturday. I have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. “We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.”
