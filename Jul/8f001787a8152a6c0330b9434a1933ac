A 37-year-old employee of a table water factory in Kwara State was burnt to death on Wednesday night when his vehicle caught fire and exploded. The victim, Emmanuel, popularly known as Baba Ibeji, was a driver with Softfort Table Water on Obanisuwa Street, Egbejila, Airport Road, Ilorin. He was said to be driving back to the factory from a petrol station when the car with Reg No: LSR966GD went up in flames. The deceased’s boss, simply identified as Mr Surajudeen, said the incident occurred around 9pm when the three jerry cans of petrol in the car exploded due to lack of proper ventilation. A witness said, “We didn’t notice the vehicle was on fire because it started from the back seat. Baba Ibeji was a very jovial person. When he was coming, the gate of the factory was opened and we saw him waving with a phone in his hand. It was those at the rear who saw the fire that alerted us, but it was too late.” Confirming the incident, the Fire Service spokesperson of the state, Hassan Adekunle, said firemen later retrieved the remains of the casualty from the vehicle.
