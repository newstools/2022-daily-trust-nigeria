 The Kano State chapter of the Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) has asked Nigerians to vote the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29, 2023. The group’s Director General, Contact and Mobilization, Sheikh Ahmad Rufai Al-Saddik, spoke yesterday during the inauguration of the Kano State executives to steer the campaign activities of the LP presidential flag bearer ahead of the 2023 poll. Al-Saddik said Nigerians have suffered enough in the past, adding that the time to change the tide is now with LP in the villa. He said, “Enough is enough, let’s make sure we reclaim and take over Nigeria. We have suffered enough that we can’t afford to miss out on voting for the right man to rescue Nigeria.” When asked how Obi will beat presidential candidates from the North and especially the PDP’s Atiku Abubakar, Al-Saddik said, “the difference is clear. They have been tried and they failed over time. “ On his part, the state coordinator of the group, Aziru Muhammad, who spoke on behalf of the inaugurated executives, expressed their readiness to do all in their capacity to deliver.
