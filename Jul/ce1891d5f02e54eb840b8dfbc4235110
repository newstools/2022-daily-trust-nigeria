The Federal Government has urged truck owners to build parks in the country in a bid to stop the incessant parking of trucks on highway corridors. The Director of Highway Construction and Rehabilitation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Engr. Folorunso Esan, who made the remark at the weekend said it is not the responsibility of the federal government to provide truck parks.

Esan stated that truck owners should come together as an association to address the situation and could fetch then revenue if they consider the proposal. “Those who are operating trucks are supposed to provide where to put their trucks. Government is not duty-bound to give truck parks to truck owners because they are in business, so they are the ones who should look for where to park their trucks. They have associations, so they can come together to build parks for themselves and generate their own revenue. So it is not all the time that they have to wait for the federal government. On how the government is solving the menace,  he said the government is engaging the appropriate authorities to curtail it, particularly, the state governments and the National Association of Road Transport Owners  (NARTO). He said the road, which is being financed through the Tax Credit Scheme by the NNPC, is going on as planned and commended the contractor for the quality of work done. On his part, the Director, Highway, North-West, Engr. Adebayo Taiwo described the Zaria-Funtua road project as impressive. He said the contractors had to work hard considering their full mobilisation in order to meet up the target.
