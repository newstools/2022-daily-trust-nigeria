The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned against selling of rams in non-designated areas in the capital city, Abuja. Mr Ikharo Attah, the Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement, issued the warning while inspecting the designated areas on Thursday in Abuja. Attah said the administration would not allow persons selling rams to litter the city with the animals, while warning that anyone caught selling ram in areas not approved the animals would be confiscated and the culprit prosecuted. According to him, “The position of the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, has remained the same in the last three years, and even tougher this year. The minister said there is nothing wrong in bringing rams for sale in Abuja during this global festivity. “But what he finds inappropriate is, and has kept telling each and every one of us, that we should not allow selling of rams in non-designated areas, particularly in the city centre. “Except at spots that are already earmarked for such purpose like the abattoirs, the ram markets at Dei-Dei, Kugbo and some other few ram markets.” He disclosed that the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), headed by Mr Osi Braimah, had set up a committee to check the sale of rams this year.
