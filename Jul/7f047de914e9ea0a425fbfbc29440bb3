 Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said Senator Adeleke earned the victory through his steadfastness, hard work and commitment to the welfare of the people who had spoken loud and clear. The governor in a statement by his spokesman, Nathaniel Ikyur, said, “The victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Adeleke in the Osun election is a measure of trust and confidence of the citizens on him and the party. “The election of Adeleke is a precursor to the sweet round of victories awaiting the PDP as we begin to take back all the states in our resolve to rescue Nigeria from the destruction meted to it by the clueless APC-led federal government.” The governor applauded the people of Osun State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the media, civil society organisations (CSOs) and security operatives for ensuring that the will of the people prevailed. He however advised Adeleke not to take the trust and confidence for granted. He asked the governor-elect to carry everybody along in the scheme of things, noting that the people expect him to change the narrative by bringing positive change to the state of Osun.
