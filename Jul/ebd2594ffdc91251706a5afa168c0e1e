A two-year-old girl, Tina Thompson, has been declared missing in the Arab Road area of Kubwa, a satellite town in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. In an interview with City & Crime, her parents cried out to the authorities in Abuja to help recover their daughter. Tina’s father, Michael, a staff of the Ministry of Health, said at about 2pm on Wednesday, his 12-year-old son, Ebuka, and eight-year-old daughter, Blessing, returned from school and went to their mother’s shop at the Kubwa Village Market and were asked to take their younger sister, Tina, to their uncle’s house for lunch; a distance of about 10 metres as it had been the routine for the children each time they returned from school. He said few minutes after they left, Ebuka rushed back to their mother asking why she should send a friend to offer them some money and stick sweets and take Tina from them. He said, “It was at that point that their mother realised there was trouble and immediately contacted me. We rushed to the Kubwa police station to report the case. “I cannot say if it is kidnap, abduction, stealing or anything. Tina is just two years old; so who did I offend? I appeal to those holding our child to please return her.”
