The United Towns Agency for North-South Cooperation (UTA), a United Nations accredited non-governmental organization, will soon commence humanitarian activities in vulnerable rural communities of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Nigeria’s President of the UTA, Princess Abigail Chinyere Amalaha, stated this yesterday during the organisation’s inaugural news briefing in Abuja. She said the organisation would be focusing on scaling up access of FCT rural communities to safe drinking water, qualitative healthcare and education. She said it was worrisome that several rural communities in the FCT lack basic social amenities, adding “We cannot fold our arms and leave everything to the government .” She said the first set of rural community projects will be construction of two modern hospitals, rehabilitation and equipping of two primary schools.
