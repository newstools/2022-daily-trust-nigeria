The national leadership of New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) has said the Bauchi State Chairman, Malam Sani Shehu, remains the authentic chairman of the party in the state. A statement in Abuja yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary of NNPP, Dr Agbo Major, dismissed the purported suspension of Malam Shehu. “Shehu’s purported suspension by the North East Zonal Secretary, Babayo Liman, of July 13, 2022, without the consent and approval of the party’s zonal chairman, Kawu Ali, and the National Working Committee (NWC) is a flagrant violation of NNPP’s Constitution. “Accordingly, it is set aside, null and void, and of no effect. NNPP believes in due process, the rule of law and strict adherence to its constitution registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),” Major said in the statement. He further stated that the party warns its officials at all levels to desist from taking any action that will cause disaffection and division among members. He added, “We jointly strategise, mobilise Nigerians and move into the 2023 general election that will redefine the destiny of the nation and create a new Nigeria citizens desire and deserve.”
