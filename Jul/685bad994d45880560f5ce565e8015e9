The new Minister of Transportation, Alh. Muazu Jaji Sambo has assumed office as he warned the ministry staff to avoid being troublemakers and support him to drive president Muhammadu Buhari’s vision in the ministry. He assumed office alongside the Minister of State, Transportation, Ademola Adegoroye. The minister, who addressed the permanent secretary and the directors in the ministry shortly after he received his handover notes from the outgone Minister of State, Transportation, Dr. Gbemisola Saraki, said he is coming to the ministry with an open mind. “It’s a pleasure to be here. I would like to say it’s a pleasure to be back home. I started my life in the maritime industry, NPA precisely in 1984 and I went through other sectors of the economy and ended up in the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA),” he said. “I want to tell you that I am here only for a very short time. I don’t want to cause problems for anyone. I don’t want anybody to also cause problems for me. I will not look for your trouble but if you look for mine, I will give you tenfold. That is me but we can live together for 50 years without a quarrel if you know me. So, I am coming with an open mind” he told the management staff. On expectations, the minister said: “We will look for the low hanging fruits and make sure that we put them on the table as quickly as possible.”
