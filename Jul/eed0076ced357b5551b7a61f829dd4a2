The police commissioner, while extending his condolences to the beneficiaries of the deceased, noted that the money presented was in no way a payment for the lives and services of their loved ones. “It is a way to show them that the force remembers the labour of their loved ones in life and death,” he said. He, therefore, urged them to make meaningful use of the benefits to make life better in the absence of their benefactors. One of the representatives of the beneficiaries while expressing his appreciation to the force, through the commissioner of police, promised to make judicious use of the token. He prayed for God’s blessing on the command and the Nigeria Police Force.
