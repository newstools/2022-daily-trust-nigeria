The Managing Director of The Kano Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA), Baffa Babba Dan’agundi, has admonished parents to desist from giving underage children vehicles to drive, especially during the Sallah period, as any child caught driving would be arrested, fined and have the vehicle seized. The warning was contained in a statement issued by the agency’s spokesman, Nabulusi Kofar Na’isa. He said underage cyclists were liable to fine and punishment under Section 16, Sub-Sections 4, 7 and 8, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of KAROTA Laws 2012. The statement added that as part of effort to ensure free flow of traffic in the state, KAROTA has concluded plans for the deployment of no fewer than 1,500 personnel across the state during the Sallah to ensure effective control and free movement for all road users.
