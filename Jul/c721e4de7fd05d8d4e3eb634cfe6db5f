The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has said the party’s victory in last Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State is a sign of what will happen in the 2023 general polls. PDP’s candidate polled 403,371 votes to defeat APC’s Oyetola, who trailed behind with 375,027 votes. Senator Adeleke won in 17 local government areas against Oyetola’s 13 before he was returned elected by the Chief Returning Officer for INEC, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos. In a statement yesterday, Ayu said the election was a “referendum on the disastrous stewardship of the APC and proves conclusively that Nigerians want PDP back and indeed, PDP is coming.” The PDP helmsman commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies for toeing the path of neutrality and ensuring that votes counted. “We call on all PDP members and all Nigerians to join the moving PDP train. Don’t be left behind. Our next destination is villa. “With PDP, Nigeria shall rise again. Indeed, she is already rising. Osun people have spoken. The rest of Nigeria shall speak with a resounding voice on 25th February 2023. “Four years ago, the PDP won the governorship, but our candidate, Sen. Adeleke, was robbed of victory in broad daylight. We went back to the drawing-board, and today, we have reclaimed our victory,” he said. However, efforts to get the APC reaction to the development proved abortive as the party’s national publicity secretary, Barr Felix Morka, neither answered his calls nor responded to a text message sent to his phone as of the time of filing this report.
