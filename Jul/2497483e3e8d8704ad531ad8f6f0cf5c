Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said people should not complain about Muslim-Muslim ticket because this is not the first time that Nigeria will have such a situation in place. The governor said this on Channels Television while commenting on the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC,) Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s choice of Kashim  Shettima as his running mate. Sule argued that majority of governors in the country rode on Christian-Christian tickets to power but nobody is complaining both that. He said, “This is not the first time that we have had a president and his number two of the same faith. All people need to do is to go back and look at history of Nigeria. This also is not the first time that we have had elections where somebody from the south west will pick somebody from the north east both of the same faith. As a matter of fact, they won their elections. “If you look at the number of governors that we have and the number of deputy governors we have, we have almost 64% who are Christians and the remaining are Muslims. Over 60 percent of governors and their deputies are actually Christians. “The whole southern part of the country you have 17 governors; only one of them is Muslim. Nobody is complaining about that. Look at all the southern governors of PDP; none of them is Muslim.”
