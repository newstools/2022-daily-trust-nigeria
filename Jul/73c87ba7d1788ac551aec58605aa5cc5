Speaking at the event which was held in Igangan, Ibarapa North LGA, Omodewu said as a leader of the party in the state he had been appealing to aggrieved members of the party, adding that his appeal had been yielding results. He welcomed the PDP members, saying they would work together to defeat the PDP led-government in the state. He said, “We are here to ensure that we unite our people. This mammoth crowd is defecting to our party from PDP. We have been appealing to them to stay in their homes. They don’t have anything to do outside the party when we are working hard to return to the Agodi Government House in 2023. “For those contemplating going to another party, no place like home. Let them stay in their house. As the chairman of the party in the state, I will continue to appeal to them to stay in the party. If you see what is going on here, you will see the need to unify our people. Our chances in the 2023 elections are very bright and that was why our primaries were much tensed.”
