Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State has described the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as the Vice-Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a masterstroke. In a statement issued Tuesday by his spokesperson, Ismaila Uba Misilli, the governor said choosing the former Borno state governor will facilitate the party’s smooth sail to victory in the forthcoming presidential election. He noted that as a committed and loyal party man, Senator Shettima is a great asset to the ruling APC and will add immeasurable value to the presidential ticket. “Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will not have made a better choice. Shettima is a highly cerebral, eloquent, competent, courageous and cosmopolitan leader who has succeeded in building bridges, reputation and friendships across the country; and I believe he has the capacity, acumen and political sagacity to deputise the Jagaban Borgu,” he said. While congratulating the one-time Chairman of the Northern Nigeria Governors Forum, Governor Yahaya said with his background as former lecturer, banker, agricultural economist, ex-governor and parliamentarian with visionary and patriotic ideologies, Shettima will be a ‘round peg in a round hole’ as a vice president. According to him, the Tinubu/Shettima ticket is an excellent combination that has already given APC an upper hand and set the opposition off-balance, “as we approach the elections.” He reassured of his personal commitment and support of the APC in Gombe State to the Tinubu/ Shettima ticket, as well as victory for the party in 2023 elections.
