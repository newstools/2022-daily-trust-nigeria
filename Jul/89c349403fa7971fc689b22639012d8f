A staunch supporter of the minister of Information and Culture, Kayode Ogunlowo, has said he is working for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the state ahead of the 2023 general poll. Ogunlowo, hitherto, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was hosted by a former Senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki, in his Broadway GRA residence in Ilorin on Wednesday. The development sparked reactions in Kwara political circles after the pictures of the event went viral in the state. But speaking with Daily Trust on the  issue, Ogunlowo said he decided to work for Alhaji Shuaib Yamman after he picked the PDP ticket. “I didn’t leave Alhaji Lai Mohammed for Saraki. He is my leader and remains my leader. But the situation in Kwara now is different. “What prompted my move, among others, was that Yamman had been somebody I had worked with while we were in APC and I was surprised that he got the ticket against our expectation. That showed that things have changed with Saraki. And then he, Yamman, invited me to come and work with him.”  “The calculation on ground now is that APC is divided and PDP is the only party that has the structure to compete against it, unlike the SDP, which is even still having its own troubles and struggles,” he said.
