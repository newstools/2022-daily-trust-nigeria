The Kwara State chapter of the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBC), on Sunday, lamented the continuous increase in the prices of bread ingredients. The situation, the body noted, might force another increase in the price of bread after a similar increase about two months ago in the state.

Speaking on the development, the Chairman of AMBC, Kwara State, Alhaji Abdulfatai Alaba, in a chat with Daily Trust, said bakers in the state were helpless and confused over the situation. He said: “We are in a very critical situation in this country with the continuous increase in the prices of ingredients. We are yet to get to terms with the first increase about two months ago, and now the situation is even worse. “Some bakers who want to remain in business are now cutting corners in quality; which is injurious and dangerous. A bag of flour that was sold at N26,500 is now N28,500. “We increased the price of bread when flour was N25,000, then and we were all crying, what about now. Same thing with butter from N17,500 to N21,500, and sugar is now N28,000 from N25,500. The prices of yeast and nylon have also gone up, coupled with the lull in the market. “With the situation of things, we may be forced to increase bread price again as painful as that decision may be because we don’t have a choice unless the government takes a decision to stop this daily increment; it is killing businesses.”
