The National Population Commission (NPC), on Wednesday, held a town hall meeting in Gwagwalada Area Council in the FCT to intimate stakeholders on the importance of the coming trial census and the need to support the process. The meeting had in attendance religious and community leaders, representatives of market women and traditional rulers, among others. Addressing the participants, the Federal NPC Commissioner for the FCT, Joseph Kwali Shazin, said the meeting was necessary because that was where the stakeholders resident in the areas of the trial census would be able to dialogue with officials of the commission to work out the success of the exercise. He called on those present, including representatives of the Ja’amatu Nasir Islam (JNI), the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), political leaders and youth groups from the various council areas, to cooperate with the enumerators for the success of the exercise. Shazin said population explosion and inaccurate data were clogs in the wheel of development in the country, adding that “our work is to assist the government on how to manage this population.’’
