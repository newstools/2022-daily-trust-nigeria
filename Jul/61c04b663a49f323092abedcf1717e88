The Kirikiri Lighter Terminal (KLT) Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), on Thursday, said it generated over N23 billion as revenue in the last six months. This was even as it noted that the Russian-Ukraine war accounted for the low importation in the period under review. The terminal also intercepted N212.8m worth of codeine-based cough syrup and Hyergra. Customs Area Controller of the command, Hammi Swomen, who made this disclosure to newsmen in Lagos, said the revenue generated by the command had a surplus of N8.950m, which represents about 38 per cent increase in revenue collected in the first half of the year. Swomen said apart from the codeine and Hyergra, the command also seized a container of 795 packages of prohibited footwear falsely declared as water taps and closets.
