The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara State, Mallam Garba Attahiru Madami, has said there are over 165,000 unclaimed PVCs in the state. Madami revealed this while speaking with Daily Trust on Thursday about the preparations for the 2023 elections in the state. According to him, “We discovered there are over 165,000 unclaimed PVCs in Kwara, and for this reason, I have to devise ways to make collection less cumbersome. “So, I directed that all the names and VIN of the unclaimed PVCs be typed out and pasted on our notice board for those affected to come and check before we schedule them on when to collect them. “Ilorin West alone has over 42,000 unclaimed PVCs, and we typed out the entire names. After the decision, over 680 were collected last week from the 50 or 70 per week before.”
