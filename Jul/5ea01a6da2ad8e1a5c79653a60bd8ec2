The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has cautioned youths in the country against allowing themselves to be used for political violence in next year’s general elections. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara State, Mallam Attahiru Garba Madami, made the appeal Thursday in Ilorin at a symposium tagged, “Youths and 2023 General Elections: Your Concern, My Concern”, held at the NUJ secretariat. He said the youths should channel their energies to the progress of the country and their future. Represented by the Deputy Director, Voter Education, Dr Adesina Tayo, Madami said, “It is common knowledge that youths are often used as thugs to perpetrate violence before, during and after elections, which is a concern to all and sundry.” Similarly, the Tangale Community Overseas (TCO) of Gombe State has asked youths to shun political thuggery in 2023. Lamela Umaru Lakorok, general secretary of the group, charged youths to maintain peace and order before, during and after the elections.  From Mumini AbdulKareem (Ilorin), Mohammed I.Yaba (Kaduna)
