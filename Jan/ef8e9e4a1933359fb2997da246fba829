Chairman of Katsina State Football Association, Alhaji Aminu Balele Kufi, has expressed dismay and disappointment in Nigerians who have continued to blame President Muhammadu Buhari for Super Eagles loss at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations. It will be recalled that before Nigeria’s Round of 16 clash with Tunisia on Sunday, President Buhari in a video chat with the Super Eagles lauded the players and technical officials on their group stage heroics and charged the three-time African champions to go for victory against the Tunisians. Unfortunately, the Super Eagles ran out of luck as their campaign ended abruptly following their 1-0 defeat by the North Africans who qualified as best losers from Group F. Consequently, some Nigerians have since blamed the shocking defeat on the telephone conversation between the President and the team before the kick-off of the must win match. In his reaction, kurfi who is a member of the NFF Technical Committee chided such Nigerians as he said they were simply transferring needless aggression. “For me, blaming Mr. President for Super Eagles loss is unnecessary and ridiculous to say the least. Those making such childish comments are barking at the wrong tree. I do not see any connection between the Presidential chat and Super Eagles’ defeat. “Honestly, Mr. President squeezed out time to talk to the team despite his crowded schedule, so he should be commended. Nigerians shouldn’t take such Presidential support for granted,”
said the former chairman of Katsina United. He said instead of crying over spilled milk, Nigerians should find time to pray for the Eagles to have better luck in their future engagements. “The Super Eagles didn’t perform badly. It was simply a bad day for them. When luck is not on your side, there is nothing you can do. “Instead of trading blame over the defeat, I urge Nigerians to pray for the team to have better luck in future. We shouldn’t expend too much time and energy on what has happened already,” said Kurfi.
