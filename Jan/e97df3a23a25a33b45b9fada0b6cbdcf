The Gas Aggregation Company Nigeria Limited (GACN) has commissioned a primary health centre it renovated at Damangaza community in the Lokogoma area of Abuja. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative was financed through voluntary contributions by staff and other volunteers as an emerging model in supporting public health. Speaking at the hand-over ceremony, the Managing Director of GACN, Lekan Ogunleye, said the company was following the example of operating environment solidarity set by its shareholders – especially the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) by positively touching lives. While appealing to the community to put the facility to judicious use, he urged corporate entities to adopt and renovate similar infrastructures consistent with GACN’s model. He said: “I plead with Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and the management of this primary healthcare centre to ensure the facility is maintained and used judiciously. “We should go back to being our brothers’ keepers and support the federal governments’ effort to create a balanced society with appropriate safety nets thereby catering for all.” The Etsu of Damangaza, James Budebo, while commending GACN for the gesture, promised judicious use of the facility and assured that it would be secured. On his part, the doctor in charge of the centre, Dr Adams Jacob, said: “I never envisaged that this centre would be transformed to this amazing level. We will use it judiciously.”
