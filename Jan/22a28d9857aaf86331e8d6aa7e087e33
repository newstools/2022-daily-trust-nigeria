After a decade of banning the use of motorcycles for either personal or commercial reasons in Yobe due to the insecurity challenges faced by the state in the hands of Boko Haram insurgents, Governor Mai Mala Buni announced the lifting of the ban from zones of A and B respectively. During the governor’s supervisory visit to Nguru Local Government Area, where he consoled victims of the recent fire incident, he disclosed good news of returning the usage of motorcycles across the two zones. The people of Yobe State jubilated and extend good wishes to the governor for this commendable decision which is what the people have been looking forward to. Unquestionably, Governor Buni deserves such honourable gratitude as the uplifting of the ban from using motorcycles will open job opportunities and ease the activities of people and restore the livelihoods of hundreds of youths who lost their commercial motorcycles after the storm of insecurity that led to its ban. Nonetheless, Governor Buni has been working untiringly to mobilize security agencies to ensure the safety of Yobe State people from the insurgent. The lifting of the ban reassures the people that the governor is focused on diverting insecurity and reducing unemployment. Kasim Isa Muhammad writes from Potiskum, Yobe State
