Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, on Sunday, paid a condolence visit to Alhaji Ahmadu Haruna Zago over the death of his elder brother, Alhaji Shuaibu Haruna Zago. Daily Trust reports that the deceased died in the late hours of Saturday in Kano and was buried today (Sunday), according to Islamic rites. The Governor visited Danzago at his residence in the Kurna area of Dala Local Government Area of the state, with his entourage which included Abdullahi Abbas. Abbas is the chairman of Ganduje’s camp of the All Progressive Congress (APC) while Danzago is the chairman of the Ibrahim Shekarau‘s faction of the party. Daily Trust reports that there has been a division in Kano’s chapter of APC since after the state congress which produced two factional chairmen. However, a Federal High Court in Abuja has ruled, three times,  in favour of the Shekarau’s faction which produced Danzago as the Chairman of the party in Kano. Ganduje has been visiting his political opponents in recent times. He had paid a similar visit to Senator Rabiu Kwakwanso, his predecessor and estranged benefactor. The age-long relationship between Kwankwaso and Ganduje turned sour shortly after the latter took over the mantle of leadership in Kano. On the last day of 2021, Ganduje had said 2022 will be a year of reconciliation.
