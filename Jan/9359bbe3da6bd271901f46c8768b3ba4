The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said the new Ossiomo Power Plant will supply 24-hour electricity to the Benin airport and the Nigerian Air Force Base in the Benin metropolis. The plant is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative with 40 megawatts (MW) capacity. The governor, who spoke to journalists in Benin, said his administration is already working to connect the airport and the NAF Base to the Independent Power Plant (IPP), noting that power connection to the NAF Base will be done in two phases. The CCETC-Ossiomo IPP is already providing electricity to government offices and streetlights. It was dedicated to providing power to the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park, Ologbo, and Obayantor communities in the Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of the state. The new plant has raised the generation capacity of Ossiomo Power to 95MW, as a 55MW plant has been operational since 2020, Daily Trust reports.
