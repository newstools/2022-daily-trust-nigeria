Nigerian Singer, David Adeleke popularly known as Davido has fired back at his cousin, Dele Adeleke, for the second time. Taking to his Twitter page today, Davido accused his cousin of paying people to write negative things about him and his late mother. He tweeted, “Because of your ambition you have your people write about me (which I don’t care) but to include the death of my mother in an article… the same woman that raised you … @deleadeleke001 ok na .. 🙏🏾 Dele God will reward you.” Recall that the singer took to his Twitter page on Tuesday to call out his cousin over his interest in contesting in the Osun State governorship election against their uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke. In a recent interview, Dele Adeleke described himself as being more competent than his uncle to contest the election. The Aye crooner took to his Twitter page on Tuesday to share a photo of his cousin holding a clearance certificate from the Peoples Democratic Party. He wrote, “Wonderful! Me I finished uni with a 2:1. But it’s now cousin dele who struggled to even get a 2:2 that is now forming “intellectual”. Intellectual that has not succeeded in building one single thing in his life on his own. This life ehn! Osun beware of FAKES!”(sic)
