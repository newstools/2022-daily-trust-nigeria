Gunmen, on Wednesday, abducted the mother of Isyaku Ali-Danja, member representing Gezawa Constituency in the Kano House of Assembly. The gunmen were said to have stormed the residence of the lawmaker’s mother in Gezawa town around 1am on Wednesday, broke the door and abducted her. Ali Danja, who was once a speaker in the House, said the gunmen forcefully broke the door to her room and abducted her, after she refused to open for them. He added that immediately after the attackers left the house, one of the old woman’s caregivers raised the alarm, and police were immediately alerted. “Even before I went to Gezawa, the Divisional Police Officers had called me and told me that he deployed his officers to the scene. He said they have already launched investigation into the matter,” he said. “There is no contact from them so far. We are just praying to Almighty to save her life.” The Kano State Police Command is yet to comment on the matter.
