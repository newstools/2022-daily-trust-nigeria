Independent Power Plant (IPP), Ossiomo Power has commissioned a new 40MW in Benin City, the Edo State capital. The Managing Director, Ossiomo Power, Dr Uwa Igiehon, speaking with journalists, said in conjunction with the Edo State Government, the power plant is providing 24/7 power to the Ologbo and Obayantor communities in the area. He said the plant is an addition to the existing 55MW plant, which has been in operation in the state since 2020 and has been supplying power to government buildings, offices and streetlights among others. Dr Igiehon said the new plant is a testament to Governor Godwin Obaseki’s pledge to light up Edo State. He said the newly commissioned 40MW will provide power to the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park and local communities in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. According to Dr Igiehon, the 40MW plant was tested on the 29th of December and is fully operational, adding that the plant is providing electricity to Ologbo and Obayantor communities in the area. Dr Igiehon said the initiative has provided succour to members of the Ologbo community who now benefit from the power supply from the new power plant.
