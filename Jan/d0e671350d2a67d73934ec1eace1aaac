Eden Hazard scored his first Real Madrid goal in eight months on Thursday as LaLiga’s leaders staged a dramatic comeback with 10 men to scrape past Elche in the Copa del Rey. Madrid needed extra-time to win 2-1 at the Martinez Valero and were given a scare by Elche, whose Gonzalo Verdu gave them the lead in the 103rd minute, moments after Marcelo had been sent off. Yet Madrid came storming back, with Isco prodding in Dani Ceballos’ shot before Hazard rounded the goalkeeper and scored an 115th-minute winner. The victory sends Real Madrid into the quarterfinals, where they join Real Sociedad, Mallorca, Rayo Vallecano, Cadiz, Valencia and Real Betis.
