An Iyaganku magistrates’ court in Ibadan on Wednesday ordered that a 78-year-old woman, Oluyemi Ajani, and one Dasola Orolade (50), be remanded at the Abolongo correctional facility, Oyo, for attempting to kidnap. The police charged Ajani and Orolade with conspiracy, attempted kidnapping and threat. Chief Magistrate Emmanuel Idowu did not take the pleas of the suspects due to lack of jurisdiction and directed the police to return the case file to the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) and adjourned the case to February 15. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sgt Iyabo Oladoyin, told the court that the woman and others at large on November 3, 2021, at about 1pm in Alakia, Wema axis of Ibadan, attempted to kidnap some people using an ash-coloured Toyota Corolla with Reg No: APP 695 GK.
