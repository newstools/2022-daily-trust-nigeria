Speaking after a recovery session on Thursday, the Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper said he is happy seeing Maduka Okoye and Francis Uzoho getting the nods ahead of him. “I’m not under any pressure to start any game. If I’m called upon, I will be ready to man the sticks. I’m very happy for the two of them and I will wait for my turn. “In the last AFCON, I was the goalkeeper and this time, it’s someone else. Anything can happen anytime,” he said. He further said that the team wants to use football to bring peace to the nation. “We are taking the game one after the other. We hope the fans will still remain behind us. “We want to use football to bring peace to the nation.
