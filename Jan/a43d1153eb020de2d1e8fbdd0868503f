The Plateau State Government said on Wednesday that it has recorded one case of Lassa fever, which is the first, in Jos North LGA of the state. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Lar, confirmed the development to journalists in Jos, the state capital. While confirming the incident, the commissioner warned residents against the purchase of food items that are exposed to all forms of contamination. He advised them to be conscious of their environments and hygiene as part of efforts to curb the resurgence of Lassa fever in the state. “I want to challenge residents to take the hygiene of their environment seriously, to guard against infection from any form of disease. “We should learn to cover what we eat properly and avoid eating rats and bush meat. People should be mindful of the kinds of food they consume in view of the prevalent spread of the disease being recorded across the country,” he said. Mr Nimkong however said the state government was prepared through the Ministry of Health to tackle any unforeseen circumstances that might warrant an emergency and ensure that the recent development did not spread. He further called on citizens of the state to continue with the handwashing, social distancing and use of hand sanitisers in public places.
