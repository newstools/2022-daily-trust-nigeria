Aiwaju Bola Tinubu, Presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), travelled overseas to attend some meetings, according to Tunde Rahman, his media aide. There have been different reactions since the news of Tinubu’s recent trip abroad broke. The former Lagos governor returned to the country in October after undergoing knee surgery abroad. This had raised doubts on his fitness for the job he is aspiring to. In a statement, Rahman said Tinubu travelled to the UK for meetings and consultations, adding that the former governor will return to Nigeria next week. “Asiwaju Tinubu is in fine health and excellent spirits. The speculations in a national newspaper and on social media are just what they are: unfounded and untrue speculations.” “Asiwaju’s trip to the UK is not to rest or because of any illness. While abroad, Asiwaju is maintaining a vigorous schedule of meetings and consultations on a range of important matters. “Whether at home or abroad, the daily schedule of Asiwaju is vibrant and full. Most people couldn’t sustain his high level of activity. Asiwaju will return to Nigeria next week once this set of meetings and talks abroad are completed.”
