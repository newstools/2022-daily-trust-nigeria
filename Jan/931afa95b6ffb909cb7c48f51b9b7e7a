The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has described the six-year rule of the All Progressives Congress as evil, noting that only hope has kept Nigerians alive as their lives have been a living hell under the APC. Ayu, in his New Year message made available by his media office, urged Nigerians not to give up but to mobilise “and get this evil out of your lives”. “It is very important that you continue to live by hope. Honestly, only hope has kept us going for the last six years. Otherwise, our lives have been a living hell under the so-called regime of ‘CHANGE’. “Do not expect anything better from the APC in 2022. They will still make your life nasty, brutish and short. The good news is that all bad things come to an end. The hell that is APC will surely come to an end,” he said. Ayu noted that the year 2022 is an important year of hope for all Nigerians. “On behalf of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, I wish you a hopeful New Year; a year that we all begin the journey for the Liberation and Rebuilding of Nigeria.  So help us GOD,” he added. President Muhammadu Buhari, in his New Year message to Nigerians, had said his administration would remain resolute with its programmes and plans despite persistent insecurity in parts of the country threatening to undo the gains of the federal government. He said it was on record that his administration had invested heavily in re-equipping the military in a bid to upgrade the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country. He urged all citizens to hope for and envision a year of continued progress against “our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.”
