The suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, on Tuesday, said those spreading rumours of her purported sack from office are agents from the pit of hell. Usman in a statement issued on Tuesday also debunked media reports alleging that the Auditor-General of the Federation has issued some queries regarding monies being owed to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) by terminal operators. She said ordinarily, the NPA should clear the air about the allegations, and it is for this reason she refused to make any comments since the news broke. She, however, said it is becoming more apparent that tarnishing her image has now become the primary mission of promoters of the story. “On Tuesday morning, for instance, several people sent me a social media post with the title: “NPA audit indicts Hadiza Bala Usman for not remitting N40bn, $921.61m and £289.931.82 to federal government accounts. “I make bold to say that this report is untrue and a fallacy from the imagination of anyone spreading the falsehood. “I also challenge anyone with proofs of this allegation to present them in public. “The truth is that even if there are monies unremitted into the federal government’s accounts, these monies will remain in the Treasury Single Account (TSA) where all revenues generated by the authority domiciles. In addition, the authority will have explanations for any audit queries that may arise, whenever they do. “The report claimed that the imaginary allegations of abuse of office, corrupt enrichment and failure to account for billions of naira led to my purported sack. “I state without any equivocation that I have not received any information about my purported sack from any quarters until this moment. “I have also not been indicted for any offence as alleged in these increasing lies,” she said.
