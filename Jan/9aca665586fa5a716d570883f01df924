The interim Managing Director of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Engr. Akin Bada, said the company will collaborate with the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) to raise the competency of its workers to improve service delivery to customers. A statement by the spokesman of AEDC, Oyebode Fadipe, at the weekend, said Engr. Bada gave the assurance when he received the Director General of NAPTIN, Ahmed Nagode in his office in Abuja. He further said NAPTIN has transformed itself into an international brand such that it has become the first port of call for utilities seeking to train its personnel in the electricity industry in Africa. Bada said, “With your mandate and your pedigree as the foremost power training institute in Nigeria and the African continent therefore, AEDC will take good advantage of this opportunity to build the capacity of its workers.” Responding, Nagode congratulated Bada and the interim management team comprising Sani Usman, Donald Etim, Babajide Ibironke and Femi Zacchaeus on their appointment. The NAPTIN head also said the appointment of Engr. Bada who is a veteran in the power industry was indicative of the need to reposition AEDC for optimal service delivery to its customers. “In this regard, we are prepared to work with your management for the repositioning of AEDC as a critical asset in the country through training,” Nagode noted as he introduced the NAPTIN e-learning programme to the AEDC team. “Since this pandemic is not about to leave us anytime soon, as a training Institute, we adopted e-Learning in order to ensure that the capacity of the workers in the sector is continually enhanced,” said the NAPTIN head.
