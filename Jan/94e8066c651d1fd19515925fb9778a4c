 The National Association of University Students (NAUS) and the Students’ Union Government of the University of Ibadan on Saturday urged Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde to address the security challenges facing campuses in the state. While NAUS cited several robbery attacks on the students of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, the SUG also condemned incessant attacks on students staying off-campus of the institution. Both unions, in separate letters to the governor, raised concerns over security threats, citing areas where students were killed or injured during attacks within the institutions and off-campus, recently. Reacting to the letters, the state government through the Special Assistant to the Governor on Students Affairs, Victor Olojede, vowed to leave no stone unturned in putting an end to the insecurity in the institutions’ neighbourhoods. He said the government has already made some efforts towards finding a lasting solution to the security challenge.
