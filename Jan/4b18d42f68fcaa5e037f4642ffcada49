The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, says the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (NPTF) depends substantially on the revenue accruing from the Federation Account for the implementation of its programmes and activities. He, however, noted that with the dwindling state of national revenue, this source of revenue alone cannot sustain the Trust Fund in the attainment of its mandate of re-positioning the police to change the internal security narratives of the country. The IGP spoke at Force Headquarters in Abuja yesterday during the commissioning of N8.7bn operational vehicles and security equipment for the police. He called on all Nigerians, corporate bodies and multinationals to key into the goals of the Fund to enable it to accomplish its laudable objectives for the Nigeria Police Force and the nation at large. The Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, said the presentation of over 200 Buffalo branded operational vehicles and other security hardware, procured by the present administration through the NPTF as contained in its 2020 Budget, was part of the ongoing reformation of the Nigeria Police Force.
