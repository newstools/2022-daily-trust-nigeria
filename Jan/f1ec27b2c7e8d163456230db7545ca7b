Mohamed Salah, captain of Egypt national team, has explained how the loss to Nigeria helped his team put its house in order ahead of the clash with Guinea-Bissau. After a 1-0 loss against Nigeria in their AFCON opener, Salah kept the hope of Egypt alive in the encounter against Guniea-Bissau, on Saturday. He scored the lone goal in the encounter of the seven-time African champions with Guinea-Bissau. Speaking after being voted Man-of-the-match, Salah said, “We have a new coach and new generation. After the defeat against Nigeria we had to rearrange ourselves. We will fight in this tough competition and believe in our chances and where we can go. “We have to win our next game now to make sure we qualify and we will do our best to go as far as we can in the tournament.”
