The last may not have been heard about the stampede that claimed the lives of about 8 people as it has been gathered that the Confederation of African Football had earlier warned the Cameroon Football Federation over its lack of adequate security personnel to control the crowd. The warning came after about 40 fans invaded the pitch after the Cote d’Ivoire vs Algeria group game in the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Cameroon. The CAF Disciplinary Board had noted that the numbers of security stewards was insufficient to control the commotion triggered by an Algerian supporter who invaded the pitch. This incident caused CAF to impose a fine of $5,000 on the Algerian Football Federation for the invasion of the pitch triggered by their supporter. The Ivorian Football Federation was also slammed with a fine of $10,000 for the invasion of the field by their supporters, of which 5,000 are suspended provided that such an incident does not recur during the tournament. In the same vein, the Tunisian coach, Mondher Kbaier has been fined $5000 for entering the field without the referee permission during the group stage match with Gambia. He was not left alone as the goalkeeper, Farouk Ben Mustapha was also charged with misconduct and fined $5000 for using vulgar language towards the referee. The CAF Disciplinary Board also issued a call to order to Tunisian Football Federation regarding compliance with the principles of loyalty, integrity, sportsmanship and ethics.
