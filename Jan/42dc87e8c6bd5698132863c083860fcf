A former Minister of Works and National Chairman, South West Agenda for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (SWAGA), Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has joined the Ekiti State governorship race. He is urging the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee of the APC to adopt direct primary to elect the governorship candidate of the party. The former minister said it would be a fatal mistake for APC to allow an unpopular individual to be imposed on them during the January 27 primary meant to elect the candidate that would fly the party’s flag in Ekiti. “APC must win this election; they must pick someone that is popular. You can see for yourselves that people are with us. In 2018, we told some arrogant people that they won’t have their way through imposition and it happened. It is obvious that only a popular candidate can win for APC in this election. “The national leaders of our great party must return this party to the people. Let the national leaders adopt direct primary to elect the candidate for Ekiti poll,” he said.
