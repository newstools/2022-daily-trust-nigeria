The Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) is planning a rice festival in Abuja to support the federal government’s quest for food security in the country, Daily Trust has learnt. The festival is expected to be staged at the premises of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), and plans are already in top gear for the success of the exercise. When Daily Trust visited the proposed venue along the airport road, there was a beehive of activities as trailer loads of rice from different parts of the country were offloaded and arranged into rice pyramids.
