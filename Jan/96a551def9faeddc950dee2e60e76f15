President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness about the recent killings in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. Eighteen persons were reportedly killed in the incident. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the incident was not in keeping with the principles of the peace agreements reached between the Irigwe and the Fulani in the area. “My thoughts are with the families of the victims in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace,” the president said. He urged the various communities in the area, and particularly the Plateau State Interreligious Council, to do everything possible to commit to the peace agreement and prevent it from falling apart. “Every group taking the law into their hands claims to be retaliating. As a society, there is no place for this sort of violence. This is unacceptable,” Buhari warned. He commended Governor Simon Lalong for the state government’s handling of the incident so far.
