The Nigerian Naval Base, BEECROFT, has revealed how 20 foreign nationals attempted to ship in 168 bags of Indian hemp valued at N120 million. The suspects who are from one of the ECOWAS countries were arrested along the Lagos habour by naval officers on their NNS LANA ship. The latest arrest is coming barely three weeks after over N100m worth of Indian hemp was intercepted by naval officers of NNS BEECROFT. The Commander of NNS BEECROFT, Rear Admiral Bashir Mohammed, while parading the suspects yesterday at the NNS parade ground, Apapa, said the illicit substance was being ferried to the East on the waterway when it was intercepted in Lagos. The commander, who was represented by the Base Operations Officer (BOO), Lieutenant Commander Adetayo Yusuf Adesokan, said at about 6.40pm on Friday, January 14, 2022, Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) LANA, while on patrol, intercepted 20 foreigners and two wooden boats laden with 268 bags of Indian hemp. Commander Adesokan said, “Further search of the boat revealed that it was laden with 268 bags of Indian hemp worth over N120m, and three drums of AGO, each containing 200 litres, and 11 phones. “The arrest will send a strong message to criminals of the Nigerian Navy’s resolve of zero-tolerance to illegality. The trend of foreigners from neighbouring countries infiltrating our maritime space with contraband is worrisome. “In the last four months about 81 foreigners have been arrested for various crimes such as smuggling of cocaine, marijuana, rice and petroleum products.” He further said the suspects and the exhibits would be handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
