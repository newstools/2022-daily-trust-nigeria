The National Coordinator, Women in Nigeria for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (WIN 4 ABAT) and Secretary to the Southwest Agenda (SWAGA’23), Lagos State, Alhaja Kafilat Ogbara, has commended the former governor of Lagos State for yielding to the pressure mounted on him to contest the 2023 presidential election. Ogbara noted that the acceptance of the people’s call was a big victory for lovers of good governance across the country. “With his multitude of mentees doing well for humanity here in Nigeria and beyond, it is obvious that the pressure mounted on him by Nigerians is well-placed as the country will witness the arrival of a tested and trusted leader in building a formation of competent and world-tested hands in transforming the country; without prejudice to creed, calling or political affiliations,” she said. The Commissioner for Lagos State Audit Service Commission said Tinubu has all it takes to turn the fortunes of the country for good. “Asiwaju did it in Lagos State during his reign as governor, when his high level of strategic thinking in welcoming new innovations and allowing effective cross-cultural communication from competent hands snowballing the meagre Internally Generated Revenue of Lagos State from 300 million to 20 billion, making the state the fifth largest economy in Africa,” she said. Identifying the issue of political will as one of the major problems affecting the country, Ogbara explained that Tinubu possessed the wherewithal to break barriers in providing good governance for all and sundry. “It is common knowledge that the lack of political will is the major problem rocking leadership in our beloved country but with the coming of Asiwaju, his visionary steps will herald desired outcomes as he would work tirelessly to break barriers in giving hope to the common man. “Surmounting this biggest barrier in sticking to a bold course of action, Asiwaju will in no time become a symbol of hope for the masses, Women and Youths, hope for infrastructural development, hope for better healthcare, hope for quality education, hope for 21st century digital technology, hope for agricultural revolution, hope for good governance leading to hope for a better Nigeria,” she added.
