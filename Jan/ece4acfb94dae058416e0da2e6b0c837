The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested two men, Amos Dambaba Galadima (44) and Muhammed Jubril (35), over illegal gold mining in Osun State. The Commandant of NSCDC in the state, Mr Ocheja Emmanuel, said the two were arrested at a mining site located at Ita-Obi community in Ilesha. Ocheja, who disclosed that Galadima was from Niger State and Jubril from Gombe State, said they confessed to the crime of conspiracy and illegal mining. In a chat with our correspondent, Galadima said he knew that his action was illegal but that he was doing it to survive and cater for his children.
