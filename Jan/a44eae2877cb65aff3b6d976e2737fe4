The Managing Director of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG), Dr Philip Mshelbila, has sought partnership with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) to promote the realisation of the 100 per cent domestic gas supply announced by the company recently. Mshelbila, who stated this when he led his management team to the NMDPRA earlier this week, said the company would continue to prioritise the growing domestic Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) market and increase utilisation by supplying 100 per cent of its propane and butane production. He said NLNG would commence operations for the Nigerian domestic LNG market this year in line with the government’s plans to boost local consumption and grow industrialisation. On his part, the Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Engr Farouk Ahmed, said the authority was ready to partner with NLNG towards solving Nigeria’s energy challenges and increasing gas use in cooking, transportation and power generation. He commended the NLNG for its focus on domestic supply, which he noted had had a significant impact on deepening gas consumption in the country. The NMDPRA helmsman reiterated the federal government’s goal of deepening LPG and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), especially for autogas, as an alternative to petrol to cushion the effects of an upward spike in oil prices. Ahmed also said as the regulator of the midstream and downstream petroleum sector of Nigeria, NMDPRA would put in place policies that would not stifle businesses, but rather level the playing field and stimulate economic growth and job creation in the industry.
