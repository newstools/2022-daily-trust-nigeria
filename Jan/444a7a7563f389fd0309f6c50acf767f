Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, has revealed that Egyptian star player, Mohamed Salah was unable to hurt the team because the defenders didn’t let him out of their sight. It will be noted that Nigeria defeated Egypt by a lone goal on Tuesday in the Group D of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Speaking with journalists, Okoye who was still basking in the euphoria of the victory said the defenders kept the Liverpool man at bay and ensured he had only one chance at goal throughout the duration of the match. “Of course, he is one of the best players in the world but we also have fantastic defenders, fantastic midfielders so I think you could see that they were very sharp on him and he almost had no chance. “It was great. Omeruo did very, very well. He shone in this game and he was very important for us. “We have to continue to give our best for the country, for our families, and then we can go very, very far,” he said.
