A former Secretary to the Nasarawa State Government, Phillip Dada, has thrown his weight behind Malam Saliu Mustapha for the national chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the party’s national convention slated for February this year. He gave the endorsement during a courtesy call on Mustapha, a former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in Abuja. A statement signed by the Head of Saliu Mustapha Media Office, Dapo Okubanjo, said Dada promised to mobilise support among Nasarawa statutory delegates for Mustapha, the Turaki of Ilorin. Meanwhile, councillors from 99 wards in nine LGAs of Niger East Senatorial District have endorsed Senator Sani Musa for the national chairmanship position of APC. The councillors said Senator Musa has the tenacity to unite members of the party across board without regional and tribal discrimination. The Speaker, Chanchaga Local Government Legislative Council, Sani Imam, said Senator Musa stood for functional democracy hence the need to elect him to lead APC for the overall development of Nigerian democracy.
