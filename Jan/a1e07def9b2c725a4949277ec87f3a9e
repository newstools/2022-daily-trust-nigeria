Also, we keep having sensitisation programmes for people to know their rights, as justice delayed is not what we want in the State”, she said. She stated that the exercise was held at the State High Court, instead of the usual visitation across the correctional centres in the State due to the COVID-19 pandemic, promising that another phase of release would be done in the next four months. On his part, the State Controller of Correctional Centre, Mr Alimi Rasheed, said the Federal Government had intensified effort to upkeep and decongest the correctional centres in the State, appreciating the State government for its support in ensuring prompt justice dispensation.
