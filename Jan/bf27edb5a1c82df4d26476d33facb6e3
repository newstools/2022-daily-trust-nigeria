President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund (NDITF). NDITF is a private sector investment window with Nigerians in the Diaspora to support direct investments in the country. The president spoke yesterday at the presentation of a compendium entitled +600 Diaspora Icons @ 60, published by the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM). President Buhari said Nigeria remained open to welcoming the Diaspora Direct Investment by compatriots abroad. The president, who also pledged support for the establishment of the Diaspora Intervention Fund to support the Commission to fulfil its mandate, said the foreign exchange remittances by Nigerians in the Diaspora had not only helped families but enhanced the development index of Nigeria. In her remarks, the Chairman/CEO of NiDCOM, Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa explained that the Commission plans to publish the compendium at regular intervals, towards changing the negative stereotypes typified by the activities of a few Nigerians who do not represent the country well.
