Morocco defeated AFCON debutants Comoros 2-0 to maintain the winning start in the ongoing AFCON tournament in Cameroon. The Atlas Lions scored once in each half to claim the win that qualifies the North Africans into the Round of 16 stages of the tournament. Selim Amallah scored the opener on 16 minutes before Zakaria Aboukhla added the clincher a minute to the end. Star striker Youssef En-Nesyri missed a penalty kick minutes before Aboukhla won it for Morocco, taking his country to six points from two AFCON matches, three ahead of Ghana whom they defeated in their first game. Ghana. however, continued to remain winless in Cameroon, conceding an 88th-minute goal to settle for a 1-1 draw with Gabon. In the final game of the day, Andre Ayew hit an unstoppable low drive on 18 minutes to put Ghana ahead with his 10th goal ever in AFCON. Gabon, however, never gave up and was rewarded for their effort through Jim Allevinah who found the bottom corner with a well-placed shot. The Brazilians of Gabon stay second in Group C with four points from two matches while Ghana stays third with just a point and makes their chance of qualifying for the latter stages slim. The first match of the day failed to inspire as Senegal and Guinea settled for a goalless draw in their Group B encounter. Both sides are on four points apiece and the group winner is to be decided in the final group matches. Results
