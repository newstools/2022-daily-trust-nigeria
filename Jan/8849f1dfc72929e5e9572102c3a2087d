The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, has vowed that Nigeria will not experience coup again because the Armed Forces of Nigeria have pledged its total loyalty to democratic rule in the country. Irabor, who stated this on Friday when he appeared on Channels Television’s morning show: Sunrise Daily, ahead of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, reiterated that the military will not relent in discharging its constitutional duties. The Defence Chief’s declaration comes amid rising cases of coups in many African countries. Mali, Guinea, and Sudan, are among countries where there have been forceful takeover of power by the military. Speaking on the development, Irabor said, “Today, I believe that Nigerians are no longer in doubt as to the subordination of the military to civil rule; I believe that no one is in doubt that democracy has come to stay. “I believe that no one is in doubt any longer that the current military leadership, and of course, since the democratisation in 1999, that the military is well focused to perform its constitutional roles.” According to him, some Nigerians might still be struggling with the experience of military involvement in politics in the past, stressing that there is a need to educate the coming generation about the nation’s history. He added, “I am sure you also know that issues that have to do with civic responsibilities still require a little push; I am sure you know that literacy level in the nation still requires a little push; and so when you bring these factors among several other things, you know that quite a lot of work needs to be done. “Going forward, I believe that some of these misperceptions that some Nigerians have had with respect to military engagement will begin to change.”
