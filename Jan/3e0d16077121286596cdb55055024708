 The Managing Director of Coleman Wires and Cables, George Onafowokan has said that the manufacturing of fibre optic cables by the company would place Nigeria in the 5th position in Africa. Speaking on the production of the cables that will begin in January 2022, he said that this would serve telecommunication, oil and gas, and some other sectors. When asked about the economic value of this to the country, Onafowokan said, “It will make Nigeria be the 5th in the production of cables in Africa. “The key impact of this is that we will meet up with the local supply and demand of fibre optic cables and the large capacity that we are putting in place on phase one will help us to produce up to 150 to 200,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables of different sizes and that to us is a game-changer for the country. “The drive for data communication in the country would improve greatly because until now, we were importing the cables. “This is what Coleman is known for, making it possible to have expertise in the country and we have been able to show that we are capable and irrespective of the problems in the country, a lot of things can still be done. “That has been our drive and it is a blessing in disguise for Nigeria and we can look for a way to solve the problem of data expansion with the introduction of 5G,” Onafowokan added. The Coleman Wires and Cables MD stressed that the move is in line with the federal government and NCC’s drive to have a fibre optic cables manufacturer in the country, adding that this was why the company embarked on the laudable project. Onafowokan revealed that the commercial production of fibre optic cables will start from January 2022 and that this will provide fibre optic cables in 48, 96,144 and up to 288 fibres in the country. He said that the production of fibre optic cables would help Nigeria knowing fully well that the country has a big deficiency in transmission.
