The Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major General Shu’aibu Ibrahim, has unveiled an ultra-modern printing press in Kaduna. Speaking while commissioning the project, Gen Shu’aibu described the printing press as another milestone in the corps’ effort to re-invigorate its ventures. He said, the project, conceived almost a decade ago, was one of the cardinal points of his administration’s policy thrust, noting that, “The printing press would be a veritable source of revenue with attendant increase in remittances to federal government coffers. “Funds that would be realised from the printing press would address infrastructure deficit in the scheme, as well as enhance training and provision of start-up capital for youth corps members under the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development Programme of the scheme.” He added that the printing press and similar ones that would be sited in other geo-political zones would be open to the public, and charged the managers to handle the facility well so as to meet the printing and publication needs of NYSC formations and the public in the North West.
