Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has said he is not aspiring for any higher political position in 2023. There have been rumours that the governor is eyeing the number two position in the country. But speaking at the 19th Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja on Thursday, Zulum said becoming the governor of Borno was not something he planned. “We are now coming closer to the 2023 general elections but for me, it’s not important, I’m not interested in any position. I never planned to be the governor of Borno State and I’m not willing to aspire for any higher position but as a Muslim, you should always pray for the best,” he said. He advised people to look into the possibility of selecting good leaders rather than the elections itself. “We have to look into the possibility of selecting good leaders, whether we like it or not. How? that remains the very big question; whether in PDP, whether in APC, I think we need to see how we can get good leaders.”
