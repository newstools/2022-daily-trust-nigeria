However, a media aide to the FCT Minister of state, Aderonke Bello, said that such moves had been averted. She said, “The Minister was very furious when she heard about such plans to disrupt activities on the football pitch, and she has immediately stopped it.” The pitch had been mostly abandoned until October 2021 when private sector-driven initiative anchored by Ratels Sports Development Foundation (RSDF) regrassed the pitch and renovated the dressing rooms. Since then, most football clubs have been using the grass turf as their training and playing ground for top class League matches. Aside football activities, the side part of the pitch has laid tracks where athletes and other individuals use for fitness purposes.
