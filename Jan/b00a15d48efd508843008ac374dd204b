The Nigeria Customs Service, Seme Command, has recovered 84,250 litres of petrol from different criminal gangs operating in the Badagry creeks. The seizure was made in covert operations embarked upon by the service in the last two months. Customs Area Controller, Seme Area Command, Bello Mohammed Jibo, made this disclosure at the weekend while showcasing another batch of 30,150 litres of petrol that was seized from suspected smugglers. He said the suspects attempted to ferry the petrol through the waterways into Benin Republic, where they intend to sell it at a very high price. Daily Trust had reported in December that the command intercepted about 22,500 litres of petrol from suspected smugglers. Jibo further revealed that the commutative value of all the seizures made in the three operations, which were conducted between November 2021 and January 2022 is about N15.688 million and that the volume is about three truck loads. “Smuggling of petroleum also possess threats to their own lives and most times vehicles get burnt when accidents occur,” he said.
