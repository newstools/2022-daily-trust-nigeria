Super Eagles assistant captain, William Troost-Ekong, has said despite back to back victories at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, the players are still hungry for victory in their last group match. After recording a slim 1-0 victory over the Pharaohs of Egypt in the Group D opener last Tuesday, the Super Eagles followed up with a commanding performance against Sudan as they spanked their opponents 3-1 to reach the Round of 16. The three-time African champions will round up the group phase with a third and final group match against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday in Garoua where they are topping the group with six points. Speaking after yesterday’s training, the Watford hard as nail defender said he still believes his team mates are hungry for success and will not put the foot off the pedal against Guinea-Bissau even as the team has qualified for the Round of 16. “We still have a long way to go. In the game against Sudan, there were some things we saw and we didn’t know but the most important thing is to keep our feet on the ground. “We want to keep winning. There will be no complacency as we face our last group opponents on Wednesday,” he assured.
