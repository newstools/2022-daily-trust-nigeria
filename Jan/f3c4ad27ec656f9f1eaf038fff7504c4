The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Benue State on Tuesday paraded a suspected human trafficker nabbed with six young female victims as they prepared for a trip outside the country. This is barely three days after the police and National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in Benue foiled two separate attempts to traffic 32 children to Ogun State and six women abroad. The State Commandant of NSCDC, Dr. Philip Okoh, while parading the suspect, Mnena Kwaghmande, who was said to have been intercepted opposite Amaco Hotel in Gboko, Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State on January 5, with the victims all ready to travel to Burkina Faso, cautioned parents against giving out their children based on promises of greener pastures. He told newsmen that on interrogation, it was discovered that the suspect had told parents of the young girls whom she picked from Vandeikya Local Government Area of the state that she was taking them to go and sell food in her restaurant in Burkina Faso. “Behind me, we have a seasoned trafficker who goes about luring unsuspecting parents through convincing them that they are going abroad for greener pastures. “Investigation, however, revealed that they (victims) were been taken to Burkina Faso. We did this operation in conjunction with NAPTIP,” he said, stressing that such journeys had and are still landing many in unimaginable trouble. The victims who were aged between 16 and 20, in a chat with journalists, disclosed that the suspect, whom they identified as their relative, had told their parents that she was sick and therefore needed them to go with her to Burkina Faso so that they could help sell food at her restaurant.
