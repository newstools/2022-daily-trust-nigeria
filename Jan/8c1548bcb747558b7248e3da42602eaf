The recent shortage of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) has eased in and around the FCT, a Daily Trust survey has revealed. Our correspondent who went round parts of the capital city reports an improved situation, as many filling stations are dispensing devoid of long queues. Last week was not the best of time for car owners in the FCT as many filling stations were shut, which caused artificial scarcity and long queues of vehicles at the stations. On a Sunday tour, our correspondent observed that most filling stations along Kubwa-Gwarimpa-Maitama Expressway were selling at the official rate. Also, many filling stations at Utako, Jabi, Wuse II, Zones 6 and 4 and other places visited were selling without queues. Last week, only few filling stations in and around the FCT were seen dispensing the product, with one or two pumping machines each amid long queues. Experts attributed the fuel scarcity to hoarding and panic buying in anticipation of subsidy removal that was later suspended by the federal government. Commenting on the development in a statement on Wednesday, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Garba-Deen Muhammad, advised buyers not engage in panic buying as the corporation had sufficient petrol to meet the needs of Nigerians.
