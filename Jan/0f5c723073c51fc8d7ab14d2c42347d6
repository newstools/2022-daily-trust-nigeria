Bandits have killed one person and abducted 15 others in Batagari Village, Maikujeri District of Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. Daily Trust gathered that the bandits invaded the village in the evening on Sunday, abducting fifteen villagers, mostly women. A source who spoke in confidence told our correspondent that “The attackers came on motorcycles and shot into the air to scare the villagers”. He said, “After causing panic, they started moving from house to house, ransacking buildings and taking away their valuable properties, especially food items”. Another source said the kidnappers were yet to establish communication with the relations of the abductees as at the time of filing this report on the incident. Efforts to get police confirmation proved abortive as the Niger State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached.
