Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has installed the first monarch in Moriwi kingdom in Imeko-Afon LGA of the state, coming more than a century after the community was founded. The sleepy community is said to have been founded by Baale Salako during the First World War in 1914. Abiodun on Wednesday installed Oba James Taiwo as the first Alale of Moriwi kingdom amid pomp and pageantry. The governor presented the letter of appointment to the monarch, while the staff of office was handed over to him by the Olu of Ilaro and Paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, who was represented by Olu of Imeko, Oba Benjamin Olanite. In his remarks, Abiodun who was represented by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afuape, said the monarch’s appointment is a call to serve, as well as an opportunity to create a sustainable, conducive environment for credible investors. The governor enjoined the people of Moriwi and its environs to cooperate with the new king to bring the development they have been yearning for in the community. The governor, however, cautioned the monarch against going beyond Moriwi to install baales or chiefs. In his acceptance speech, Oba Taiwo appreciated the governor for the trust reposed in him promising to discharge his responsibilities with the fear of God, equity, fairness and justice.
