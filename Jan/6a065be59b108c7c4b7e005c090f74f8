Yahaya Muhammed Galadima (25), a mechanic who had his two hands cut off by gunmen has recounted his travails to Daily Trust. Galadima, who specialises in repairing J5 vehicles, was ambushed while returning from Rukubi after fixing a vehicle in Doma Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. Galadima is currently receiving treatment at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital in Lafia. Recounting the experience, Galadima said, “It happened around 8pm on Tuesday night. I was with one of my boys, Salisu Haruna, who followed me to Rukubi. We went there on my motorcycle to work in one of my customers’ houses as his J5 had developed some mechanical fault. “While on our way back, before Yelwa, we were ambushed. Before we knew what was happening both of us fell off my motorcycle and my boy sustained injuries on his left leg. They didn’t hurt my boy.” He said the gunmen shot sporadically, asking that he should give them money, and that they also collected his phone and motorcycle. He further said, “Before asking them what was wrong, they cut off my hands.” When contacted, the Nasarawa State police spokesman, ASP Nansel Ramhan, said the command was yet to be informed about the incident.
