Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has acquired two sets of 10 cars Talgo 330kmph speed trains from a Spanish train manufacturer, Talgo in the United States for the red line rail project. At the event inside the Milwaukee Facility of Talgo in the US, Governor Sanwo-Olu said the State Government was excited to complete the purchase of the two brand new trains. “We hope that the purchase of the trains will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial business relationship. Providing a source of livelihood for our citizens is all about providing jobs for our people and that is what we are doing. It is about ensuring that we can build our economy; people can move from one location to another and businesses can grow,” said Sanwo-Olu. The trains will be heading to Lagos, for the ongoing Red Line, a 37km track rail project with its first phase launching by end of this or early 2023 and can ferry 500,000 passengers daily. It will have 11 stations and will be the first operational metro system in West Africa. Acting Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said: “I am sending my congratulations to the Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria, but also a little disappointed that we missed out on the opportunity to have those train sets operating here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin.” CEO and President, Talgo USA, Antonio Perez, said, “For us, it is important that our trains are utilised. It doesn’t do any good for the trains that we built to be stored and kept without passengers riding them.”
