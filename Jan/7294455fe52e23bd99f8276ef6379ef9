The President of Confederation of African Football (CAF), Patrice Motsepe has said the football body should not be blamed for the stampede that killed about eight fans on Monday. Motsepe also confirmed that Sunday’s fixture which was scheduled for Olembe — between the winners of Egypt-Ivory Coast and the winners of Morocco-Malawi — would now be moved to Olembe. CAF also revealed that the 30 January meeting between the winners of Senegal-Cape Verde and the winners of Mali-Equatorial Guinea would be moved to Limbe from Douala. “The security is the responsibility of the Local Organising Committee and it is not CAF’s responsibility. CAF responsibility is to advise. CAF has no legal obligation and has no responsibility and should not be blamed. But we are partners and it’s not time to point fingers. “The next games scheduled in Olembé should no longer take place.  The match which is scheduled in Olembé on Sunday will not take place in this stadium. “I have already told the Cameroonian government.  This match will be played at the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium,” Motsepe announced at a press conference. While Motsepe revealed that CAF would hold a meeting with the Cameroonian Organising Committee to get more clarity on the circumstances surrounding the stadium disaster, he believed that a closed gate—reported as being the East Entrance of the arena—led to the loss of life. “There was a gate that was closed that was meant to be open, and if it had been open, people would have walked through. For inexplicable reasons, it was closed,” he said.
