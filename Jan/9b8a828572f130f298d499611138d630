 The First City Monument Bank (FCMB) says it has finalised a partnership with the Ogun State Government to provide loans for interested subscribers of government housing schemes. The Group Chief Executive of the FCMB, Ladi Balogun, said this while speaking when he led the management staff of the bank on a courtesy visit to Governor Dapo Abiodun in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He noted that the bank gesture was to enable residents of the state own houses they could call their own. He stressed that the financial institution was ready to give Governor Abiodun-led administration support through its Corporate Social Responsibility platform, saying the government alone can not carry the burden of meeting the needs of the people. Balogun, who described 2021 as a difficult year for everyone, explained that the meeting with the governor was to open a channel of engagement that would promote the quality of life of the people, adding that the bank would work with the state government in any area it chooses for collaboration. While appreciating the state government for its developmental strides, especially in the area infrastructure, Balogun said that the desire of the bank was to help the present administration finish its tenure well and as well as lay a solid foundation for the future”. “We are willing to do more with the present administration in the state in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility. The bank is focused on how it can elevate the quality of lives of the people they serve and work with”, the FCMB CEO stated. Responding, Abiodun called for a more robust relationship between his administration and the management of the bank in its quest to make more people become landlords. Abiodun noted that despite his administration’s efforts at providing over 1,000 homes in the last 30 months, the effort seemed not enough as people have continued buying faster than what is currently on the ground.
