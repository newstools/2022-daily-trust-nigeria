A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has said he is yet to make a decision to contest the presidential election in 2023. Kwankwaso, in an interview yesterday with DW Hausa, said consultations were in progress with critical stakeholders. The Kano former governor contested the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) prior to the 2019 general elections but didn’t make it. He said: “In this kind of situation we are not rushing to make decisions. So, we are critically watching and consulting the right people to advise us and whatever I decide will be communicated to our people. “We have huge support that is enough to contest for anything. We have people everywhere not only in Nigeria. Some people think that we only have people in Kano or in the North, but the truth is we have people in Asia, America and Europe,” Kwankwaso said. Kwankwaso also denied defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as reported on social media, saying, “For now, I’m not aware of this and I’m not in any discussion with anybody about decamping to APC. So, that is it for now.”
