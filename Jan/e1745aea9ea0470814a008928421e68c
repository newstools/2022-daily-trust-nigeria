 Several angry passengers of Azman Air stormed the office of the airline in Kano after the cancellation of the 7 am flight to Lagos on Monday. It was gathered that the airline only informed the passengers of the cancellation of the flight via an e-mail a few minutes before the scheduled departure. Some of the passengers said they had international flights to board in Lagos and were furious as to why Azman sent them a cancellation message just a few minutes to schedule departure. Most of them said they were travelling to Lagos for a connecting flight to London, Egypt, Dubai, Ghana, and other destinations for medical reasons. The passengers later mobilised themselves from the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) and stormed the airline’s office at Zaria Road in protest of the unsavoury development. Reacting to the development, the General Manager, AZMAN Air services Suleiman Lawan said: “Actually, what happened with the flight of today is as a result of a technical snap on the flight. We believe in safety so we have to rectify the problem. “We slept at the airport yesterday hoping to get it fixed before morning and it was a little late for the passengers to have the information which some got, some did not.” He added that those who asked for a refund have been given back their money with an apology while others were rescheduled for another flight.
