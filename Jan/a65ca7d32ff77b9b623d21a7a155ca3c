The Federal Ministry of Power said the intervention of the federal government led to the payment of all salaries and 20 months pension contribution backlogs of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) employees. In a statement, the ministry said the delay in clearing the backlogs recently caused industrial action that shutdown the company’s facilities and disrupted power across FCT, Kogi, Nasarawa and Niger state. The intervention of the ministry facilitated the payment of the entitlements of AEDC staff, as agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) and other stakeholders in December last year. The entitlements settled include; unpaid allowances, salaries, union deductions and unremitted 20 months pension contributions deducted from workers’ salaries. The Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu, reaffirmed the commitment of the Federal Ministry of Power to working with all stakeholders to ensure steady electricity supply and stability in the electricity industry. Engr. Aliyu added that the federal government will continue to ensure that all the electricity sector players and stakeholders work according to the rules and guidelines. In December 2021, the ministry took the initiative that ended the AEDC workers strike by engaging the organised labour. The strike action last year came at the same time as changes in shareholding in AEDC and the appointment of an interim management for AEDC by the shareholders and endorsed by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the statement noted.
