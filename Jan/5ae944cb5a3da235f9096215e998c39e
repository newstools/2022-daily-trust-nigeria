A Benin Chief Magistrate’s Court has adjourned the case between Ikpoba Slope community and Abattoir owner in the community, Mrs Sarah Uwaifor, over alleged environmental pollution to February 16, for continuation of hearing following absence of defendant principal lawyer. The community had on November 24, 2021 dragged the abattoir owner in the area, Mrs Sarah Uwaifor, to court over alleged environmental pollution in the community, alleging that the cow dungs and waste excreta from her abattoir dumped in the community as well as burning of cow hair and skin constitute nuisance in the area. They also prayed for perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, her servants, agents, or workers at the abattoir from dumping cow remains, roasting of cow head and dumping of cow dungs along the streets. The community also asked for N5 million damages from the defendant for the “nuisance” she has been and still constituting in the area.

Abayomi Thomas, argued that the counsel who asked for adjournment has not been able to file a defense on the case before the time elapse.
