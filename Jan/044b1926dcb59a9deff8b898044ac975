The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) will today (Thursday) arraign a skit maker, Sunday Joshua, popularly known as De-General, alongside three other suspects, who were arrested with illicit drugs when operatives of the agency raided a drug joint at Orchid Estate, Lekki, Lagos State on Wednesday. A spokesman for the agency, Femi Babafemi told Daily Trust that the suspects, including Joshua, would be arraigned in court. “The charge file has been prepared and any moment from tomorrow, they would have their days in court,” he said. He also said that the agency does not delay prosecution of suspects and that others have followed similar patterns. Babafemi said on Wednesday in Abuja that the narcotic officers swooped on the drug joint in the estate and arrested three suspects with 200 sachets of 225mg Tramadol and 1.5kgs of Indian hemp. He said some persons including the suspected dealer ran away with bags suspected to contain exhibits. “A trail showed they ran into a house located at 2B Saula Akinlolu way, Orchid Estate, which is the residence of 22-year-old Sunday Joshua (aka De-General). The young men started to make noise to prevent a search. “The operatives introduced themselves as officers of NDLEA and submitted themselves for search before entry. This was done and a search was conducted. “The search led to the recovery of drug exhibits including Indian hemp; Tramadol 225mg, and some paraphernalia for drug use. This was after the suspect had requested to record on video the search, which the officers out of a sense of civility allowed. “The video trending on social media was the moment the suspect and his friends decided to disrupt the bid to conduct a search of the house,” Babafemi said.
