A former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, will today in Enugu host South East leaders and PDP officials to perfect ways of ensuring his emergence as a sole presidential candidate from the zone. Anyim, who served as Secretary to Federal Government (SGF) during the era of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, had in October last year declared his intention to contest for the presidency. Daily Trust gathered from credible sources that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State was strongly pushing for Anyim candidature from the South East; Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal from the North West or Bauchi State Governor from the North East. “Wike is already talking to stakeholders in the South East to support Anyim and Thursday’s meeting in Enugu will basically dwell on this,” one of our sources said. He said even though Wike is also interested in the presidency, “he is not putting his eggs in one basket; he wants to be reckoned with whichever way it goes,” he said. PDP chairman in Enugu State, Chief Augustine Nnamani could not be reached and he did not respond a text message seeking to know their position on today’s meeting with Anyim.
