The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development yesterday began training staff of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) across the country on result-based monitoring and evaluation. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, while speaking at the training organised for staff of NSIP and selected departments of the ministry in Abuja, said it would empower monitoring and evaluation practitioners and managers in the ministry with the skills needed to deliver effectively on their tasks. Represented by the National Coordinator of NSIP, Dr Umar Bindir, Farouq declared that NSIP “Was created by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 with the mandate of lifting citizens out of poverty through a number of social interventions, which include the job creation programme, NPOWER; National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP); Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP). “The importance of Monitoring & Evaluation in current development & humanitarian programs cannot be overemphasised. M&E implementation in programs/policies helps in improving performance and achieving results.” The minister charged participants to use the acquired knowledge to variously facilitate and achieve improved service delivery to Nigerians. She said: “I hope that resulting from this training, we will find a number of areas in our various offices where we can apply what we have learnt here during the week-long training. I am hopeful that you will all use this newly acquired knowledge to variously facilitate and achieve improved service delivery to our yearning citizens. “I also want to inform participants that reports emanating from a very good Result-Based Monitoring and Evaluation System attract especially international donors’ funding and support to our policies and Programmes.”
