Ahead of Wednesday’s Group D clash with the Wild Dogs of Guinea Bissau at the Stade Roumdé Adjia in Garoua, Super Eagles coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has said his side will retain its winning mentality. He said “It is important for us to sustain the winning mentality while we keep our heads on our shoulders. Just as I told the boys after the match against Egypt, we are yet to win anything here except points. Guinea Bissau need the three points because they have only one so far and we must be prepared for a massive fight. “If we let down our guard, we could be punished, and that would not be good for the team’s psychology. We will go for the three points.” Guinea Bissau drew 0-0 with Sudan in their first match, losing a penalty awarded to them late in the game, and then fell to a Mohamed Salah goal in a match they gave their all and even felt they should have been awarded an equaliser that was cancelled late in the encounter. “With a little more luck, they could have beaten Sudan and could have drawn with Egypt. That is the kind of opposition we face on Wednesday. Nobody will tell me they’re pushovers,” added Eguavoen. Meanwhile, Nigeria may likely face Malawi, Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Tunisia, Mali or Gambia in the second round, but Eguavoen is confident of victory over any of the teams.
