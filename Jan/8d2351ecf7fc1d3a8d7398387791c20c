The mood in Garoua still remains solemn hours after the Super Eagles were dumped out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The bubbly city has become a ghost town with visitors, fans and even the players trooping out in droves. Most residents of Garoua who spoke to our reporter said they expected the Super Eagles to advance beyond the Round of 16. According to them, they had envisaged the finals of the tournament to be between Cameroon and Nigeria. “I wept when Nigeria was sent parking. I was looking forward to a final between our countries in Yaoundé but sadly that will not happen. We have been supporting Nigeria as they are like our second country. I have lots of good Nigerian friends and they are many of them here,” Adamo Hamadou said. Moussa Bouba, whose relaxation shop is close to the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua said he made good money over the recent weeks as fans who couldn’t afford the ticket came to him to watch football. He said he had the highest turnover whenever the Super Eagles were playing. “It’s so sad that the Super Eagles are longer in the competition. I had estimated how much I was going to earn till quarter-finals if they had defeated Tunisia but that will not be again. I made more money during Nigeria’s matches,” he said. Meanwhile, the Super Eagles have departed Cameroon aboard Air Peace to Abuja and from there the players are expected to take individual flights to their various clubs.
