Fourteen inmates of the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Afara, Umuahia, have regained their freedom during a jail delivery conducted by the Abia State Chief Judge, Justice Onuoha Ogwe, today. Speaking while conducting the jail delivery, the State Chief Judge said the exercise was pursuant to his schedule of duties bestowed on his office. Justice Ogwe noted that most of those released have nothing to show for their continued stay at the prison yard and advised them to turn a new leaf and contribute positively to society instead of constituting a nuisance.
