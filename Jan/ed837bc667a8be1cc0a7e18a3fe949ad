The member representing Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency of Osun State in the House of Representatives, Oluwole Oke, has advised the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to retain Senator Ademola Adeleke as its gubernatorial candidate in the governorship election in 2022. He made the call in a statement titled ‘Allow Peace, Unity in Osun PDP’ in which he appealed to all the aggrieved members of the party in the state to sheathe their swords, work as a strong force to ensure victory in the governorship and other future elections in the state. Oke said, Senator Adeleke being the erstwhile gubernatorial candidate of the party in the 2018 election, ought to have been adopted for the coming election, unless if he declined. He also called on Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, who is the only PDP senator from Osun State to rise to the challenge and unite all the aggrieved factions in the interest of all stakeholders.
