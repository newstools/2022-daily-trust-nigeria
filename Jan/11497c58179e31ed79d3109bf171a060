A participant, Maryam Umar who owns a catering business explained how the conference inspired and helped her to network with other women in business. “I am excited to have met and discussed with great minds and strong women in businesses and I have also learned from their stories in order to surmount the challenges in my business”. Amira Yusif, another Kano-based entrepreneur in make-up business, said having attended the women conference, she can now leverage on the technological innovation ideas discussed at the gathering to promote her business and increase her customers. The co-founder of StartupKano, Aisha Tofa, said having realized the unavailability of job opportunities for the youths, StartupKano was established in order to create a platform for young people to interact, network and provide solutions and opportunities amongst themselves.
