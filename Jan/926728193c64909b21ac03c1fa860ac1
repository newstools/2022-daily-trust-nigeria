 The police in Ogun State have arrested three men for vandalising and stealing from the mast of a telecommunications company, MTN. The suspects, Kabiru Olusola (27), Taye Daniel (43) and Afeez Balogun (47), were arrested following a distress call to Atan Ota Division. One Shuaib Muhammed, identified as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of the company in charge of the mast, alerted the police that six hoodlums invaded the premises of mast at Ketu. The police spokesman in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Sunday, told newsmen that a patrol team from the division went to the scene where the three suspects were arrested while others escaped. He said seven backup batteries valued at N3m, a rectifier module, as well as a vehicle with registration number AAA 779 XL, were recovered from the suspects. Oyeyemi said the suspects would be charged to court as soon as possible while the escaped members of the gang would be tracked down and brought to justice.
