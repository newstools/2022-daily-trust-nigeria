Chief Ernest Shonekan, leader of the Interim National Government that was set up after the annulment of the June 12, 1993, election, is dead. Shonekan had taken over after General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd) on August 26, 1993, but his government was toppled by the late General Sani Abacha on November 17, 1993. Abacha, who was then Secretary Of Defence of the Interim National Government led by Shonekan, reportedly briefed the Head of the ING about the ongoing turmoil across the country with regards to the annulment of June 12 elections. He was said to have willingly resigned and handed over to Abacha, who ruled until his death in 1998. Shonekan, who hailed from Abeokuta in Ogun State, was born and raised in Lagos. He attended C.M.S Grammar School and Igbobi College, Lagos, before obtaining a law degree from the University of London, and was later called to the bar.
