 Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong has assured opposition political parties of his administration’s continued support to strengthen growth and progress of democracy. Lalong, who gave the assurance while responding to the electoral committee of the Inter Party Advisory Council of Nigeria (IPAC), on a courtesy call, said the council was critical to the progress of democracy and Plateau State. Represented by his Special Adviser on Inter Party Affairs, Bashir Musa Sati, Lalong described IPAC as the nerve centre of political parties’ connectivity and activities. “For his Excellency as a leader in the state, he is not only concerned about the APC, but all other political parties, on how they are faring and where is it that they are not getting it right so that we can collectively give the state a political direction,” he said. The chairman of IPAC national electoral committee, El-Mansur Isa Maidawa, who is also the National Auditor of National Rescue Movement (NRM), said they were in Jos to conduct elections into offices of the state chapter.
