 The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Osun State has arrested a woman, Zainab Afeez, for pouring hot water on her 11-year-old daughter, Balikis Afeez. The Commandant of NSCDC in the state, Mr Ocheja Emmanuel, said, before the hot water incident, the woman was engaging her daughter in child labour and always beating and inflict injuries on her. The woman, who confessed that she abused her daughter and poured hot water on her, said the devil pushed her to do so. The NSCDC boss also paraded two suspected fraudsters, Hezekiah Oladehi and Muftau Adeyemo, for duping people.
