President Muhammadu Buhari has described the drone strikes in the United Arab Emirates that caused explosions and a deadly fire outside the capital, Abu Dhabi, as a “worrisome escalation”. The President, in a statement issued Tuesday by his media aide, Garba Shehu, said such attacks targeting innocent people and civilian infrastructure, leading to the loss of lives were condemnable by all reasonable opinions around the globe and should be stopped. “On behalf of the government and the people of Nigeria, we express our deepest sympathies and condolences to the people and the friendly state of the UAE,” said President Buhari. He urged restraint to give dialogue and engagement a chance.
