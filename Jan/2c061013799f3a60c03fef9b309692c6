The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Gombe State Command, has said it recorded no fewer than 14 deaths in 46 crashes during its Operation Zero Crash campaign. The 2021 Operation Zero Crash lasted from December 14, 2021, to January 15, 2022. The FRSC Sector Commander, Mr Ishaku Ibrahim, who disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said within the period under review, 294 people were involved in the crashes while 136 sustained injuries. He said though the number of crashes reduced in 2021 when compared to that of 2020, the number of deaths remained a source of concern to the corps, explaining that the disturbing issue with the 2021 operation was the increase in the number of motorcycles involved in the crashes. Mr Ibrahim said, “From the analysis of vehicles involved in the crashes in 2020 and 2021, we discovered that in 2020 motorcycles involved in the crashes were 17, but in 2021, 42 motorcycles were involved. “Generally, in the number of vehicles involved, there has been an increase. However, motorcycles were involved in more serious accidents.” He further said the major causes of crashes recorded included speeding, one-way driving, dangerous overtaking and mechanically deficient vehicles, especially break failure. He, therefore, urged motorists to minimise night journey, saying that most crashes that resulted to death occurred at night.
