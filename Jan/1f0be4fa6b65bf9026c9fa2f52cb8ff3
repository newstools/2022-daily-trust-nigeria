Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the member representing Tarauni federal constituency in Kano, Hafizu Kawu, has described Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as the right candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Kawu’s stance is coming as a surprise to observers of Kano politics since he is seen as one of the loyalists of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje who has not hidden his support for the candidature of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Daily Trust reports that both Osinbajo and Tinubu have not officially declared their intention to run for the highest political office in the land come 2023. Kawu, who is also a former aide to Osinbajo, told journalists in Kano that his former boss has demonstrated all it takes to be Nigeria’s president and the natural course of succession should be allowed. “If you are following the development, one of the former heads of state, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, when a group of young Nigerians that are campaigning for the Vice President, Osinbajo visited him, he gave some words of credence for the vice president describing him as a good man. “Looking at that angle, I think the best person to succeed Buhari is Professor Yemi Osinbajo because he has the potentials, capacity, capability, qualities and experience to succeed Buhari,” he said.
