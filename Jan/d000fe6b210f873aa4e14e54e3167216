Gov Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has signed the 2022 budget of N189,617,487,624 into law. The signing, which was done at the Government House, Ilorin,  followed the passage of the budget by the State legislature. 55.3% of the total package was for capital expenditure while the recurrent stood at 44.7%. Speaking shortly after the signing, the Governor said the budget also captured workers’ promotion and the consequential adjustment component of the national minimum wage, the payment of which begins this month. “Some of the highlights of the budget included the implementation of the consequential adjustment of minimum wage and paying some salary arrears that could not be paid by the previous administration. “We are equally doing cash backing of promotions. Those are some of the major challenges for the administration,” he said. The Governor said the administration will also focus on completing ongoing infrastructural projects, job creation and expanding the economic base of the state. “We will try to ensure full implementation of the budget as much as revenue permits”, he noted. Speaking after the signing, Kwara Speaker, Yakubu Danladi-Salihu, described the budget as that of sustainable development and economic growth. “The capital votes favour projects that will touch the lives of the people and reforms that would attend to decayed infrastructure. “With these projects, our state will move to the next level infrastructural wise. “Most of the projects cut across the three senatorial districts while the recurrent also aptly caters for the people’s welfare”, he added.
