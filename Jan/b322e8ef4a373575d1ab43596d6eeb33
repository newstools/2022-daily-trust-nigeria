To ensure that the Super Eagles continue to soar at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) has launched a campaign for 10 million online supporters for Nigerians at home to lend their support to the team through online platforms. The Director General of NCAC, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, who unveiled the platform yesterday described the initiative as a concept which other African countries will take a cue from in a not too distant future. He said 10 million online supporters for the Eagles will guarantee maximum support and boost the morale of the players as they hunt for a fourth AFCON title. “I am happy we have made history. We have even got 20 million supporters. Already in one hour of launching, 54 onlines have connected to the project. Other Africans will take a cue from us,” Runsewe said. Interestingly, prominent Nigerians like former Green Eagles captain, Segun Odegbami, former DG, National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Dr Danladi Bako; former DG National Sports Commission Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye; President General Worldwide, the Nigeria Football Supporters Club, Dr Rafiu Oladipo and veteran broadcaster, Dr Peter Igho have since ratified the initiative. In a virtual interview, Odegbami described the concept as a brilliant idea noting that the Super Eagles who are presently excelling at the Africa Cup of Nations should be given all the necessary support. “Out of so many things that are going wrong in our society, our football appears to be one bright and shining star. Mobilising Nigerians to support the national team would lift the spirit of all Nigerians and give everyone hope that gradually something great can come out of the country,” Odegbami said.
