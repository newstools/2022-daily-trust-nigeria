It said the government action is aimed at destroying the daily economic activities in the state for refusing to reconcile with striking tricycle riders for the last three days.

The statement added that it is very pertinent to note that Ganduje’s administration has failed its citizens in every ramification, particularly, the state government has done nothing in the transport sector for the seven years of its existence rather it truncated the students’ transportation systems introduced by the government of Engr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. “Ganduje and his cohorts have turned the Kano Road Traffic Agency into a major revenue-generating agency instead of being a traffic regulatory agency as it was established to serve with that purpose. “Hundreds of thousands of the youth are engaged in this business and it generates both employment and state revenue, only a government without clear economic directions can fight a self-employed youth, women and other individuals at a time when the nation faces a dwindling economy and insecurity that put the citizens into abject poverty.” The party further wishes to stress that the government should as a matter of urgency address this issue because allowing this crisis to linger on retains the tendency to degenerate into chaos and disturb the prevailing peace in the state as teaming numbers of our youth are left without means of livelihood. The statement read in part, “Governor Ganduje and members of his cabinet kept mum despite being fully aware of the sufferings faced by the residents of Kano, which include but not limited to businessmen and women, civil servants, students of both in primary, secondary and tertiary schools, people seeking for medical attention in various health facilities and visitors of the state. “In these three days of tricycle strike, Kano has lost billions of naira, businesses have suffered and many offices have not been in full operations because of the strike while state government remains reluctant to take any decisive action that could rescue the situation.”
