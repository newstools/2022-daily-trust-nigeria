The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has said despite the fire that gutted a part of the train on the Warri-Itakpe train route, services will run normally. A viral video showed some NRC staff battling to put out a raging fire on a train in that corridor. The Managing Director, NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, confirmed the fire incident to our correspondent. He however said the service won’t be affected as the fire didn’t cause too serious havoc to impact on the operations. In a text message to respond to our correspondent’s inquiry, he said, “the guard of WITS 03 reported fire outbreak on CBX Power car and SP coach 00036.” He said “the train was detached and brought to Agbor station. The affected coach and the CBX have also been brought to Agbor. Cause of the fire not known yet.” On casualties, he said “No casualty. All the passengers are okay and the train dispatched to continue.” When our correspondent asked why the NRC staff were using leaves instead of fire extinguishers to put out the fire, he said the hand fire extinguishers at the stations were exhausted and they had to resort to self-help. He said the hand-held fire extinguishers were not designed to respond to such type of fire thus were inadequate. On whether there was no backup fire capability at each station to augment what is on the train, he said the NRC has firefighting equipment at each station but they cannot be moved on the rail tracks.
