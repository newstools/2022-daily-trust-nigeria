My real name is James Ikechukwu Esomughua Okelue. Okelue is my great grandfather’s name and everybody goes with that last name. Of course, from day one I figured that part out before if I knew what was going on in the industry. I said that if I’m going to embark on this journey, I’m going to go alone. I’m going to go through the trials and ups and downs that come with this journey and if it works, I’ll be the centre of it. “If it doesn’t, I’d have exempted these people from whatever comes with it. I’ve had that strategy from day one and now, there’s an extension of it to my next generation, my sons. I said, how about if I’m so famous and I can’t walk around in public places, what would happen to my relationship with my sisters? I took that decision them and said you know what? What can I take away from my name? James- Jim; Ikechukwu- Iyke. And that was it. Jim Iyke was born.”
