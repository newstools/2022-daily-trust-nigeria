The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has suspended the quarter final games scheduled for Sunday following the stampede that occurred on Monday. Though not yet approved by the CAF executive body, the president, Patrice Motsepe said the games will now be played at Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium. “I have already told the Cameroonian government. This match will be played at the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium. “We are as responsible as the Organizing Committee, as much as the Cameroonian government. We need to talk to ensure that steps are taken to ensure that what happened yesterday never happens again. A Disciplinary Committee will be created,” CAF President Patrice Motsepe announced at a press conference. Cameroon is hosting AFCON for the first time in 50 years. It was meant to host the tournament in 2019 but the event was taken away that year and awarded to Egypt because of serious concerns with Cameroon’s preparations, particularly the readiness of its stadiums. The Yaounde Olembe Stadium was one of the venues that was under scrutiny. It is the main stadium for the month-long tournament and is due to stage three more games, including the final on February 6.
