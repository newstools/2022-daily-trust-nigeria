The incident occurred around 8:28am at Kulende Junction, Sango Area of Ilorin. One of the traders at Oja-Tuntun market who spoke with Daily Trust said the incident was caused by unmonitored refuse burning by the marketers. “We later discovered that the fire has stoked for days burning beneath the refuse without the knowledge of the traders until this morning when it escalated. “But for the fire service, it would have been a major disaster in Kwara today,” the source added. While confirming the incident, the spokesperson for the Kwara State Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle, urged the public to take cognizant of the present harmattan period when involved in any fire-related activity in the state.
