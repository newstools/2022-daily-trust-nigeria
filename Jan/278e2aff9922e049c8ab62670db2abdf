Inspired by Mo Salah, the Pharaohs of Egypt fought back to secure a 2-1 win over the Atlas Lions of Morocco in extra-time of the 2021 AFCON quarter-final match played yesterday at the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo in Cameroon. In the comeback win, Liverpool star man, Mo Salah was the hero as he scored the equaliser and assisted the winning goal which took them to the semi-finals where Cameroon have been waiting after rolling over Gambia in one of the quarter-finals. At the start of the contest the Lions who were hungry for a second title after the victory in 1976 mounted pressure on the Pharaohs who struggled to keep pace with them. It was the ceaseless pressure by the Moroccans that produced an early penalty kick for them which was converted by Sofiane Boufal. The referee from Senegal had judged that Ayman Ashraf had fouled pacy PSG man Acharf Hakimi. Stung by the goal, Egypt responded almost immediately forcing goalkeeper Yassine Bounou into making two fantastic saves to maintain the lead for his side. The Moroccans took their lead into the half time break but parity was restored in the 53rd minute when Mo Salah tapped in from close range after Bounou parried a header into his deadly left foot. The match then went into extra-time where Salah eventually set up Aston Villa man Trezeguet in the 100th minute to break the hearts of the Atlas Lions with the winning goal. Meanwhile, 2019 runners up, Senegal were dominant in the other quarter-final as they overpowered giant killers Equatorial Guinea 3-1 to set up their semi-final clash with West African neighbours, Burkina Faso.
