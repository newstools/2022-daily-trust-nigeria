Manchester City took a huge step towards retaining the Premier League title as Kevin De Bruyne’s sublime strike sealed a 1-0 win against Chelsea, while the pressure mounted on Everton boss Rafael Benitez after a 2-1 loss at Norwich on Saturday. De Bruyne broke Chelsea’s stubborn resistance with 20 minutes to play at the Etihad Stadium. The Belgian midfielder escaped N’Golo Kante and bent a perfectly-placed shot into the far corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s goal from 20 yards. City’s 12th successive league win moved them 13 points clear of second placed Chelsea, effectively ending the Blues’ title aspirations. Third placed Liverpool, 14 points adrift of City with two games in hand, can close the gap with a win against Brentford on Sunday. City manager Pep Guardiola admitted it was a vital victory in his team’s bid for a fourth title in five years. But Guardiola refused to write off a late challenge from Liverpool or even Chelsea, who beat City in last season’s Champions League final. “All the players gave everything and it was an important victory because they are a big contender,” Guardiola said. “But in January no one is champion. We can think about Chelsea, and Liverpool have games in hand. If they win it will be eight points and eight points in January is nothing.” Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel appeared to send his team out with a defensive mindset. But after the game, the German was critical of Romelu Lukaku, who gave the latest in a long list of subdued displays since his club record transfer from Inter Milan last year. “Sometimes he has to do the service. He had many ball losses and a huge chance. Of course we want to serve him but he’s part of the team.” Tuchel said.
