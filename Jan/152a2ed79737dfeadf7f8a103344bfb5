A 33,000 litre fuel truck discharging naphtha and the pump bay was damaged by fire on Saturday at the  Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC). A statement by NNPC Ltd on Saturday night said the incident, which was contained in less than two hours was caused by a spark as the truck was discharging the product into a tank. “The incident affected only the discharging truck and the pump bay. No other property was damaged,” it stated. NNPC Ltd further said management officials of the refinery led by the managing director, were supervising the operation when the incident occurred and so mobilised with support from the Federal Fire Service to put out the fire. PHRC reassured residents near the facility that they have no cause to worry about the incident. Daily Trust reports that in January 2021, NNPC signed a $1.5 billion contract with Tecnimont of Italy to rehabilitate the refinery; the exercise was ongoing according to NNPC Ltd and is scheduled for completion in 2023.
