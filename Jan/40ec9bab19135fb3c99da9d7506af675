Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has appealed to the United Nations (UN) and development partners to work together to support the state government’s efforts to resettle the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at their ancestral homes with dignity. The governor made the plea when he received the new UN Acting Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Matthias Schmale, during a courtesy visit on Wednesday at the Government House, Maiduguri. He thanked the UN for the continued support and intervention to victims of insurgency in Borno State. Zulum debunked reports making the round that the Borno State Government was forcing IDPs out of camps, adding that the resettlement plan was in line with international conventions and global best practice and consultation He called on the UN and other partners to support about 50, 000 farmers that had so far returned to their communities with farm inputs and machinery Earlier, Schmale said the UN was committed to supporting federal and state governments to overcome the continued dependence on aids from developed nations to address the humanitarian and development gaps. He promised to consolidate the successes recorded by his predecessor, Edward Kallon, to improve the wellbeing of people in the North East and the county in general.
