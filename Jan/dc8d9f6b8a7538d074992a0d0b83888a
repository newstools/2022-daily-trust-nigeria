 Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, yesterday said he had nothing personal against any presidential aspirant. He also declared that his criticisms of former Lagos Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has nothing to do with his incarceration as recently insinuated by a former Ogun Governor, Mr. Segun Osoba. Addressing a press conference yesterday, George said he believes it is his “inalienable right” to examine the pedigree of individuals seeking to contest the 2023 elections. Daily Trust reports that George had attacked Tinubu moments after he declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidency. He, among other comments, described Tinubu’s declaration as a huge joke, saying the APC leader lacked the pedigree to be the president of the country. In his speech titled, “2023 and the Presidential Aspirants: Time to Speak Out,” Bode stated that every qualified citizen has the right to aspire to any leadership position “in a true, genuine democratic order.” However, he added that while it is legitimate and valid for those who are interested in governance to openly declare their aspirations, “it is also incumbent upon the rest of us as citizens of this nation to inquire, to scrutinize, to investigate, to examine in totality the qualities of those who seek our mandate.”
