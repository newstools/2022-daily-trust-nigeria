A new Orimolusi has emerged in Ijebu – Igbo, Ijebu North LGA of Ogun State, after 27 years of battle to fill the vacant first class stool. The last Orimolusi, Oba Sani Adetayo, died in May 1994 and the seat has been vacant over succession dispute. However, respite came on Tuesday when the kingmakers of the community elected Prince Lawrence Jayeola Lawrence Adebajo defeating Prince Soliu Sadiku in the election with two votes.
