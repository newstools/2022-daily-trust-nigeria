Over 300 clerics have held a special prayer session for Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, to achieve his ambition to become the president of Nigeria in 2023. The prayer session was held in Kano on Sunday. Top clerics from within and outside Kano recited the complete Qur’an during the prayer session. Gwani Sheikh Nasiru Kura, who led the session, said one of the greatest prayers practise is the recitation of the complete Qur’an and doing that for Yahaya Bello is pertinent if truly, the hope to transform and rescue Nigeria from its shackles was the priority of any concerned citizen. He added that they organised the prayer session for the governor because of his integrity, good works and exemplary style of leadership which will likely take Nigeria to greater heights. Also speaking, Gwani Ismail Zakariyya Al-Kinshawi said whoever is conversant with the news media knows how Bello had been handling the affairs of government, meeting the expectations of electorates. Yahaya Bello is the incumbent governor of Kogi State who is on his second term. He has since declared his intention to become the president of the country come 2023.
