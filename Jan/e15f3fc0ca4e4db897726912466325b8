Following the death of a former Head of the Interim Government, Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan, President Muhammadu Buhari, has directed that the national flag be flown at half-mast. The President gave the order in a statement on Tuesday night by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha. He said that the order is effective from Wednesday 12th till Friday 14th January as a mark of respect for the former Head of State who died on Tuesday 11th January, 2022 at the age of 85. Shonekan took over from Babangida on August 26, 1993, but his government was toppled by the late General Sani Abacha on November 17, 1993. Abacha, who was then Secretary Of Defence of the Interim National Government led by Shonekan, reportedly briefed the Head of the ING about the ongoing turmoil across the country with regards to the annulment of June 12 elections before taking over from him.
