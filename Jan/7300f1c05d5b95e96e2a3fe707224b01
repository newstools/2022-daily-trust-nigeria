No fewer than three police officers lost their lives on Sunday afternoon in an accident along Kubwa Expressway opposite the popular Gwarinpa Estate in the Federal Capital Territory. Daily Trust reports that the incident, which was a lone mishap, involved men of the Special Tactical Squad (STS) of the Nigeria Police. A witness at the scene identified as Musa, while speaking to one of our correspondents, said the accident occurred when one of the tyres of the speeding police van burst. He said the Police Hilux van suddenly veered off the road and entered a drainage leaving three officers among the occupants dead instantly and others injured. “I was about crossing to the next lane when the police escort van on speed suddenly lost control and crashed into the drainage. Three policemen dead on the spot,” he said. Another witness said he learnt the officers were an escort team heading to Kaduna for a special assignment. He added that some officials of the Kubwa unit command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) arrived at the scene to evacuate the bodies to hospital. When contacted, the spokesperson of FCT Police Command, Josephine Adeh, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), described the incident as sad. Adeh, while confirming the incident, said she did not know the number of casualties in the “unfortunate” development. “It is really sad we lost our officers”, Adeh told Daily Trust.
