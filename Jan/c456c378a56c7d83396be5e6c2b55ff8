As part of their demand to the federal government, the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have requested access to the local, regional and global markets, modern technology, reduction of multiple taxations, among other requirements in 2022. These demands were made by the sector after some members of the manufacturers association of Nigeria (MAN) visited the president last Wednesday. During the visit of MAN, President Muhammadu Buhari promised seamless access to long-term finance for Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs). “Nigeria should be a major player in the buoyant Africa Continental Trade Area (AFCTA) market. Nigeria MSMEs can benefit from this huge market that the AFCTA is offering when we have quality products. “The products can have good quality when MSMEs are assisted to enhance their capability, capacity and competence,” said the Director of Policy Partnership and Coordination at SMEDAN, Dr Friday Okpara. A Lagos-based businesswoman who deals in making beauty products, Mrs Fatima Muhammad noted that having access to finance would assist her business tremendously as she sometimes buys her raw materials from Ojota on credit while she pays after making and selling off the finished beauty products.
