 The two unbeaten clubs in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season, Remo Stars and Rivers United will face-off today in a winner-takes all clash in Ikenne. The winner of the potentially explosive contest will claim the summit of the league table. Remo Stars, the fascinating story of the season so far will play hosts to a reinvigorated Rivers United side at the Remo Stars Stadium, Ikenne-Remo. Both teams share two identical features: they have both amassed 18 points from eight games apiece and more significantly, both sides are the two remaining teams yet to taste defeat this term. Remo Stars who returned to the topflight at the start of the season have confounded their opponents, achieving unpredictable results spiced with panache and free-flowing football often associated with their new head coach Gbenga Ogunbote. However, their title credentials will be tested to the fullest when they come up against title contenders, Rivers United. Rivers United, apart from being unbeaten have also achieved results with style this term. They totally outclassed Enyimba in Aba on MD3 and have not looked back since then. In other fixtures that are billed for today, third placed Rangers who could not break down Remo’s defence on Wednesday, travel to Benin to face Dakkada FC who will serve their third game punishment at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium.
