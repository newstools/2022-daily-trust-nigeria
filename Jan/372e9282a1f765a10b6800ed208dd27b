The governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, has endorsed a former Senate President, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, for the 2023 presidential race. Ikpeazu maintained that the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, who has declared his intention to contest, has all it takes in the area of public service and experience to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He express his supports on Monday at his country home, Umuobiakwa in the Obingwa Local Government Area of the state where he received the former Senate President. Sen. Anyim was at the governor’s residence to inform him of his intention to contest the presidential election in 2023. “Anyim is a man whose public service credentials and experience are good enough for the Presidency of Nigeria,”, Ikpeazu stated. The governor further assured Sen. Anyim of his support as he works towards achieving his ambition to be the next Nigerian President. He noted that the issue of discussion in today’s Nigeria politics is to have a president in 2023 of Igbo’s extraction. “What matters now is just for the Igbos to be given a chance to produce the next Nigerian President. “And no other tribe in Nigeria has demonstrated practical belief in the Nigerian nation better than the Igbos as can be seen from the fact that our people live and invest heavily in every part of the country. “Also, in the South East and indeed across the country today, the credentials of Senator Anyim stand very tall,” he said. Earlier, Anyim said he came to formally inform Ikpeazu and the party leadership in the state of his plans to contest for the Presidency of the country in the 2023 elections. The former SGF said the South East is the most qualified zone in Nigeria to produce the next President going by course of equity and justice. Anyim had in October, noted that his ambition would not be tied to the zoning of the presidency to the South East by the Peoples Democratic Party.
