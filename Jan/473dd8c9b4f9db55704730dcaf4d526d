Yobe State Governor and Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has said the committee is yet to reach any decision on zoning. A list emerged on Tuesday indicating that the party had zoned its presidential and other offices ahead of the February 26 national convention and the 2023 general elections. But Buni in a statement on Wednesday by his Director General Press and Media Affairs,  Mamman Mohammed, said the list as published by a section of the media was a  figment of the author’s imagination and has nothing to do with the chairman and the party. “The Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee said the party has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to the zoning of offices. “Governor Buni urged the press to resist unverified stories and rumours and to always verify all issues related to the party assuring that the doors of the party are always open,” the statement said.
