Tennis star Novak Djokovic may be deported from Australia any moment from now as his visa has been revoked for a second time. Djokovic, who is in the country for the Australia Open, has been in the news over his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID. The Victoria state government and Tennis Australia had granted the Tennis star exemption from COVID-19 vaccination, which is part of the requirement to partake in the Australia Open, but the Australian Border Force rejected the exemption and cancelled his visa upon arrival in Melbourne. Subsequently, he was detained in a Hotel four nights in hotel detention before a court overturned that decision. After the court’s ruling, the coast was clear for Djokovic to compete but on Friday, the Australian government cancelled his visa, saying he may pose a risk to the community. “Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,” Immigration Minister, Alex Hawke, said in a statement. “The government is firmly committed to protecting Australia’s borders, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic”.
