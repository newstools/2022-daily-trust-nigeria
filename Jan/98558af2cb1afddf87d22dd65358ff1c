A Nigerian solutions and innovations company, iStrategic Transparent Solutions Ltd, has signed an agreement with a major exporter of Russian technology, Russian Software Trade House (RSTH), for the deployment of security and crime-bursting solutions. The two companies are to work in developing computer software in the areas of safety, security, cybercrime and other allied services for use by public and private institutions in Nigeria and other West African countries. This was contained in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on behalf of the two companies by Habibu Adamu Aliyu, the Chief Executive Officer of iStrategic Solutions, and Pavel Maximenko, president of RSTH. The technologies to be developed by the two entities, according to the MOU, will solely focus on “protecting, preventing and deterring the activities of criminals, insurgents and bandits”. Speaking at the signing ceremony, the president of Independence Digital said “Russia considers it its duty to spread the achievements of the Soviet school of mathematics and by extension Russian IT solutions, to countries with which it has historically had and still has friendly relations.” The CEO of iStrategic, Habibu Aliyu, said the firm was founded by some experienced former law enforcement operatives and seasoned lawyers with strong backgrounds and vast experience in complex financial crimes investigations, financial intelligence analysis, and forensic accounting.
