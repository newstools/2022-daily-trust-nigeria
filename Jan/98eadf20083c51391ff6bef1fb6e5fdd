 An Ekiti State Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Ado Ekiti has granted an ex-parte application brought before it to remand one Olukayode Adebayo, 37, in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ado Ekiti. Magistrate Mojisola Salau, in her ruling yesterday, said remanding the defendant would allow the police to complete their investigation while the prosecutor, Inspector Sadiq Adeniyi, would duplicate the case file and send it to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The police prosecutor had told the court that Olukayode, an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Ekiti State Command, allegedly raped a 13- year-old girl at Peace Avenue, Afao Road, Ado Ekiti on December 25. In her statement to the police, the victim said on Christmas day, she went to buy some bananas and kola nuts for her mother and on her way back, the defendant who was on a motorcycle met her on the road and offered her a ride home. But on their way, the officer took her to an uncompleted building and had carnal knowledge of her. Passers-by heard her crying and they took her home. She explained to her mother and later reported the incident to the police. The prosecutor said the offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 31 of the Child Right Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The magistrate adjourned the case to February 10 for mention.
