The Plateau State Police Command, on Wednesday, said it has rescued the wife of Silas Vem, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Deputy Governor of Plateau, and a medical doctor, Samuel Audu. The gunmen, in separate operations, kidnapped both Dr Samuel Audu, and Mrs Tabita Silas Vem, on Sunday evening. ASP Ubah Gabriel, who is the spokesman of the state Command told Daily Trust that both victims were rescued by the combined team of the police and other security agencies in the state but couldn’t explain whether or not ransom was given before their rescue. A source however had earlier told our correspondent that the kidnappers of Mrs Vem, had demanded N50 million before she would be released. Daily Trust reports that the medical doctor was abducted after closing from work in Barkin Ladi town of Barkin Ladi LGA of the state while the wife to deputy chief of staff, was kidnapped while entering their residence in Rayfield area of Jos South LGA of the state. The latest incident came a few days after Governor Simon Bako Lalong restated the government’s commitment to ensure that whoever was convicted of kidnapping would face the death penalty. He had said he would make the state hot for kidnappers and other criminals.
