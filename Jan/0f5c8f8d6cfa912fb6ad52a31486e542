Super Eagles defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has said the football philosophy of the team in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations is different from the squad that featured at the 2019 edition. The Leicester man who stated this during a press conference yesterday said he is not interested in personal recognition but the overall success of his team. It will be noted that Ndidi was listed among the best eleven players from the group stages by the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF). “I don’t pay attention to recognition, I just want to play football, enjoy myself, improve myself and try to help the team. It is the same team from 2019, it’s just the philosophy that is different. “It is just that our current manager has us understand and made it simple. He has given us the push to express ourselves and give us the freedom to express ourselves but must play for the team. Ndidi further refuted claims that he always ignores Nigerian media, but rather due to timing, the request comes. “I have nothing against Nigeria pressmen, but the timing. I come out to train and you come with your recorder to ask for an interview which I am not ready for. I want to train and not be interviewed. “If you want to have an interview with me, you meet the media officer of the team, request for an interview, send in your questions and I will get to talk to you in a more relaxed moment,” he noted.
