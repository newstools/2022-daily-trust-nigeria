Fuel scarcity has continued to hit Jos, the capital city of Plateau State, with motorists lamenting over the development. Vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles were seen in their numbers queuing at various stations to buy the fuel. Our correspondent, who went to some of the filling stations within the city yesterday, reported that the majority of them were not operating with their entrances barricaded. The few dispensing the products were congested by motorists who are queuing to buy petrol. Daily Trust gathered that there were similar reports of fuel scarcity in Bukuru, the headquarters of Jos South LGA with long queues seen at various filling stations of the area. Operators of black markets who sell the product in gallons have also taken advantage of the scarcity of the product to extort buyers. Motorists alleged that the scarcity of the fuel could be connected to hoarding by the owners of filling stations in their underground tanks, adding that some of the stations have taken advantage of the situation to increase the price of the product. Subsequently, the Plateau State Government recently, through the Secretary to the State Government, Danladi Atu, directed the state’s road task force to shut down and auction fuel at stations found hoarding petrol.
