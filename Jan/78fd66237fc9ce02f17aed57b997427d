The federal government has trained Sanitation Desk Officers (SDOs) across the 20 local government areas (LGAs) in Ogun State to promote toilet uptake in ending the practice of open defecation in the state. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development and Water Resources, Mr Adetunji Kanimodo, said the state government would continue to support the federal government’s policies of eradicating open defecation. He, therefore, enjoined the SDOs to take the training serious and use the knowledge gained for the betterment of their communities.
