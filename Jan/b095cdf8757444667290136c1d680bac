Andy Murray says it is “positive” that Novak Djokovic has been released from detention in Australia but the Serb still has “a few questions” to answer. World number one Djokovic, 34, won a court battle that overturned his visa cancellation on Monday, a week before the Australian Open is set to start. But Australian border officials are investigating whether his travel entry form included a false declaration. “It’s positive that he’s not in detention any more,” said Murray. “There are still a few questions that need to be answered around the isolation, which I’m sure we’ll hear from him in the next few days.” Djokovic’s travel declaration form, which all visitors have to complete three to seven days before arrival, stated he did not travel in the 14 days before his flight to Australia. However, social media posts appear to show him in both Serbian capital Belgrade and Spain during that period. Australia’s immigration minister still has powers to re-cancel the visa and deport the unvaccinated player.
