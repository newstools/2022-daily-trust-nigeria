There were protests on Wednesday at the Kirikiri Lighter Terminal (KLT) Lagos over the death of a clearing agent who was crushed by a mobile crane while positioning a container for Customs examination on Tuesday. Over 100 members of the KLT Chapter of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) stormed Phase 2 of the terminal operated by Joatelim Logistics Ltd over what they described as negligence in operations which caused the death of 46-year-old ANLCA member Mr Kennedy Ikechukwu. He was confirmed dead at the Naval Hospital Ajegunle and a condolence register has been opened at ANLCA secretariat. Chairman of the KLT chapter of ANLCA, Comrade Goddy Sewa Soleji l who addressed newsmen, said the negligence must be addressed. “ANLCA is insisting that the terminal operator should correct its operational lapses, which includes lack of adequate equipment and good working environment for customers.” He said the challenges at the terminal had been reported to the relevant security agencies at the ports and to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) earlier with no improvement. When contacted via telephone, the General Manager Operations at the Joatelim terminal, Akinlolu Oni, said the management was still discussing with the family of the deceased and that they are yet to reach any conclusion. “We did not operate on Wednesday but hopefully we will open for business on Thursday after the meeting with members of the deceased family. The incident is quite unfortunate. Nobody prayed for such to happen,” Oni noted.
