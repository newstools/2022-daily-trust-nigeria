The Ya Zarah Orphan Care Foundation has graduated 16 orphans, who have also been admitted into El-Kanemi College Of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri, Borno State, where they will continue their basic and secondary education, with their school and feeding fees fully paid. The orphanage based in Potiskum Yobe state was established by the former deputy governor of Yobe state and now Nigeria’s minister of Power Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu. Named after the minister’s mother Ya Zarah, the orphanage provides children with shelter, food, medical and social care under the supervision of experienced educationists and childhood specialists. In the last five years, the Ya Zarah Orphans Foundation carters for children orphaned as a result of the insurgency in the northeast and other reasons. At the graduation ceremony in Potiskum, the Minister of Power who is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees Ya Zarah Orphan Care Foundation Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu, noted that apart from making sure that orphans are given the care every child deserved, providing them with free education is one of the key objectives of Ya Zara Orphan Care Foundation. The minister, who was represented at the occasion by Yobe’s Commissioner for Higher Education, Prof. Muhammed Munkaila, also said, plans are underway to construct shops and donate them as endowment to generate revenue for the sustainability of the Orphanage Home. “Like I indicated during the opening of the home five years ago, this service in the way of Allah is open to the entire community so that collectively we can provide the enabling environment to these orphans to realise their full potentials and grow up to give back to society,” the minister added. One of the Orphans, Ahmad Adamu Daye thanked the Minister of Power and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Ya Zarah Orphan Care Foundation, Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu, for the initiatives which he said helped immensely in alleviating the sufferings of the orphans in the area.
