Widows of Nigeria’s fallen heroes in Ebonyi State, on Saturday, begged the federal government to employ them or their children. Chairperson of Nigeria Military Widows Association, Ebonyi State Council, Mrs Margret Ugoagha, who spoke on behalf of her members, noted that it would help them in addressing the suffering they are presently undergoing after the demise of their husbands. Mrs Ugoagha made this demand on Saturday when marking this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day in honour of Nigerian fallen heroes, held at the Unity Square in Abakiliki, Ebonyi State capital. According to her, “Our widows are not employed except few that were employed by the cantonment. “So, I’m pleading with the federal government to help and employ us essentially those that have matured children or graduates
should also be given employment. “The reason is that if they have something doing there will be fewer problems in our family, society and nation at large”, she said.
