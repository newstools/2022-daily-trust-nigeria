The newly elected president of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), FCT chapter, Comrade Ibrahim Abdullahi Kabi, said the union will synergise with the six area council chairmen towards ensuring that backlogs of staff arrears are paid to them. Comrade Kabi, while speaking with our reporter in Abuja, yesterday, said the non-payment of its members’ arrears is one of the many challenges the union will be tackling headlong. He said though he was yet to get the exact amount as he just assumed office, the union will sit down to ascertain the total backlogs of its members unpaid arrears by the six council chairmen.
