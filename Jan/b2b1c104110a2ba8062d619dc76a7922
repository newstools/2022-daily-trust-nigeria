Host nation, Cameroon are three games away from clinching the coveted trophy but will first have to overcome debutants Gambia in their quarter-final clash this evening in Douala. The fixture might look easy on paper but Gambia have proven to be no pushover at the tournament and will look to stun the Indomitable Lions on home soil. However, Cameroon boast the quality and experience needed at this stage of the tournament and head into today’s game unbeaten in each of their last eight games across all competitions, picking up an impressive seven wins and one draw since a 2-1 loss in their match with Ivory Coast back in September in a World Cup qualification clash. The Indomitable Lions also enjoyed an unbeaten run in the group stages, claiming successive wins over Burkina Faso and Ethiopia in their opening two games, before being held to a 1-1 draw by Cape Verde in their final group game and a 2-1 victory over Comoros in the Round of 16 clash. Led by the leading goal scorer, Vincent Aboubakar, Cameroon are full of confidence judging by their performances and will look ahead to victory over the Gambians who have made a decent and memorable debut at the AFCON. The Scorpions will look to cause another major upset today after claiming three wins and keeping three clean sheets from their four games. The lowest ranked side who are making their first continental appearance kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 victory over Mauritania on January 12, before holding out for an impressive 1-1 draw with Mali four days later. Tom Saintfiet’s men wrapped up the group stages in style as they stunned Tunisia1-0 at the Limbe Omnisport Stadium last Thursday courtesy of a 93rd-minute winner from Ablie Jallow. Gambia’s penchant for causing upset was again made manifest when they secured a hard fought 1-0 win over Guinea and will look to enact that at the Stade Japoma, Douala.
