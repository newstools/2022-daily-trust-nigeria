Ardova Plc recently held a ground-breaking ceremony to commemorate the ongoing construction of its new world-class Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage facility at the company’s Ijora-Lagos campus. The LPG facility will sit on 8.8 hectares and has a combined storage capacity of 20,000 metric tonnes. Olumide Adeosun, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ardova, said, “This event marks an important step in our evolution to an integrated energy company, as it draws us closer to our projection of a future where renewables and cleaner fuels represent a considerable segment of our product offering and balance sheet. “When completed, it will be West Africa’s largest LPG storage complex, placing Ardova at the top of the industry in receiving, blending, storing and distributing the product to both commercial and retail customers.” He noted that the company was also particularly interested in the improved socio-economic prospects it portended for citizens, especially rural consumers whose reliance on biomass such as firewood made them vulnerable to attendant health risks and reduced much-needed ground cover provided by trees at an alarming speed. He said, “By December, 2022, when construction is completed, we will have a facility that will be both best in class and future-ready.”
