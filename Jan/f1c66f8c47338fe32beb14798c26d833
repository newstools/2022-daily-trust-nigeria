Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) has warned Agate Integrated Services Ltd to desist from parading itself as a technical partner in the council’s revenue generation on mobile advert rates. The Director of Administration of AMAC, Alhaji Yahaya Kana, issued the warning in a letter addressed to the Managing Director of Agate Integrated Services, dated December 16, 2021 obtained by journalists at the weekend in Abuja. Kana explained that collection of mobile advert revenue was outside the mandate of the company. The director said if the company continued to collect mobile advert revenue, AMAC would not hesitate to disengage them immediately. “This is an infraction on the terms of your engagements. Please be guided accordingly in the conduct of your activities. “Sequel to your response to the query issued to your company by AMAC on the collection of mobile advert rates from AMAC residents, I am directed to inform you that the engagement of your company to aid revenue generation is restricted to daily ticketing only, not mobile advert. ”Consequently, your company is hereby warned to desist from parading itself as a technical partner to aid revenue generation on mobile advert,” the statement said. The management of the company was not immediately available as at press time to react to the letter from the AMAC. Hussaini Yahaya
