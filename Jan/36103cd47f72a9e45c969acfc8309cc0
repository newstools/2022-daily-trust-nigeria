The young men started to make noise to prevent a search. “The operatives introduced themselves as officers of NDLEA and submitted themselves for search before entry. This was done and a search was conducted. The search led to the recovery of drug exhibits including cannabis Sativa; Tramadol 225mg, and some paraphernalia for drug use. This was after the suspect had requested to record on video the search, which the officers out of a sense of civility allowed. “The video trending on social media was the moment the suspect and his friends decided to disrupt the bid to conduct a search of the house,” Babafemi said. He also said that in his confessional statement in custody, the suspect admitted ownership of the drugs recovered from his house. Skit maker, D-General, 3 others arrested with illicit drugs in Lagos raid —NDLEA
