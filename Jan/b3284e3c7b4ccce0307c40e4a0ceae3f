 A former Green Eagles goalkeeper, Etta Egbe, has observed with satisfaction that the Nigerian senior national football team is improving with every match at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Therefore, the former international is among those who feel the Super Eagles have the prospect of winning the 33rd edition of Africa’s most prestigious football competition. In an interview in Calabar, Egbe reiterated that after convincing wins against the most successful nation in AFCON history, Egypt and Sudan in Group B, the Super Eagles are among the top favourites. Egbe said he believes that as they play more matches in the tournament, the Super Eagles will even get better. “Nigeria’s performance at AFCON has so far been impressive. Their performance no doubt is an indication that if they maintain the momentum, they can bring home the trophy. “Our expectation is that as the team progress in the championship, the players will continue to get better. They are doing well but it is important to keep supporting them. They must not become complacent,” he advised. Egbe who is now a coach also commended the Super Eagles for playing as a team and with confidence. “From the confidence they have displayed so far and the spirit in the team, I believe they will reach the finals,” said Egbe.
