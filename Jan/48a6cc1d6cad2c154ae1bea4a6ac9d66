He spoke when he inaugurated the Road Transport Employers’ Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) multi-million-naira national secretariat, first to be established in 43 years of existence. The one-storey building secretariat containing several offices and conference hall is situated at Wuse Zone 5, in the nation’s capital. “The government should continue to do what it can to help your industry thrive. We will also continue investing significantly in road transport which will expand your routes.” Secretary to the Government of Federation, Boss Mustapha, commended the proactiveness of the union with the government to improve on the transportation sector, in ameliorating the transportation problems in Nigeria. Mustapha, who was represented by Dr Habiba Lawal, the Permanent Secretary, Ecological Project Office (EPO), said that RTEAN was a union backed by law and committed to the transformation and reformation of the transportation sector of Nigeria’s economy. “It is therefore a matter of necessity that RTEAN will continue to transform the sector in line with the best global practice.
