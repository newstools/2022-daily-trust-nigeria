How committed, visionary leadership can impact generations – Osinbajo Let Peace Reign, Yahaya Bello Urges Kogi Residents The INEC chairman said this in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on Sunday during the West Africa (ECOWAS) Youth Council summit. According to him, the two demographics have the highest voting population in the country and they are the largest INEC stakeholders for the forthcoming polls. “On the day of the election, you observed that about 70 per cent are youths and women. But the same youths are the ones used by politicians to cause violence and snatch ballot boxes and that should not be the case. They can achieve more together to improve and strengthen the political process”.
