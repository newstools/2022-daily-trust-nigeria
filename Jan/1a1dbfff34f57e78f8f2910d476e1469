Award-winning singer, Tiwa Savage, says she wished Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, was her father. Savage took to her Snapchat story on Thursday to lament the difficulty that comes along with making money. She wrote; “I have one more meeting. It’s not easy looking for money o. God help me, but why my papa no be Dangote or something like that (may his soul Rest in Peace though).” The musician’s father died on July 19, 2021, and was buried in Lagos shortly after the release of her extended play project ‘Water and Garri’. While announcing her father’s demise on Social Media, the singer described him as a courageous man. “You fought till the very end, you really fought daddy, it’s been rough for you these past couple of years but you are resting now. This is tough on me, I’m so numb, so weak. Rest In Perfect Peace, my King. I love you, daddy. Savy t’eko, pappin K,” the ‘Eminado’ crooner had posted on Instagram.
