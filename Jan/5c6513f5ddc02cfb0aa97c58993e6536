 A former Minister of Information and Communication, Alhaji Ikra Aliyu Bilbis, has called on leaders of the All Progressives  Congress (APC) to desist from attitudes that promote division within the party and work together for its overall success ahead of the the 2023 general elections. Bilbis, in a statement in Abuja, said the call became necessary in view of the rancour and acrimony generated over the bid by vested interests to corner certain positions within the party ahead of the 2023 elections. Alhaji Ikra, who is one of the prominent leaders of th.e party in Zamfara State, said as 2023 was fast approaching, APC could not afford to allow the current turmoil within its ranks to persist, but must put its house in order to enable it plan well to win massively in the 2023 elections. He warned that without unity of purpose among the leaders and other party members, APC might lose to the opposition. He said, “We are yet to come out of the crises that rocked most state chapters of the party during the congresses, and our national convention is still ahead while the jostle for the presidential and other tickets of the party has started “Leaders of the party should be prevailed upon to sacrifice their selfish interests where they clash with the overall interest of the party in order to give others a sense of belonging in the party. “We cannot afford to be complacent as there is a big hurdle before us to cross before 2023, so we must swallow our pride to do the right thing by coming together.” Ahead of the party’s national convention, Alhaji Ikra said it was important that the APC elected a well experienced and committed person to lead it irrespective of where the person came from.
