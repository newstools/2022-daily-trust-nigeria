Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, has said that his side will not give room for complacency ahead of their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, tie against Sudan. Nigeria will face Sudan in their second AFCON fixture at the Stade Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua, on Saturday. Speaking after their session on the training pitch at the Stade Roumdé Adjia, the Watford star revealed that the team will approach the game with the same commitment, attitude as they did against Egypt on Tuesday. “The whole team defended very well and they [Egypt] didn’t have many chances and I think we played some nice game of football, which is always exciting. “Having said that, I don’t think we should believe in the hype going into the game against Sudan. Every game for us is going to be a big game. “We are going to approach it the same way we did against the Egyptians. Game by game, we are going to go further. So, we will keep cool and stay humble as we have got all it takes to get over the Sudanese,” he said. Meanwhile, assistant coach, Joseph Yobo, has claimed that Sudan and Guinea-Bissau have similar playing styles. Nigeria is in Group D at the ongoing 2021 AFCON in Cameroon, alongside Sudan, Egypt and Guinea-Bissau.
