Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo has threatened to shoot anyone that messes around with her children. The mother of two made this known while reacting to a video posted by comedienne, Princess, on her Instagram page.

Even the animal kingdom is not this bad. “Our society stigmatizes even threaten victims & their parents while the perpetrators like #Babaijesha walk freely. Heartless rape apologists like #Yomifabiyi insist on video evidence & promote #Childpornography (in their movies) while insensitive #Punchnewspaper promotes the same madness on their page for traction When will this madness stop?!!! our children are being destroyed daily & most people see it as cruise Awon oloriburuku gbogbo. Aja Aloma je oku yin loruko Jesu! God bless our champions.”(sic) While calling on the use of guns to be legalised in the country, Iyabo Ojo responded to the post and said, “Can dey just legalise guns bcos some demons need to be taken out asap.
