While First Bank Ladies defeated Delta Force 25-22 in Game Five, Nigeria Customs were 31-17 winners over Plateau Rocks in Game Six. Speaking during the opening ceremony, the organiser of the championship, Igoche Mark, said this is just one of the many interventions to revive domestic basketball in Nigeria. He assured lovers of Basketball in Nigeria that plans were being perfected to have the tournament played constantly across the country, in a format replicating the NBA regular season games. Mark said that the New Face of Basketball is a project focused on reviving the domestic component of the slam and dunk game. The NBBF presidential aspirant also lamented how the league and grassroots aspects of Basketball in Nigeria were deflated for a very long time and unable to bounce, and asked all stakeholders to rally around him as one united family to sustain the momentum.
