The National flag is currently flying at half-mast in Nigeria’s seat of power and other parts of the country in honour of Chief Ernest Shonekan, former head of Nigeria’s Interim Government. President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered flags to fly at half-mast nationwide as a mark of respect for Shonekan. Below are some flags at Aso Rock.
