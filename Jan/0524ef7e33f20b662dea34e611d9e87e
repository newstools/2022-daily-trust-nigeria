The Kaduna Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has said it generated N8.4 billion between January and November 2021. It said the money generated in 2021 was higher than the N8.1 billion generated in 2020. The command’s Area Comptroller, Sanusi Abubakar in an interview with newsmen in Kaduna over the weekend on the activities of the command during the period under review said excise duty generated from factories was the main source of revenue. He however explained that containers are brought to Kaduna on transfer via the inland dry port from Lagos or Port Harcourt from time to time, while the duties are paid after the containers are examined in Kaduna. According to him, “Our revenue comes from few factories within the state where they receive excise duty and also the dry port.” He called on Nigerians to utilize the dry port to ease the movement of their goods. On the activities of smugglers, he disclosed that a patrol team is always on standby and ready to swing into action based on intelligence reports. He recalled that there was an incident that occurred around Zaria, in Dan Magaji where a vehicle was intercepted with a Federal Government number plate, noting that “we almost lost one of our one of our officer from the attack by smugglers.” He however disclosed plans by the command in 2022 to achieve more successes with collaborations from various stakeholders and warned smugglers to keep away from Kaduna or embrace legitimate businesses. While emphasising the need to be more patriotic and corporate with the government on its policies to move the economy forward, the comptroller called on Nigerians to be more patriotic, saying, “Most of the problems faced in the previous year were as a result of lack of patriotism.”
