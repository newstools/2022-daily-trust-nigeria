The apex traditional indigenous group in Ibadanland, the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), has urged the Oyo State Government and the Ibadan kingmakers in Ibadanland to install High-Chief Lekan Balogun as the new Olubadan before March for the smooth celebration of Ibadan Cultural Festival. President General of CCII, Yemisi Adeaga, who stated this at a press conference heralding the annual festival, said all issues relating to succession to the throne would soon be laid to rest. He noted that this year’s cultural festival calendar had already been concluded before the death of the late Olubadan, Oba Soliu Adetunji. He explained that the program aimed to promote culture, tradition and developmental program that had already taken place in Ibadanland. “The festival would showcase to the world that Ibadan is made up of great men and women and people of great standard in terms of human capacity and developmental project,” he said.
