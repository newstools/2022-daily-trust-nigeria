A shopping complex on Saturday was gutted by an inferno that also left properties worth millions of naira destroyed. The incident occurred around 8:28am at Kulende Junction, Sango Area of Ilorin. Although the facility is a 24-room shopping complex, only four shops were affected before men of the Kwara State Fire Service were able to put the fire off. It was gathered the inferno emanated due to the careless attitude of a resident in the area who set some abandoned tyres on fire. Speaking on the incident, the HOD, Media and Publicity of the fire service, Hassan Adekunle, called for vigilance. “Director of the Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, has urged citizens to always be at alert for any forms of naked fire in their neighbourhoods especially in this harmattan season,” he added.
