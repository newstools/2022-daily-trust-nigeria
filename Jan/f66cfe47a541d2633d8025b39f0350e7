Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has ordered all the 23 local government area chairmen to hire bulldozers and destroy all identified illegal crude oil bunkering and artisanal refineries in the state. The governor also asked the Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, to provide adequate security for the chairmen during the exercise. Wike gave the order yesterday during a meeting with the chairmen and heads of security agencies in the state at the Government House, Port Harcourt. The governor, according to a press statement issued yesterday by his Special Assistant on Media, Kevin Ebiri, promised that he would not relent in the fight.
