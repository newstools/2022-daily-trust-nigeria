The Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation is working with the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) to produce charts that will enhance the safety and security of air travel across the country and beyond. The Surveyor-General of the Federation, Abuduganiyu Adebomehin, disclosed this to newsmen in Abuja Wednesday after a meeting with a delegation from NAMA. He described the collaboration as a national assignment. He said his office had the capacity to provide the best of charts and maps which would also be made available to stakeholders for improved internally generated revenue for the government. The leader of the delegation, Asifat Badmus, said the collaboration would help NAMA provide charts that would meet the International Civil Aviation standards. NAMA, according to him, needs updated topographical maps and charts as well as the data from OSGoF to function.
