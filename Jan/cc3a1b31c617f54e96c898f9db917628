The Super Eagles of Nigeria will square off with Tunisia in the round of 16 stage of the African Cup of Nations following the North African nation finishing one of four best losers at the group stage. The Carthage Eagles lost 1-0 to Gambia on Thursday night to finish third in Group E on three points, but this was good enough for Tunisia to scramble into the knockout rounds. Both Eagles met at the bronze medal match at AFCON 2019 in Egypt with Nigeria getting the better of Tunisia 1-0 thanks to Odion Ighalo’s goal. Algeria, however, crashed out of the tournament following a 3-1 loss to Ivory Coast, the defending champions failing to scale through the group stage.
The Desert Foxes also became the 12th AFCON champions to crash out in the first round when defending the trophy. Gambia wrote its own history by advancing to the knockout stage in its first ever AFCON appearance with the win over Tunisia. RESULTS Ivory Coast 3-1 Algeria
Mali 2-0 Mauritania
Sierra Leone 0-1 Equatorial Guinea
Gambia 1-0 Tunisia
