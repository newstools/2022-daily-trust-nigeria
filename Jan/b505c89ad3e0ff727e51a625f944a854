After 0-0 in regulation and extra-time, the Round of 16 match played yesternight at the Japoma Stadium in Douala went into penalties where the Pharaohs defeated Ivory coast 5-4 to move to the next stage.

The victory has kept the Pharaohs hopes of an eighth AFCON title alive. They presently hold the record of the highest number of AFCON titles which is seven. Egypt’s quarterfinal showdown with Morocco will be staged in Yaounde on Sunday, January 30.
