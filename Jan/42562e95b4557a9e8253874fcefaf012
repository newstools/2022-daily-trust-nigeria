The leader of one of the All Progressives Congress (APC) factions in Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero, has said political calamity awaits the party in the state if it fails to be fair to all members. He insisted that the imposition of leaders in the party is unacceptable. Sen Aliero made this known on Sunday when he was treated to a reception in Birnin Kebbi. The APC chieftain said he was overwhelmed with the turnout for the occasion. According to him, the turnout indicated that members of the party were not comfortable with the way the party was being run, leading to the imposition of party officials. He explained that his faction had opened an office at the state headquarters, imploring party faithful to open one at their local government headquarters down to the wards level. “There would be severe consequences if APC in Kebbi State fails to be fair to all. “During the last congress of the party, some members were selfishly removed as leaders while others were imposed to take over their positions. “We will not allow that to be and it will remain unacceptable.” When contacted, the factional chairman of the party in the state, Abubakar Kana Zuru, said there was no imposition in the party as all that are in the leadership positions were duly elected.
