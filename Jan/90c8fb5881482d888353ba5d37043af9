The Super Eagles of Nigeria scored a first-half goal to defeat Egypt 1-0 win in their opening African Cup of Nations (AFCON) match at the Roumdé Adjia stadium in Garoua, Cameroon, on Tuesday. Kelechi Iheanacho’s well taken goal proved the matchwinner as Nigeria recorded its first win over Egypt in the third opening day AFCON meeting between both nations. Nigeria also made it four wins in nine AFCON matches against Egypt. The Super Eagles started the better side with direct running on the wings, especially from Moses Simon on the left wing. Despite the pitch denying both teams zip on the ball, Nigeria adapted better and Simon could only shoot the side netting when played through on goal. Coach Augustin Eguavoen’s side deservedly went ahead on 30 minutes through Iheanacho. The self-styled Senioman Kelz controlled Aribo’s header before planting a half-volley into the left top corner for his 11th international goal. Iheanacho and Awoniyi linked up severally in the match, the former finding the later for a shot that was held by goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy as the Eagles went into the break with a deserved lead. Nigeria again started the better side in the second half, Simon shooting wide before Awoniyi’s header was tipped onto the bar by El Shenawy as Nigeria went in search for a second goal. The Pharaohs’ double substitutions meant the match became an end-to-end encounter, Salah denied by Maduka Okoye while Kelechi and substitute Chidera Ejuke also went close for the Eagles. The Eagles backline, however, stifled Carlos Quiroz’s men to claim all three points, going top of Group D while Egypt sank to the bottom. Nigeria will face Sudan in their second game on Saturday, at the same stadium.
