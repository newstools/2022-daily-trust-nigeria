The National Universities Commission (NUC) has granted approval to Uma Ukpai School of Theology (UUST), Uyo, Akwa Ibom, affiliated with the University of Uyo to run BA Religious Studies. The approval, conveyed to the Vice Chancellor of UNIUYO, Prof. Nyaudoh Ndaeyo, via a letter signed by the Director of Academic Planning of NUC, Dr Noel Biodun Saliu, followed a resource verification assessment visit to the school by a panel that assessed the proposed course and facilities. “I am directed to inform the VC that the executive secretary has considered and approved the establishment of the underlisted programme, to be run in the main campus of the institution,” the letter reads in part. According to the Registrar of Uma Ukpai School of Theology, Mrs Eunice Madu, the institution has the vision to produce leaders that are passionate for the glory of God and the development of just and inclusive societies. Founded by Rev. Dr Uma Ukpai in 2009, Madu made known that the university has produced men and women who have become relevant in society by doing exploits for God. ‘’In 2009, the school matriculated 36 students and in 2011, it successfully graduated her first set of 36 students. On June 1, 2017, the school started the process of affiliation with the University of Uyo and on July 31, 2019, during the 115th meeting of Senate the approval was granted. ‘’Consequently, on October 18, 2019, the school successfully signed a memorandum of understanding with UNIUYO on the affiliation, thereby, paving way for a three-man team from NUC together with an affiliation team from the university to visit Uma Ukpai School of Theology, Uyo, for resource verification exercise on September 8th, 2021,” she stated.
