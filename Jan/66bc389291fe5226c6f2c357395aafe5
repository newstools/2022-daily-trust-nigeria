The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, has charged civil servants to evolve policies that will reposition the entire civil service and strengthen good governance. The minister gave the charge while declaring open the 43rd meeting of the National Council on Establishments (NCE) on Thursday at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. Malam Bello commended the civil servants, particularly those from the nation’s capital, for working tirelessly in the last three decades in beautifying and building the capital city. While describing it as an honour to be selected to host the 43rd NCE, Malam Bello hinted that the civil service of the federation was a bastion of stability and solidity upon which successive governments relied on for formulation and implementation of policies, as well as extant rules. He added that as the custodian of institutional memory, civil servants were in the best position to reposition the service with a view to impacting positively on the quality of governance. The minister, who declared the meeting open, charged participants to use the opportunity of the interaction to boost their knowledge. Malam Bello commended the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Folasade Yemi-Esan, for bringing about revolutionary changes in the service and urged all civil servants to do their best in implementing the tremendous changes. Urging the participants to evolve useful recommendations through their deliberations, Bello called on the Heads of Civil Service of states to also introduce positive changes in their respective states to improve the lives of Nigerians. Earlier, the Head of Service of the Federation, Mrs Yemi-Esan, said the meeting was an annual event aimed at brainstorming on matters affecting governance at all levels. Also speaking, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on establishment and Public Service, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, charged civil servants to remain committed to exemplary conduct.
