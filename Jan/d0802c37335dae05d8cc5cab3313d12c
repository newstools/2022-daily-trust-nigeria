Fire has razed no fewer than 250 shops at Obi Isiedo foodstuff market, Okpuno-Egbu, Umudim, in Nnewi, Anambra State. Daily Trust gathered that the shops were gutted by fire on the night of January 1. A source said that the fire started around 10pm on Saturday night at one of the shops and immediately spread to others. The source said seven water tankers were mobilised to the scene which could not stop the fire. A resident near the market whose house was torched, Rev Chinedu Dike, said no one could explain what was responsible for the fire outbreak. “As you can see, my house is near the market. I came back from some functions and was taking my rest when around 9.30pm we heard an outcry that the market was on fire. “People started running helter-skelter looking for help and water tanker suppliers were contacted who mobilised up to seven tanks of water to quench the fire to no avail. “Firefighters came but the fire was already advanced. “Goods worth millions of naira were destroyed. My two-storey building under construction was about to be consumed but I struggled to save the situation and received some bruises in the process,” he said. He put the figure of the burnt shops at between 250 and 300 stocked with goods. He appealed to the Anambra State government, organisations and individuals to come to the rescue of the fire victims. The Director of Anambra State Fire Service, Martin Agbili, who confirmed the fire incident, said no life was lost. He said the fire started at about 10pm. He thanked the public, security agencies and his men for ensuring the safety of the residents.
