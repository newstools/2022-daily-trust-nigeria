Youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have thrown their weight behind the current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Sen George Akume, as the next national chairman of the party. The youths, led by Abubakar Aliyu, Galadiman Takai, said their endorsement of Akume was based on his political knowledge and experience, as well as his potential to move the party forward. Speaking with Daily Trust in Kaduna, Aliyu said, “Before arriving at our decision, we consulted far and wide, we also sought the opinions of our elders, religious and traditional leaders. It is based on this that we have concluded that Akume is the only candidate fit to stir the affairs of the party.” While describing him as a true Nigerian who is not sentimental, Aliyu said the best way for the APC to emerge victorious in the upcoming general elections in 2023 was for Akume to become the national chairman. Aliyu said, “Akume is one politician that has the party at heart; he always wants to know how the party is fairing and looks for ways to improve the party, which is why President Muhammadu Buhari should consider him as the national chairman to move the party forward.” He also urged other party members to rally round Akume in order to uplift the party.
