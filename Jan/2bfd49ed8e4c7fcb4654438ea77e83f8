The Federal Capital Territory, (FCT) Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat (ARDS) has reiterated its commitment to facilitating a sustainable food system to enable the country reap the benefits of organic agriculture. Speaking shortly before inaugurating the FCT Organic Agriculture Innovation Platform/Technical Advisory Committee in his office, the secretary of the ARDS, Mallam Abubakar Ibrahim, said it had been saddled with the responsibility of steering and guiding organic agriculture initiatives in the territory. He said the benefits associated with organic agriculture could not be over-emphasised, especially in relation to health hazards, as well as harmful effects to the environment and biodiversity associated with conventional methods of agricultural production. Mallam Ibrahim said that as part of the efforts to facilitate a sustainable food system, the secretariat recently launched a sensitisation campaign for farmers/extension agents, as well as media programmes to create awareness on organic agriculture. He also said the process of generating databases for organic agricultural practitioners in the territory had also been set in motion, with a view to channelling interventions appropriately. The secretary said the inauguration of the committee was an indication that the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) was desirous to make the practice of organic agriculture a reality in the FCT, adding, “We have taken our time. We have used this time to train our farmers and officers, as well as help desk officers. “We now have a desk officer that is handling this programme in the FCT. Sensitisation has been going on and we have been training our farmers on the importance and health challenges. We will continue with the scope of our sensitisation and the capacity building to train our extension agents,”
