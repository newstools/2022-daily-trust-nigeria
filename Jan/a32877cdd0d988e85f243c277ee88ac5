The President of Cameroon Football Federation, Samuel Eto’o, has denied the involvement of the host nation in the testing of players for the COVID-19 as he said testing is under the control of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Speaking during a televised program yesterday and monitored by our correspondent, the Cameroon legend said he will never accept cheating on the field of play. It will be noted that Cameroon has been accused of influencing the COVID-19 results of some countries so that some players will not play. The accusations became clearer and louder when 9 first-team players from Comoros were ruled off the game with Cameroon after testing positive. “Regarding testing, I would like to remind journalists and fans who are launching into criticism that Cameroon is not associated with COVID testing. They criticised my country and myself, but the truth is that it is exclusively CAF that manages the COVID tests. “Tunisia had 7 players tested positive and were going to play against Nigeria. It was not a Cameroon game. Further, Gabon had also been affected by the pandemic. The matches follow each other but are not the same. “I was a great champion and I won everything in the stadiums. At no time have I cheated and I never accept cheating in my life. So let it stop. “I have never accepted cheating. I will not accept it. The agency chosen to do the COVID tests is 100% under the control of CAF, the Cameroonian government does not manage the COVID tests, I humbly wish that my country is respected,” he declared.
