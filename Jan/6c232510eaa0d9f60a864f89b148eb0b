The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State are in a war of words over the achievements of the APC-led administration of Governor Nasir El-Rufai in the state. Daily Trust reports that the PDP Chairman, Felix Hassan Hyat, had in his New Year message described the APC government in Kaduna as the worst, saying the opposition party was now determined to hold the government to account and return sanity to the state. Hyat had advised Nigerians to reflect on the “terrible things” that have befallen thousands of citizens in the last year and urged them not to forget that hundreds of communities have been reduced to rubble as well as the countless number of those maimed and the several hundreds of school children kidnapped. He condemned what he described as the arbitrary sack of civil servants without entitlements, demolition of markets and systematic takeover of landed properties of private citizens across the state’s urban centres, and the “bastardization of traditional and religious institutions.” However, APC while responding said the people of Kaduna will not allow “nonentities” to set them back, adding that governing Kaduna was not a grand comedy. The party in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Salisu Tanko Wusono, stated that since 2015, the APC has placed Kaduna State on the path of sustainable progress and development, adding that through policy, legislative reforms and visible projects, El-Rufai has implemented the APC’s manifesto and showed that quality governance is possible in the state. While listing several achievements of the APC-led government, the ruling party said the people of Kaduna will reject “a party that for 16 years was unable to do much to either inspire progress and development or deliver good governance.”
