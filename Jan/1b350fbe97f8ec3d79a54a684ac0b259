Interim Super Eagles coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has revealed that he will be focusing on penalties as his side prepares for the Round of 16 at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Speaking at the mixed zone after his side defeated Guinea-Bissau 2-0, Eguavoen said he will go into the Round of 16 with the same approach he had used in the previous games. He further said he will not allow the successes achieved so far affect the psyche of the players ahead of the next round. “We will go into our next games with the same approach, same aggression and train more in penalties. “All credit goes to the players. They did what we asked them to do. A lot of people felt we were not good enough for the tournament because of our performances in the past few months. “For some reasons, people wrote us off but from the first game, we collectively came together and won the game. After our games, people are beginning to respect Nigeria but we will not allow it to get to our heads,” he said. The 1994 AFCON winner also praised former manager Gernot Rohr for assembling the team he inherited after the German was sacked before the AFCON began. “There is no way we will not give Gernot Rohr credit because he was the one who put this team together. He did a good job and it is quite unfortunate what happened,” he stated.
