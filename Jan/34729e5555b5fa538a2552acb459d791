Lagos, Kano and Abia States have emerged as the highest beneficiaries of the federal government’s Survival Fund, following their receipt of N2.5bn, N2bn and N1.7bn respectively. This was the highlight of a presentation made by the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mariam Katagum, at the first meeting of the Economic Sustainability Committee in 2022. The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement. In the presentation on the Survival Fund, Katagum disclosed that while all states of the Federation have received varying levels of the N75bn Survival Fund with its different schemes, eventually each state would soon receive a minimum of N1.7bn cumulative from all the schemes. She also revealed that Lagos, Abia and Kano States had crossed the bar, with Lagos reaching over N2.5bn and Kano over N2bn adding that no state has received anything less than N1bn so far. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who presided over the virtual meeting of the committee at the Presidential Villa, received reports from federal ministers and heads of agencies on the progress in the implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan of the Buhari regime. The presentations by MDAs at the meeting include the report that about 2.1 million jobs have been retained or created through the implementation of the ESP programmes. It also said approval of N10bn was given by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority to fund the deployment and local assembly of 200,000 (off-grid) Solar Homes Systems under the “Solar PowerNaija” partnership between both the NSIA and Rural Electrification Agency.
