The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami has unveiled Nigerian Postal Service Debit Card, Agency Banking platform to deepen financial inclusion and boost Nigeria’s digital economy. This came as the minister also launched 27 courier service vehicles to make NIPOST and its partner, Speedaf Express compete favourably in the industry. Pantami on Thursday at the unveiling ceremony in Abuja said it was impossible for any economy to be transformed without digitisation. The minister said a digitised economy would improve ease of doing business, improve transparency and fight corruption. He said the launched services would help NIPOST key into e-governance and a sustainable digital economy. “What we are doing today is to ensure that NIPOST is digitalized so that they will deliver on their mandate by law. “NIPOST’s Debit card, we are not agitating that it must replace our other debit cards but rather an alternative banking platform. Most importantly this service can be used online and offline. It is complementary and provides other alternatives, particularly to the people living in unobserved and underserved environments.” The PostMaster General (PMG)/CEO, NIPOST Dr Ismail Adewusi stated that the occasion marks another opportunity to reposition the agency’s services according to best global standards.
