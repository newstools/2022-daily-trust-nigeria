Philanthropist and business tycoon, Ambassador Mpakaboari LongJohn, has urged politicians to eschew bitterness and embrace peace to ensure free and fair general elections. The founder, MLJ Marine Oil and Gas, made the appeal on Sunday, urging political parties and politicians to desist from any act capable of disrupting the upcoming elections. “We need to be careful and play politics with wisdom and the right counsel from the elders. Politics is an important aspect of humanity. Through the game of politics, leaders at different levels emerge at various seasons and times.” “Politicians should oppose the politics of do-or-die. Be brothers and sisters created by God in His own image. Play politics with the mindset that one day, we will also return and reside among and interact with those we have led.” Mpaka highlighted that “many crisis and killings going on in the country could be seen as politically motivated. So, we need to be careful and play politics with wisdom and the counselling of the elders.” He also faulted the manner some politicians go about the ‘business’, noting that “some of them employ high-handedness, overbearing nature and nefarious activities in their art of politicking, actions that most times, put them at logger heads with their people. “We are encouraged to join politics so that we can contribute to leadership and development and cause a change in our society. However, politicians need to play the game according to the rule. “2023 election is not the end of life or the world. There is no need for killing, kidnapping and other evils associated with politics, to be unleashed on the electorate. “I advise them to be cautious of their actions, be mindful of their language and avoid anything that could cause crisis in their communities, local government areas and states because of the approaching 2023 general elections,” Amb. Mpaka admonished.
