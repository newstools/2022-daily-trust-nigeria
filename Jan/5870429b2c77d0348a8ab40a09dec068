The Minister of Investment, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, has called on staff of the Weights and Measures Department of the ministry to raise their effort as the department is expected to generate N1.5 trillion this year, nearly double the N805 billion it generated in 2021. The minister, who made the disclosure during the commissioning of 14 operational vehicles for the department yesterday in Abuja, also said there were plans to apply legal metrology in the telecommunications, power, banking and transport sectors to generate more revenue. Legal metrology is a form of technique that ensures accurate measurement of commodities in trade and avoids short-changing of consumers. Adebayo also said the practice would ensure accuracy and fairness to the consumers and providers of these services using the instrumentality of legal metrology. “Through such activities, the government will be able to earn additional revenue through payment of fees charged for the verification and certification of the equipment to ensure that they are fit for trade by our inspectors. Responding, the Director of the department, Hassan Ejibunu, thanked the minister for his support and promised that they would do their best to meet up with the target.
