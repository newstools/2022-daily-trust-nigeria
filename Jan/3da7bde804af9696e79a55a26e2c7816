Super Eagles forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, has revealed that it was a dream come true for him and Taiwo Awoniyi to lead the Super Eagles attack. He also said his goal celebration with the FC Union Berlin of Germany attack on Tuesday against Egypt was a recreation of a goal he scored nine years ago for the Golden Eaglets. It will also be recalled that both players played together during the U17 World Cup in UAE in 2013 but have never played together in the senior national team. “It was our celebration during the U17 World Cup, nine years ago. It’s our own way of saying thank you to the technical crew, led by coach Manu Garba. We dreamt of leading the attack for Nigeria, nine years ago and it happened. It’s a nice way to start the tournament”, Iheanacho said. The Super Eagles beat seven time champions Egypt in Garoua on Tuesday to underline their potential as one of the teams to watch out for in the competition. The victory has also pushed Nigeria to the top of Group D which also has Sudan and Guinea Bissau. Meanwhile, Awoniyi has said he is not bothered about scoring as long as the team wins. Speaking during a training session held yesterday, Awoniyi said he is in Cameroon to win and will be happy to see his team win than for him to score. “I stand to be corrected. When it comes to the matter of the national team and whether I score or not, the media should also stop it. I’m here to represent the country and it doesn’t matter who scores. “Victory is what matters. I will be happy even if I don’t score till the end of the tournament. Though it’s my job to score, if my team wins, I’m happy,” he said.
