A faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State loyal to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has said there is no plan to hold ward congresses in the State on Saturday. Mr Okelo Madukaife, the publicity secretary of Ngige’s faction, said the news of ward congresses scheduled for Saturday by the faction loyal to Senator Andy Uba as its leader was fraudulent. Okelo, in a press release made available to newsmen in Awka on Thursday, said: “This is to put our membership on notice that some mischief makers are on the prowl, confusing those who willingly submit to their misinformation. “For the avoidance of doubt, no ward congresses of APC has been scheduled for January 15, 2022, by our party. “Similarly, none was scheduled for January 08, 2022, and as contained in our last public statement, certainly none was fixed on January 03, 2022, or any other date.” He said the dates are the product of 419 people working to destabilize the chapter, with the support of people outside Anambra State for partisan interests connected to the 2023 presidential elections. According to him, those succumbing to the notice are people who have been defrauded, noting that the National Secretariat of the party has not fixed any date for congress and would not do so without necessary consultations. “Please be further reassured that only authentic congress dates will be announced by this office and shall be a reliable guide, as provided by the National Secretariat,” he said.
