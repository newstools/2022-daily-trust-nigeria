Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, former Minister of Aviation, has said Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has what it takes to defeat former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar in a presidential contest. Atiku, who lost the 2019 election to President Muhammadu Buhari, is seen as a formidable force in the political circle. While Bello, who is of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has indicated interest in the 2023 presidential race, Atiku’s body language shows that he is attempting to take another shot at the highest office in the land. Speaking in a Channels Television interview, Fani-Kayode, who dumped PDP for APC last year, rated Bello as a more formidable presidential candidate than Atiku. “I believe Governor Yahaya Bello. I believe that he will be an excellent president. I believe he will appeal to millions of young people in this country and that this is a change in the dynamics we are giving power to a younger person. That is just my view though,” he said. Asked if Bello can defeat Atiku if he clinches the APC presidential ticket,  Fani-Kayode said, “Why not? He (Bello) will defeat him (Atiku) hands down,” he said. “There are two people that will provide a very strong fight against the APC within the ranks of the PDP, only two. The first is Bala Mohammed, who I have immense respect for,” he added. “But I doubt they have the presence of mind to give him the ticket in fact they will make sure he does not get the ticket or he should come to APC and try his luck. “And Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu state who is not even on your list and he is one of the brightest and the best of them all, the most effective. They are two people that would provide a good fight. “There is nobody else on that list, particularly Atiku Abubakar, that can stand against anybody within the APC, particularly against Yahaya Bello, Fashola or Fayemi. That is just my view, and I have my reason for saying that.”
