The Etsu of Kwali, His Royal Highness (HRH) Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo (III), has expressed concern over incessant kidnapping in rural communities of his chiefdom. He appealed to the FCT Administration (FCTA) to intensify efforts to protect his subjects. Alhaji Nizazo spoke during the visit of the Secretary, Area Councils Services Secretariat (ACSS), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar Dantsoho, who was on familiarization tour to Kwali Area Council on Tuesday. “In fact, just last week, one of the councillors was kidnapped and was released after a ransom was paid, that is apart from nine other people that were kidnapped with only four released from the kidnappers’ den,” he said. He also said the incessant clashes between farmers and herders was another challenge facing his chiefdom, even as he told the secretary that his palace always waded in to resolve some complaints brought by both farmers and herders in the chiefdom. According to him, the incessant farmers/herders crises have left four people with their hands amputated in the area. The traditional ruler, therefore, appealed to the FCTA to as a matter of urgency assist in empowering hunters and vigilantes in order to check the activities of kidnappers in the area. The chairman of Kwali Area Council, Danladi Chiya, who received the mandate secretary in his office, noted with displeasure the perennial insecurity challenges bedevilling residents of the council. He told the secretary that his administration has set machinery in place to address the menace with the collaboration of Kwali chiefdoms while pledging his administration’s support and readiness work with the ACSS. On his part, the ACSS secretary, Dantsoho, said the FCTA has been doing a lot to ensure peace and rid the territory of crime. He said he will reach out to the government so that urgent measures would be taken to combat kidnapping, banditry and other crimes across the FCT.
