The 2022 edition which will be held in the next 25 days will feature a 42km race, a 10km race and a virtual race. “I congratulate the good people of Lagos State, especially the Executive Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for putting together the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, the biggest one-day sports event in Africa and one of the top ten marathons in the world in terms of prize money and participants. “Having participated in the highly competitive Okpekpe 10km Road Race on a tough terrain because it is hilly, it will be a great joy to experience the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon alongside my brother Governor Sanwo-Olu. It will be fun to run in Lagos because the course is flat”. The General Manager Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, Yussuf Alli, has urge politicians and celebrities to emulate Shaibu as he said “Being active in sports cure many illnesses and diseases.”
