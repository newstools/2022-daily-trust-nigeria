A three-year-old girl, Mutmaina, has been abducted at Aiyetoro community of Zango-Kulende Quarters in Ilorin, the kwara State capital. The father of the girl, Ahmed Azeez, said she was abducted by a lady around 4pm on Thursday. Explaining further, Azeez said, “I received a call from my wife that our daughter was nowhere to be found. I was later told that my wife went out to repair the school bag of our daughter and left her with her elder sibling, Mardiyah. “And while she was out, a woman sneaked into the house and lured them out under the pretext that she wanted to take them to a party. On their way, some people who knew the girls queried where they were going, but the lady cleverly told Mardiyah to go and call the remaining children for the said party.” He said the girl was still missing days after the incident and “we have not received any call from the lady or abductors.” On the possible identity of the lady, Azeez said the elder sister of the abducted girl, Mardiyah, who is about seven years old, said she was wearing a fez cap and was fair-complexioned. Azeez, therefore, appealed to the state government and security agencies in the state to double their effort in protecting the lives of citizens, describing the present insecurity in the state and country as absurd. Contacted, the spokesperson of the Kwara State Police Command, Ajayi Okasanmi, said the issue had not been reported.
