An aircraft belonging to the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has crashed in Bauchi State. The aircraft with registration 5N-MDA was involved in the accident, on Wednesday. There were some injuries but no fatalities, according to sources. The Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) in a statement confirmed the accident, saying it was notified by Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). The helicopter, which had six persons onboard, had departed Abuja on Wednesday evening. The statement added: “The investigating agency, AIB-N needs and hereby solicits your assistance. We want the public to know that we would be amenable to receiving any video clips, evidence, or information any member of the public may have of the accident that can assist us with this investigation. “The Bureau will appreciate that the general public and press respect the privacy of the people involved and not assume the cause of the accident until the formal report is released.” The development comes amid the concerns over weather. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) had forecasted more dust plumes around the North West and North East states capable of dropping visibility below 1000 meters, leaving flights cancellations and delays in its wake. NiMet in its weather forecast said, “thick dust haze with horizontal visibility values of less than 1000m are expected over Maiduguri, Nguru, Potiskum, Dutse, Gombe, Yola, Bauchi, Katsina, Kaduna, Zaria, Kano and Sokoto. It’s unclear if the police chopper crashed as a result of bad weather. Editor’s note: This picture was used for illustration
