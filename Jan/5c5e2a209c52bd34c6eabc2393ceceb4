President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family, the government and people of Oyo State over the death of the former governor of the state, Otunba Christopher Alao-Akala. Alao-Akala died on Wednesday at the age of 71. The president, in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the former police officer served the country and the people of the state with dedication by making very important contributions to the development of institutions and communities. Buhari expressed hope that the family, friends and associates of the late governor would honour his vision of entrenching good governance in the country and passion to lift the downtrodden in the society. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in a press release by his media office said the death of the former governor came as a ‘rude shock.’ He described him as a prolific politician whose records of achievement as governor remained enviable. The governor of the state, Seyi Makinde, yesterday abruptly ended the 2022 Inter-faith Prayer Service organised by the Oyo State Civil Service, following the receipt of the news of the death. Makinde, who called for a minute silence for the former governor, prayed to God to repose to his soul. Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said his death had opened a deep sore in the hearts of the people of the state and Nigerians, who looked up to him as a rallying point and a political stabiliser. “He was more than a politician, a man of many parts, whose managerial skills and experience are required at this critical period in our national life, especially in our party, APC ahead of the 2023 general elections,” he said.
