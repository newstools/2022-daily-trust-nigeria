Eighteen political parties in the country have fielded candidates for various offices ahead of the February 5, 2022 local government election in Kebbi State. The Commissioner for Publicity and Voter Education, Kebbi State Independent Electoral Commission (KESIEC), Mustapha Usman Ka’oje, made this known yesterday in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. Ka’oje assured that the electoral body would conduct free, fair and credible council poll. He said: “18 political parties have indicated interest to participate in the forthcoming local government council poll as they have all fielded candidates. Though, some of the political parties were not able to field candidates for all the positions. “As a commission, we cannot begin to entertain faction. If we do that it is capable of truncating the electoral processes. “As far as we are concerned, we have only one APC in the state that is the one that has been attending our meetings,” he said.
