 In a seeming division within the rank and file of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) over the 2023 presidency, the group has warned those rooting for some presidential hopefuls to stop using its name for their “petty political mileage.” This followed a recent meeting where 57 civil society groups using the Oodua nomenclature mobilized the South West to support the presidential ambitions of three of their kinsmen. Those endorsed by the mega accord were Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State. But OPC, through its publicity secretary, Barr Yinka Oguntimehin, said the congress is not part of the mega accord where the three aspirants were endorsed.
