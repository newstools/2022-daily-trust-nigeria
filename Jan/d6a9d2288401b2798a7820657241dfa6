A housewife, Basirat Ajayi, has narrated to a Grade A Customary Court at Mapo in Ibadan how her husband, Ajayi Babatunde, usually gives her and their three children N200 to N500 as daily feeding allowance. Basirat, who is a trader, said her husband was a smoker and a drinker who normally returned home in the dead of night. She said her mother-in-law usually fought her, adding that her husband’s entire family was troublesome. Basirat said: “It is true that my marriage to Babatunde was an arrangement between my parents and his. “So, they did not pay bride price on me. “Furthermore, he does not respect my relatives and he is not responsible to the children. “Believe me, Babatunde usually gives the three children only N500 or N200 as feeding allowance. “In fact, he has since stopped giving them when I took them away. “Babatunde will not take care of the children properly because he gives them to his mother who doesn’t cater for them,” Basirat said. Ajayi Babatunde, an electrician who had earlier sought divorce from his estranged wife on the ground of “her constant repulsiveness and nagging” said he could no longer cope with his wife’s hatred for him and his relatives. “My lord, Basirat was betrothed to me because my marriage to her was basically an arrangement between my parents and Basirat’s parents. “I did not partake in the whole marital episode that led to her movement into my home. “I don’t know why she so detests my family members because she doesn’t want to see them and I’m tired of our togetherness. “I want the court to grant me custody of the three children,” Babatunde said. The president of the court, Mrs S. M. Akintayo, advised the couple to maintain peace pending when the court decided on the case. She adjourned the suit until March 3 for judgment.
