The Benue State Government has commenced the demolition of illegal residential buildings in Makurdi, the state capital. Our correspondent reports that about 1,000 of the affected buildings are located at Veterinary Quarters in North Bank, a suburb of Makurdi. The General Manager (GM) of Benue State Urban Development Authority, Apostle Abraham Gbilekaa, said the structures were marked for demolition because they encroached on government land without Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) and building approval.
