Kidnappers yesterday shot dead two vigilantes and kidnapped four farmers at Rafindaji village, Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This incident is coming barely 24 hours after gunmen abducted three farmers that were conveying yams from Paikon-Bassa in Abaji Area Council to Lambata market in Niger State. A resident of Rafindaji community, Dauda Ishaku, said the kidnappers who carried weapons emerged from the bush and abducted the people on Monday afternoon. He said the victims were harvesting yams on their farms when the kidnappers rounded them up and whisked them away at gunpoint. Ishaku, who is a farmer in the community, gave the names of the deceased vigilantes as Shuaibu Musa and Garba Aliyu. According to him, vigilantes who got wind of abduction of the farmers went after the gunmen but while exchanging  gunfire  one vigilante was shot dead. “The kidnappers escaped with the four farmers on Monday and in the early hours of Tuesday came back to the community and killed another vigilante,” he said. The district head of Gurdi Chiefdom, Alhaji Bala Mohammed, confirmed the latest abduction of four farmers and killing of two vigilantes at Rafindaji community under his chiefdom. “In fact, it was just this morning when report came from Rafindaji community that four other farmers that were harvesting yams were kidnapped on Monday afternoon while two vigilantes lost their lives during an encounter with the gunmen,” he said. The spokesman of the Niger State Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, was yet to pick calls or reply a text message sent to him about the latest abduction.
