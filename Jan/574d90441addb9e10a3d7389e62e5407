A woman, Fatima Sanusi, who is standing trial for defrauding her fiancé of N10 million 10 days to their wedding, has through her counsel, Barrister Bala Adamu, filed a preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the court on the matter. The mother of two was arraigned before a magistrates’ court in Barnawa, Kaduna State, for defrauding her fiancé, Umar Oruma, and declared she was no longer interested in the consummation of the marriage 10 days to the wedding, and reportedly got married to the father of her children instead. At the resumed hearing yesterday in Kaduna, Barr Adamu filed the preliminary objection to the counsel to the plaintiff, Abdulbasit Suleiman. However, Barr Suleiman said he had five witnesses in court, but noted that, “We were served with a notice of preliminary objection at 9.55am on Wednesday, and in view of this, we acknowledge a short date for hearing of the preliminary objection.” The Magistrate, Aliyu Dogara, adjourned the case to February 1, 2022.
