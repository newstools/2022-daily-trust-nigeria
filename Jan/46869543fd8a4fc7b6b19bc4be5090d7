Residents of Unguwar Dosa in Kaduna North Local Government Area have rejected the installation of telecommunication mast in their community. According to them, the decision was because they were afraid it posed a health risk to those living nearby. A community leader, Alhaji Bello Kagara, who spoke during a meeting with the Kaduna North Local Government Area Chairman Muktar Boloni, called on the chairman to direct the owners to remove the mast. He complained that some members of the community, among them the elderly and children, find it difficult to sleep due to the sound of the generator powering the telecoms mast. He added the installation was wrong because it was done in the middle of residential houses. “We called this meeting to let the chairman know that as residents, we are not safe with this telecommunications mast sited within our houses and all effort to have it removed have failed. So, we need your help,” he said. In his remarks, the chairman, Muktar Boloni, advised the leaders of the community to forward their complaint letter to Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency (KASUPDA) and the Ministry of Health and copy the LGC. He promised to follow up on their complaint to ensure justice is done to all parties and he urged them to embrace peace in the community.
