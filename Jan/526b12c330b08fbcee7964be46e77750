Three farmers that were kidnapped at Paikon-Bassa community of Gurdi Ward in Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have regained freedom after payment of N5 million to their abductors. Daily Trust had reported that the farmers, Maikusawa Usman, Hussaini Danjuma and Sheneni Yakubu, were kidnapped while conveying yam in a van from Paikon Bassa to Lambata market in Niger State on Sunday, January, 16. The Village Head of Gurdi, Abubakar Sardauna, who confirmed the release of the victims, said they were released on Sunday around 6pm at Mayaki, a border community in Niger State. He said the family members of the victims sourced part of the N5m after selling their farm produce, adding that they borrowed some amount to complete the N5m. He further said five other farmers that were abducted two weeks ago on their farms at Rafindaji village were still in captivity, and therefore appealed to security forces to rescue them. The spokesman of the Niger State Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, was yet to pick calls at the time of filing this report.
