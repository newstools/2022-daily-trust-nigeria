 The literary society in Kano has launched an anthology of poems written in Engausa (a combination of Hausa and English languages), titled ‘Kwaraption’ as part of its effort to highlight the fight against corruption. The anthology was birthed from the literary works of talented poets who fused the English and Hausa languages in an eclectic combination with a view to creating awareness on the nature, causes and dangers of corruption, as well as ways to curb it. The Coordinator of the event, Khalid Imam opened the floor for poets to recite some poetic pieces thereby encouraging the recitation of ENGAUSA poems. The guest speaker at the event, Professor Abdalla Uba Adamu, said he explored the ambivalent meaning of corruption in different societies, including the Hausa culture pointing out that “many behaviours which our people have come to accept are actually forms of corruption. “The prevalence of these behaviours had led to a number of sayings such as the popular “Albishirin ka…Goro”, where one who brings good tidings to someone expects to be given a token in return. “Other entrenched traditions have led to the normalisation of corrupt practices such as kickbacks, which is synonymous with the practice commonly referred to as’’tukwici “. On the concept of Engausa, the professor noted that many people have a biased way of embracing languages, and though many people might view Engausa as a corrupt way of expression stemming from the inability to express fluidly in English, it has actually been around for some time, especially in artistic works and everyday communication. The book, edited by Dr Murtala Uba Adamu and published in 2020, consists of 72 pages containing 51 poems by 45 poets. About fifty per cent of poems (48%) contained in the book were written by female poets, which indicated an improvement in the participation of females in the literary arts.
