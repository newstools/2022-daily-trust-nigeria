In a commitment to ensuring a safer and hygienic FCT for all residents, the six area councils are currently undergoing a massive clean-up exercise embarked upon by the Satellite Town Development Department (STDD) of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). A statement from the PRO,STDD, Meeme Felicia, said that the Coordinator of STDD, Comrade Obinna Francis Ogwuegbu, who inspected the exercise at the weekend, said the exercise involves desilting of drains, dump sites and evacuating waste around the interchanges and roads leading into and out of the satellite towns of Gwagalada, Kwali, Kubwa, Kuje, Abaji, and Karshi. The STDD coordinator said the exercise would be an ongoing one and appealed to residents, particularly those living in the suburbs to desist from dumping refuse on drainage and by the roadsides. Comrade Obinna Francis Ogwuegbu added that the exercise is part of STDD’s mandate to keep the satellite towns around the FCT clean and said the six area councils contractors on waste management have all resumed work at their various sites. The STDD coordinator lamented that it is the duty of the area councils chairmen to clean and  manage wastes in all the satellite towns, since they are being paid to do it. The department of satellite towns is only meant to do intervention when necessary but that is not happening. The coordinator who inspected the exercise assured that the Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello-led FCT administration with the Minister of State for FCT, Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, remains committed to ensuring a safer and hygienic FCT for all residents.
