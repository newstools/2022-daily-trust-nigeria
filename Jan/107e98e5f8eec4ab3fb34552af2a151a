Senator Babafemi Ojudu, the Special Adviser on Political Matters to President Muhammadu Buhari, has welcomed a former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, to the All Progressives Congress, APC. There is a rumour on social media that Kwankwaso was planning to move to the ruling party. Ojudu, who was also uncertain about the rumour, made the statement on his Facebook page, describing him (Kwankwaso) as; “a great mobilizer and thoroughbred politician.” He extended his welcome to the former governor pending the confirmation of the defection report. “The news is everywhere that the leader of the Kwakwansiya Movement, His Excellency, Senator Rabiu Kwakwanso, has returned to our party APC. I have not confirmed this yet but if true he is most welcomed. “This will also be the best move of his political career. A great mobilizer, brilliant organiser, and thoroughbred politician, Kwankwaso is the leader of the red cap-wearing multitude. He will be a big addition to our movement for a greater Nigeria,” the post reads.  However, Daily Trust reached out to the Coordinator of the Kwankwasiyya’s media centre, Sunusi Bature Dawakin Tofa, who said the rumour is baseless and not true. “It is not true,” he said, adding that, “there’s nothing like that for now.” “If you pick The Punch newspaper of today, Kwankwaso has spoken extensively two pages in an exclusive interview and there’s no where he mentioned or hinted anything like that,” he said. There has been speculation that Kwankwaso, who has been at loggerhead with Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, will join the APC to team up with another opponent of the governor, a former governor of Kano State, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, to create a stronger force to neutralise the Ganduje’s camp.
