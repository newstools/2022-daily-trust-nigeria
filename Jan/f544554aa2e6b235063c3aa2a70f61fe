 Gunmen have beheaded a 65-year-old man in Ubudom Atta in the Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State. After beheading the man identified as Nnoruoka Onyeokwu, his head was displayed at the primary school in the community. Our correspondent gathered that the victim was attacked in his house at the night and the villagers woke up the next day to see his severed head dangling on a tree at the premises of the school. The Public Relations Officer of the police in the state, Mike Abattam, could not be reached for comment. The incident is coming after the traditional ruler of the community, Edwin Azike, was on December 8 abducted and his corpse dumped at the market square the next day. This was after some gunmen had also attacked and burnt a police division headquarters, magistrate’s court and a health centre in the community in June.
