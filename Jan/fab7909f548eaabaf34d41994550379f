The suspended acting national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ntufam Hilliard Eta, has expressed interest in the governorship of Cross River State come 2023. He spoke with newsmen yesterday in Calabar, the state capital, insisting that what the people of the state required was a man with maximum courage and determination to revamp and reposition the state. Eta was expelled from the APC in 2020 for allegedly refusing to withdraw a case he filed against the party, but he has insisted that he remained a member of the APC, arguing that due process was not followed in expelling him as national officer of the party. He said he has studied the polity of the state deeply and resolved that he would step in to rescue the situation, so that it does not further degenerate.
