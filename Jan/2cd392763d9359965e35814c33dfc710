Players of Kano Pillars football club have been promised their outstanding match bonuses, if they will beat visiting MFM of Lagos. This pledge was made yesterday by the chairman of the club, Alhaji Surajo Shaaibu Yahaya, when he addressed the players and technical crew yesterday at the Ahmadu Bello stadium. The former NPFL champions are billed to host another embattled side, MFM in week 8 of the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League. He said “I want you to win tomorrow (today) and you will get your outstanding match bonuses instantly. You will be paid including the match you won against Niger Tornadoes in week 6. If you win, you will be paid all your outstanding match bonuses.” Speaking on the unsatisfactory performance of Kano Pillars who suffered a 0-1 loss at Kwara United on Thursday, Jambul said the government and people of Kano state are not happy with the present situation in the club. He charged the players to put their heads together and come up with an immediate solution to the dwindling fortunes of the team. While commending the government for the unwavering support to Kano Pillars, the Chairman expressed confidence in the ability of the players to turn around the bad situation. Responding, the Chief Coach, Musa Ibrahim, assured that they will do everything humanly possible to beat MFM. Pillars presently occupy 15th position with seven points from a possible 21 points after managing two wins, one draw and four losses out of seven matches played so far.
