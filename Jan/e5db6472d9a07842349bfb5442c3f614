The International Visitor Leadership Programme (IVLP) Alumni Association of the United States has urged residents of the FCT, especially the youth, to shun apathy in the February 12 FCT area council elections. The organisation gave the advice at the weekend in Abuja in Damagaza village, Lokogoma District, at a youth and leadership enlightenment programme in commemoration of the 2022 Martin Luther King Jnr (MLK) Day, with the theme ‘Leadership is personal; it Starts with Me’. President of the association, Raheemat Momodu, said the objective of the programme was to expose participants to the tenets of tolerance, dialogue, peaceful coexistence and the values of employing peaceful means to engender political change and resolution of divergent or opposing views. The guest speaker and a former editor of the Guardian on Sunday, Ambassador Fred Ohwahwa, urged Nigerians to emulate the virtues of the late civil rights advocate, Martin Luther King, in promoting peace and unity in our political system. In his remarks, the Chief of Damagaza community, James Budebo, commended the alumni for organising the event and urged all Nigerians to take responsibility for the affairs of the country.
