As some week seven matches in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League get underway this afternoon across match venues, MFM of Lagos and Abia Warriors will be aiming to end the unbeaten run of table topping Remo Stars and Rivers United. While Rivers United who are second on the table with 12 points are guests of MFM in Lagos, leaders Remo Stars who are topping the table with 14 points will play host to Abia Warriors in a contest that is expected to produce fireworks. Rivers United and Remo Stars who won 2-1 away at Wikki Tourists last Sunday are the two clubs that are yet to taste defeat in the 2021/2022 NPFL season. Niger Tornadoes also will be aiming to bounce back to winning ways as they host 3SC who were forced to a 2-2 draw at home by Sunshine Stars last week. Buoyed by the point they picked at 3SC, Sunshine Stars welcome Gombe United who drew 0-0 with Enyimba at the Pantami stadium, crisis-ridden Heartland host ‘oriental brothers’ Rangers who defeated MFM 2-0 in Nnewi while Nasarawa United 2-1 winners over 10-man Lobi Stars last Sunday will make a short trip to Jos where they have a date with Plateau United in a potentially explosive encounter north central derby. On their part, Dakkada who suffered a crushing 5-0 loss in the hands of Plateau United in Jos will be hoping to bounce back when they entertain Wikki Tourists at the Godswill Akpabio International stadium Uyo just as Katsina United will battle Lobi Stars at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium without their fans who have been banned by the LMC over unruly behaviour. Meanwhile, two mouth-watering fixtures will be held tomorrow as Enyimba and reigning champions Akwa United slug it out at the Aba Township stadium while Kwara United try to pull down Kano Pillars at the Ilorin Township stadium.
