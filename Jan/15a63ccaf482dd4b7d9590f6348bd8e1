Augustine Eguavoen, Coach of the Super Eagles of Nigeria, has assured President Muhammadu Buhari that the team will not let the nation down. He gave the assurance when Buhari reached out to the players and technical crew in Cameroon on Sunday morning. The president had expressed satisfaction with the Nigerian team, charging them to keep flying. Responding, Eguavoen said, “We are so excited that His Excellency, President Buhari, has come to speak with us this morning. On behalf of the players and the technical crew, I want to say thank you very much sir. “The group stage has passed, and your speaking to us is a morale booster. Thank you for your support, Mr President, we also thank the Hon. Minister, and the NFF President. We are so privileged, and want to promise that you should just relax, we’ll come out victorious. We won’t let the nation down.” General Abayomi Olonisakin (rtd), Nigeria’s Ambassador to Cameroon, said the over 4 million Nigerians living in Cameroon have been giving robust support to the Super Eagles since they arrived Garoua, Cameroon, on January 5, “and they will continue to do so.” Ahmed Musa, on behalf of the players, appreciated Mr President, noting that it is not easy to speak with the leader of a country, and they count themselves privileged. “We will make Nigeria proud, now that we have the blessings of the father of the nation,” Musa said. NFF President, Asaju Pinnick described the video conference as “a priceless privilege,” and thanked Buhari and the nation at large for their prayers and support. He said under the current dispensation, Nigeria has won the Under 17 football tournament twice, “and we want to win the African Cup of Nations too.”
