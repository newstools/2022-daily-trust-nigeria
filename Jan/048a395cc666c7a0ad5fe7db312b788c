Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, Friday submitted the report of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ekiti State governorship primary to the party’s headquarters in Abuja. The governor chaired the seven-member committee that conducted the direct primary on Thursday in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The APC Director of Organisation, Prof. Ussiju Medaner, received the report on behalf of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. Briefing newsmen after submitting the report, Badaru said elections were successfully held in 166 wards. “11 wards were disrupted and we cancelled those areas. But in 166 wards, people actively participated. And I think you all have the videos of what transpired in all the 166 wards except the 11 wards.” Biodun Abayomi had emerged as the governorship candidate of the party amidst protest. Seven aspirants had earlier on Thursday announced their decision to boycott the exercise over an alleged plot to manipulate the process.
