The leader of pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has said the former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has the right to contest the 2023 presidential election. On Tuesday, the former governor of Lagos met President Muhammadu Buhari to inform him of his intention to run for the 2023 presidency. However, Adebanjo stressed that the group will not queue behind any candidate until the restructuring of the country, saying the present constitution must be changed before the 2023 election. He said,  “Your man has every right to contest the election, he is not disabled, so what is the big deal about that? “We are not contending who is the President now because we don’t believe in the constitution that we have. Until that constitution is changed, then we will talk on where the President will be. “We have no candidate now until that constitution is changed because I don’t want to go on uncharted sea that is the implication now. “You must believe in the constitution before you say I want to be a part of it. I am not going to be part of the constitution or election that operates a military constitution. That’s the bone of contention and which President Buhari himself has not disputed. The constitution we have is a military one.”
