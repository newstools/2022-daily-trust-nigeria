Expert explains implications An economist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf said the surge in demand during the December festivities must have played a role in the marginal spike and reversal of the deceleration trend in headline inflation. Yusuf explained that inflationary pressures remain a significant macroeconomic risk in the Nigerian economy.  “It is a major concern to both businesses and the citizens.” He listed the implication to include the escalation of production and operating costs for businesses, leading to erosion of profit margins, drop in sales, the decline in turnover and weak manufacturing capacity utilisation. He said high food prices impact adversely on citizens’ welfare and aggravate poverty adding that weak purchasing power will pose a significant risk to business sustainability. Major drivers of inflation and cost in the economy The analyst identified a surge in consumer spending driven by the December festivities. Exchange rate depreciation. Liquidity challenges in the foreign exchange market impact adversely on manufacturing output. Security concerns affecting agricultural output. He also identified climate change effects on agricultural production, adding that there are increasing cases of flooding and desertification in many parts of the country that have had a negative impact on agricultural output. Yusuf also pointed at structural constraints affecting productivity in the agricultural value chain; High transportation costs affecting distribution costs across the country. This is also reflected in the huge differential between farm gate prices and market prices. He said: “Monetisation of fiscal deficit [CBN financing of deficit] is highly inflationary because of the liquidity injection effects on the economy. This becomes worrisome when statutory thresholds are exceeded. “High transactions cost at the nation’s ports increases the production and operating costs of businesses. High energy cost. High import duty on intermediate goods and raw materials.” Recommendation to tame inflation To tame the current inflationary pressure, the analyst explained that government needs to fix the following: Reform the foreign exchange market to stabilise the exchange rate and reduce volatility. Address forex liquidity issues through appropriate policy measures. They also urged the government to address the security concerns causing disruption to agricultural activities. Address productivity issues in the real sector of the economy and address the challenge of high transportation costs. Reduce fiscal deficit financing by the CBN to minimise the incidence of high-powered money in the economy. Manage climate change consequences to reduce flooding and desertification. He also called for the restoration of normalcy and good order at the nation’s ports to reduce transaction costs. Reduce import duty on intermediate products and raw materials for industries to reduce production costs, especially in the light of the sharp depreciation in the exchange rate.
