. The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero has emphasised the need for all hands to be on deck towards impacting proper health care service delivery, especially in the state’s semi-urban areas. He made the call at a community mobilisation outreach held at Panisau, Ungogo Local Government Area, organised by the state government in collaboration with Kano Emirate’s committee on health as well as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The event also featured maternal and child health, routine immunisation intensification, COVID-19 vaccination enhancement and zero dose implementation in five local government areas of the state. The emir lamented how the community faced challenges especially in terms of polio vaccines, malnutrition and maternal mortality. He reaffirmed that the Emirate would not relent in its effort to protect the lives of the teeming population. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa, said the rationale behind the outreach was to bring rural dwellers closer and access to basic health programmes so as to enable them to enjoy more dividends of democracy.
