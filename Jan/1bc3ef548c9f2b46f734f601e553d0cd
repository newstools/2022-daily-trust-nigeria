Super Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has expressed his concerns over the poor conversion rate of the Super Eagles in the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Speaking during yesterday’s press conference, the former Super Eagles defender said he has worked on the team’s deficiency and hopes to see it work out on the pitch. He said after using the same starting eleven for the games against Egypt and Sudan, there will be changes to the lineup in today’s last group match against Guinea Bissau. Eguavoen added that despite victories over Egypt and Sudan which qualified the team for the Round of 16, there will not be complacent in their last group game. “We will not take our foot off the pedal. We will respect our opponents. We will have the same enthusiasm. It is not expected that the game will be smooth for 90 minutes. Our major concern is conversion. We have worked on that and we hope to see improvements. “It is always good to qualify. We have done that with style. Expect few changes tomorrow. Everyone has come to play. We will make one or two changes. “There is always pressure. Finishing with nine points will be very good. We did that in 2006. With the group that we have, we are ready to do that,” he stated.
