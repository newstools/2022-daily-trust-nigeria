The Coalition for Tourism Development has called for improved security in hotels and tourism sites across the country. Mr Abdullahi Aremu made the call on Wednesday in an interview with NAN in Abuja. He said the protection of tourism and hospitality assets became necessary as it would also assist in providing the enabling environment for the industry’s actors to contribute their quota to the nation’s economic development. “There is a need for improved security in the tourism and hospitality industry, especially in the area of security challenges,” he said.
