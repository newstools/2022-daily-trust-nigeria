Some stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have rejected the proposed February 26th date for the party’s convention. The group, under the auspices of APC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum, said the ruling party could potentially disintegrate should it proceed with the convention. The APC stakeholders made their position known in a press conference on Thursday in Abuja. According to the Secretary-General, Hon Tobias Ogbeh, some party faithful have been working with foreign agents to destabilize the party at the convention. He noted that the plan is to run a parallel secretariat and institute legal cases against the party to ensure that it doesn’t produce any candidate in 2023. Ogbeh added that if not properly managed, this could ultimately lead to the mass exodus of party members over unresolved and lingering legal issues. The APC stakeholders, therefore, urged the party leadership to announce another date for the convention to save it from being hijacked by some vested interest that does not wish the party well. If this is done, they, however, assured that the APC will remain united and all those scheming to undermine the party would be put to shame.
