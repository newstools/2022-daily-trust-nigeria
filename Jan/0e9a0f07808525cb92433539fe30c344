Hon. Barr. Orji Uchenna Orji, Commissioner for Information and State Orientation in Ebonyi State, has said some persons are trying to demonise Governor David Umahi. He said this in a statement issued on Saturday. “The attention of Ebonyi State Ministry of Information and State Orientation has been drawn to a vicious and malicious publication authored by a group of hireling of clannish prejudices, who have been on a dedicated mission to demonize the reputation of the Divine Mandate administration of the Governor of Ebonyi State, His Excellency Engr. David Nweze Umahi FNATE, FNATE (Akubaraoha). “This group, which has been declared wanted by security agencies for fanning embers of disunity and violence in the troubled Effium/Ezza Effium community, has as usual dished out falsehood and fake news about the state of things in Ebonyi state in an attempt to lower the pleasure that overwhelmed the feelings of the people over the Presidential declaration of our dear Governor who has made a captivating mark in the transformation of Ebonyi State and the prosperity of its inhabitants. “While we do not intend to join issues with these agents of falsehood powered by frustrated opposition elements, we urge members of the public, especially the media operators to disregard and discountenance as baseless at all material times, any post(s) credited to them and all their agents including those publishing this sponsored fake news. “Lets those defiants know that they are on a failed journey as their attack on our cherished Governor’s solid and formidable reputation including their sponsorship of filthy social media posts to lower the image of the State would rather earn them social ostracism as the public and indeed Nigerian citizens are standing overwhelmingly with the Governor who has performed supremely in changing the ugly narratives of our hitherto neglected people.
