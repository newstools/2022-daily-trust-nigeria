A coalition of Civil Society Partners on Electoral Reform has cautioned the National Assembly against postponing the January 18 resumption date, warning it could jeopardise the passage of the amended Electoral Bill. The coalition said this on Tuesday in Abuja in a statement jointly signed by the Executive Director, Adopt a Goal Initiative, Ariyo-Dare Atoye; convener, Raising New Voices Initiative, Jude Feranmi; and human rights advocate, Rachel Anyanwu. They urged the leadership of the National Assembly to rectify all errors that may cause issues in the interpretation and execution of the law by government agencies. They also urged the lawmakers to suspend the House and Senate rules and bureaucracy of legislative business, and deal with the bill within 48 hours of their resumption.
