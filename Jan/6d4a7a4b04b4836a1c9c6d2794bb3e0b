The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN) is partnering with Google DigitalSkill alongside MindtheGap in training 3,700 Nigerian youths on digital skills. The training, which will be carried out mainly for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is expected to begin across the six geo-political zones on Tuesday, January 18th. This is contained in a statement by the Information and Communications Department of SMEDAN. The statement added that the training was initiated and sponsored by Google International to train 1 million youths in Africa. SMEDAN, a body that regulates Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the country, will be concerned with the training of the selected MSMEs in Nigeria. The training will be the third in a series of collaborations between Google International and SMEDAN in the area of digital business skills for business owners. This year, SMEDAN will expand the number of beneficiaries from 25 to 100 each that will be drawn from the Federation, including the Federal Capital Territory. The major consultant that will facilitate the training is MindtheGap, while SMEDAN will also introduce their business module to entrepreneurs in the course of the training. The major target of the training is for MSMEs to move their businesses online seamlessly without paying a kobo, as the world gradually revolutionises to digital technology. After the training, participants will get their business addresses on Google Map and other Google Search engines so that meeting prospective buyers and clients will be less stressful.
