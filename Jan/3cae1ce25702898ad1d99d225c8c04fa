Embattled Super Cop, Abba Kyari, has posted fresh wedding pictures on his verified Facebook page. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), who was among the dignitaries at the wedding Fatiha of Maina Alkali, son of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), in Maiduguri, Borno State capital, on Saturday, had posted over 400 pictures of the event, including the ones with socialite Obi Cubana. This had triggered a backlash as Obi Cubana and Kyari are in the eye of the storm. While Kyari was suspended from the force after an indictment by the FBI over his alleged relationship with Abbas Ramoni, billionaire fraudster, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) detained Obi Cubana for days over alleged money laundering. He was subsequently picked up by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) over alleged ties to drug barons in Asia. But at the wedding Fatiha of the IGP’s son, Obi Cubana and Kyari exchanged banters. Many, particularly on social media, had demanded an update on the panel set up to probe Kyari after FBI’s indictment. The comments kept on pouring, but amid the storm, the Super Cop posted fresh pictures and said he could not describe the love his people have for him. “Also Attended Several other weddings in my home town Maiduguri Yesterday. Can’t describe the Genuine Love and Affection from our people. It’s overwhelming and beyond words. We Give Glory to GOD Almighty,” he wrote. Below are some of the new pictures.
