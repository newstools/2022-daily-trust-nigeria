Following a successful listing on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX – formerly the Nigerian Stock Exchange), Ronchess Global Resources Plc (RONCHESS) notified the Nigerian Exchange on the restructuring of its board. Ronchess Board of Directors is now led by Mr. Adeolu Adeboye – a graduate of Software Engineering from the University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. He practiced in this field for 10 years in the United Kingdom before moving back to Nigeria. The board is co-chaired by the eminently qualified flight Captain Niyi Ogunnowo with over 2 decades of experience spanning Information Technology and the transportation industry across Nigeria and the United States of America. Ronchess Executive Management is ably led by Mr. Jackson Ukuevo, an Harvard trained professional from the Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Boston Massachusetts United States of America. From Road Marking, Ronchess has morphed into a construction giant under Jackson’s leadership, with ongoing plans to transform into an Infrastructure Management firm with interest in Road, Rail, Airport and Waste Management services in Nigeria.
