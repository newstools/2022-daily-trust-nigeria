The Nationalists Movement (TNM) has urged former President Goodluck Jonathan, to contest the 2023 presidential election, in the interest of national development. The national coordinator of the movement, Abidde O. Robinson, made the call Thursday in Abuja at a news conference. Robison said Nigerians needed a popular leader like Jonathan with a track record of integrity and statesmanship to bridge the North-South divide for a national alliance in 2023. “Nigeria is on the march again. As the count down to 2023 presidential elections begins, all patriotic Nigerians must deeply reflect on this adage that says, ‘when a child falls, he looks front but when an adult falls, he looks back to see what caused his fall’. He said that there was no doubt that Nigerians wanted Jonathan and would overwhelmingly vote for him and his party of choice. “We are, therefore, passionately pleading with Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to yield and not resist the wishes and calls of the majority of patriotic Nigerians from home and in the diaspora to come back to Aso Rock Presidential Villa in 2023.”
