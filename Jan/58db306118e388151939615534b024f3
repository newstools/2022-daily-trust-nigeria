Senator Shehu Sani has said he would contest the Kaduna State governorship in the 2023 general elections to clean the alleged mess done by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Sani, who represented Kaduna North Senatorial Zone at the National Assembly from 2015 -2019, made his intention to vie for the governorship seat in an interview aired on Invicta FM and monitored in the state. He said there was the need to dislodge the APC-led government in the state for another government to come in and deliver true dividend of democracy to the people. Senator Sani advised the top echelon of his party, PDP, to unite its members to ensure that they form the next government that would respect the will of the poor in the state.
