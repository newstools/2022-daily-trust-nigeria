Dele Momodu, Publisher and Newspaper columnist, on Thursday, declared interest to participate in the presidential race in 2023 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He made the declaration at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja after formally presenting his letter of intent to vie for the presidential ticket to the National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu. Momodu said the action was taken because he could not become the president unless his political party first nominates him. Ayu, in his remarks, promised to provide a level-playing field for all aspirants, adding that the party has no preferred candidate. The PDP boss, who said the aspirant had brought his political and media experience to the party, urged him to seek the support of the party members. He said the party would support him if he emerges as its candidate and will expect all other aspirants to team up with whoever becomes the standard-bearer of the party.
