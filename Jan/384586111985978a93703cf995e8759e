No fewer than 30 youth-based Non-Governmental Organisations in the North have on Sunday met in Kano to appeal to Dr Ibrahim Abubakar Lajada, a US-based businessman, to run for Nigeria’s President in 2023. The groups, under the umbrella of Lajada Support Group, said with the presidential assent to Not TooYoung To Run Bill into law in 2018, their candidate has what it takes to rescue the country from what they described as failed leadership. According to the Chairman of the group, Salisu Idris Abdullahi, they were impressed by Lajada’s antecedents, hence their call on him to run for the position. He said, “Though our candidate is based in the United States, as a successful businessman, he has always had Nigeria’s interest at heart. “He has contributed a lot in empowering many youths in the country, secured admission for many, settled hospital bills for less privileged as well as supported many IDPs.” Abdullahi also said the Borno State indigene, Lajada, will help Nigeria actualise the dream of having a youth as President. Similarly, the Secretary-General of the group, Mustapha M. Basheer, said it was time for youths to stand up and fight for themselves, as there was no better time than now. “If politics is all about the number, we the youths have it and are ready to take what rightly belongs to us and we believe Lajada has the quality of shouldering this responsibility,” Basheer added. Daily Trust reported that the youths, who were drawn from 19 northern states, said the country cannot afford to repeat its previous mistake of electing old people to lead her.
