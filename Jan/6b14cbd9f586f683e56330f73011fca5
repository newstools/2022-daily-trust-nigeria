The Nigeria Football Federation reveals no target has been set for Nigeria’s interim coach Augustine Eguavoen at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Eguavoen – who represented the Super Eagles for 11 years – was named interim manager of the West Africans in December following the sacking of Gernot Rohr after five years. He will be replaced by Portuguese tactician Jose Peseiro after the 33rd edition of the biennial African football showpiece in Cameroon. In the wake of the 56-year-old’s fine start at AFCON 2021, GOAL asked the NFF Director of Communications Ademola Olajire if the country’s football ruling body has set a target for Eguavoen, he said: “He is on an interim basis, he has just been handed the mandate to do his very best, and we know what his very best is. “Sixteen years ago, he led the team to a bronze medal in Egypt and of course, he is the coach with the highest percentage of wins in matches for Nigeria – 12 wins in 14 games over three stints is not something to sneeze at. “So, we [NFF] believe that we will go all the way to lead the team to the final.” Despite doubts about Nigeria’s ability to defeat Egypt in their opening match, the team subdued the North Africans 1-0 with Kelechi Iheanacho’s 30th-minute strike settling the encounter staged in Garoua. On Saturday, January 15, the 2013 African champions subdued the Falcons of Jediane 3-1 to book a place in the knockout phase.
