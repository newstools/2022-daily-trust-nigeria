A former governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, yesterday asked leaders and top monarchs in the South West to consult, consider and streamline the number of politicians vying for the presidential seat, from the region ahead of the 2023 general elections. His position was backed by a former minister of Defence (State), Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, the Deputy Minority Whip at the House of Representatives, Hon. Segun Adekoya and a three-time governorship candidate in the state, Gboyega Nasiru Isiaka (GNI). They spoke with newsmen at the Abraham Tabernacle Baptist International Worship Centre in Sagamu, on Sunday, during the 17th annual thanksgiving and 10th year remembrance service for late Most Reverend Abraham Adebola Daniel, father of the former governor. Addressing the gathering of political, religious and traditional leaders, the former governor noted that there was the need for major stakeholders in the South West to embark on consultations to prune and present a consensus candidate from the pool of politicians running for the presidency. He said, “The western states or what you can call the South West is being strongly considered to take over the mantle of leadership for the presidency. “I appeal to all our obas and leaders not to rest on their oars. Power is never served a la carte, they therefore have duties and responsibilities to come together and say we can present a candidate.”
