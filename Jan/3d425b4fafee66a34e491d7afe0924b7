Sammie Okposo Deletes Verified Twitter, Instagram Accounts Actress Iyabo Ojo shares rough experience as single mum The Disk Jockey recently cut her hair and dyed it pink. She said, “I feel like one of the issues with this guy I really like, was my hair and he made me really insecure about it.” She added, “A lot of guys are not attracted to a girl with short hair and it’s really annoying because I am the same person, just because I cut my hair doesn’t mean anything, it made me feel really insecure, like am I ugly? “I feel like Nigerians and young black people, we need to stop being so on the surface. We are putting ourselves under too much pressure. Even with makeup, lashes, we cannot kill ourselves. Even weight is a thing.” (sic) In response to the singer, reality star, Kiddwaya, said, “Let’s be honest, most ladies do this to attract a guy, and they say it’s for themselves. There is so much pressure recently on one’s self.” Otedola, who is currently studying at Oxford University, said the new look was based on her school and due to the fact that she does not want any distractions with long hair or makeup. She said, “People adore my sister, Temi; she is a fashionista and she is graceful. We are from the same parents, but I am never going to look like her. It is important that we don’t put ourselves under pressure.”
