 Gunmen on Sunday night Kidnapped the paramount ruler of Da Gwom Rwei of Vwang District of Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, HRH Da Gyang Balak Gut. The latest incident is coming less than a month after the traditional ruler of Gindiri town of Mangu LGA of the state, HRH Charles Dakat, was abducted. Our correspondent gathered that the traditional ruler was kidnapped on Sunday night on his way home in Vom, a few metres from the gate of the National Institute For Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru in Jos, after attending a meeting. Major Ishaku Takwa, the spokesman for the Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), confirmed the incident, saying “Troops of Operation Safe Haven in conjunction with other security agencies are on the trail of the kidnappers. God willing, the security agencies will soon close up on the criminals.” Also, the Spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, ASP Ubah Gabriel, confirmed the incident to newsmen in Jos. The police, however, said on Friday that efforts were on top gear to stop kidnapping activities in the state with police officers being stationed at strategic locations.
