As part of effort to meet its COVID-19 vaccination target, the Ogun State Government, through the Primary Health Care Development Board (OGPHCDB), has begun “Operation Campus Storm”, an exercise aimed at reaching over 400,000 eligible youths in and outside tertiary institutions in the state. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, disclosed this during the exercise at the Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED), Ijebu-Ode, saying statistics in the state revealed that there was a huge vaccination gap among people of ages 18 to 25, hence the need to focus on them, noting that the aim was to have 70 per cent coverage among students.
