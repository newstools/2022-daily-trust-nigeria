A Niger Delta Group has tipped Ibrahim Dauda, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, to contest the 2023 presidency. In a statement, Kingsley Kpakol, the Convener, and Ngozi Amadi, Secretary, said Dauda can contest on the platform of any party. “We the friends of Dr IBRAHIM BELLO DAUDA, from the 23 Local Government Areas of Rivers State, in South South Nigeria, after due deliberation, have resolved to make public our call for you, DR IBRAHIM BELLO DAUDA, to contest the 2023 Presidential General Elections on any political platform of your choice. “After wide consultation, we have come to the realisation that you, our dear friend, are the best choice for the race for election to the office of the President of Nigeria based on your personal qualifications. We see you as a global icon with an intimidating resume. You are a performer, a youth-friendly person with a huge and impressive network of admirers nationwide. “By our evaluation, you, Dr Dauda, are a man of integrity, a man with a heart for humanity; a philanthropist, an astute politician, and an inspiration to the younger generation. “Therefore, we, your friends, are urging you to come out and contest for the Presidency of Nigeria in 2023. We have resolved to join forces with you; and with God on our side, we will succeed. “We are convinced that your leadership of Nigeria will be a divine mandate for the liberation of our people. We are beating the drums for men, women and youths who want a change in our country to step forward openly and appeal to you to run for election as the next President of our great country in 2023.” Dauda was the national coordinator of Buhari Support Organisations in 2019.
