The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Monday accused the Customs Area Comptroller at the Murtala Muhammad Airport Area Command of breaching airport security. The Authority said at  about 1745hrs on Thursday, January 20, 2022, while the aviation security (AVSEC) officers on day duty at Gate 3 were profiling a vehicle trying to access the Security Restricted Area (SRA) via gate 3, the Customs Area Comptroller for Hajj and Cargo Terminal suddenly emerged. Spokesperson of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu in a statement said the Comptroller “pulled off behind the NAHCO vehicle that was being attended to and one CSC Agunbiade, a customs officer on the Area Comptroller’s entourage later shoved aside the AVSEC Officer at the gate.” FAAN stated that in the process, the officers in the entourage of the Comptroller forcefully took over the gate and opened the gate for the Comptroller and his escorts to forcefully access the Security Restricted Area via the gate. The statement added, “While accessing the gate, the armed escorts to the Comptroller threatened to beat up the AVSEC officers at the gate if they dare resist their assault and breach of security.” FAAN however frowned at the development, saying, “This blatant abuse of the privilege of bearing firearms by the NCS has become a recurrent threat to the Safety and Security of our Staff and our operations. But responding, the Service PRO, Mr. Joseph Attah in a chat with our correspondent described the allegation of security breach as “funny.” “How can they declare a gate restricted to customs? Their statement shows gross ignorance of the law. “Is there any attempt to preserve a particular gate without customs passing through it?”
