He was someone that literally just always made me smile. He would do absolutely anything to make me smile, no matter the issue or problems I had. “His response was always ‘don’t worry, I’ll talk to them’. ‘Don’t worry I’ll sort it out’. ‘Don’t worry I’ll give them something.

All my life it’s been ‘David you’re strong, David you’re strong.’ 44 I won’t lie to you, this time around, this one weak me. I miss you so much 44.”(sic)
