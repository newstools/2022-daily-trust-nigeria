German Automaker Mercedes-Benz has designed an electric car capable of travelling 1000 kilometres on a single charge. The Vision EQXX prototype, according to Mercedes, consumes less than 10-kilowatt hours of power per 100km due to sleeker design, greater efficiency and higher-density batteries. This is about three times the average range of most rechargeable vehicles. Daily Trust reports that most electric cars can travel just under 320kms before needing to recharge, but Mercedes-Benz said its new design puts an end to “range anxiety”. The new design is expected to eliminate the fear of running out of power on the road which is considered a key barrier to the wider adoption of electric cars even though most journeys are relatively short. Mercedes said its prototype “demonstrates just how efficient, sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be”. The design is expected to form the basis for cars going on sale in 2024 or 2025, it was learnt. The chief technology officer, Markus Schafer, who was silent on when the 1000km battery would be ready, said, “We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,” he said. The prototype comes less than two months after Chinese carmaker GAC Group unveiled its Axion LX Plus SUV, which it claims will be able to travel 1007 km (626 miles) on one charge. The Vision EQXX also features an interior made using sustainable materials including mushrooms, bamboo, cactus, and vegan silk. “These show that it is still possible to achieve the utmost in automotive luxury without using animal products, whilst creating an inimitable feeling of premium comfort. This fascinating journey has halved the carbon footprint of the leather alone,” Mercedes said in a statement. The prototype comes as BMW appeared to have overtaken its arch-rival in the global sales race for the first time since 2015.
