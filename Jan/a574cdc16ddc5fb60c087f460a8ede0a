I am not even on twitter. Football is meant for the fans and so they can say what they want. “Sometimes you get criticized and other times you get credit, so it normal and we must accept it and keep moving,” he said. He also revealed that he celebrated his call up to the national team after Victor Osimhen, Paul Onuachu and Odion Ighalo were confirmed absent in Cameroon. “ For all young lads growing up in Nigeria, it is always a dream to play for the Super Eagles. When I was called up, I felt great and my family celebrated with me. I don’t judge myself, I have to go back to the club and keep doing what I do best. It is from there I will get another call up,” he said.
