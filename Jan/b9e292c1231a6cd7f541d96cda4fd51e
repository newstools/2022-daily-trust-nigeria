The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said Nigerians who already have their Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) do not need to register again as the cards have not expired. The Chief Technical Adviser to the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Bolade Eyinla, said this on Wednesday in Abuja. He was responding to a former Lagos State Governor, Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu, who said the PVCs may have expired. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, in a trending video urged his supporters to go and take part in the ongoing ‘new registration’ because “the PVC you have has expired”. Prof. Eyinla said the PVCs issued in recent years remain valid for all elections being conducted by INEC, urging Nigerians not to attempt to register anew if they already have a PVC. “This information is not correct. The PVC issued to all previously registered voters remains valid. This kind of statement will certainly push eligible voters to register more than once thereby creating the problem of double and multiple registrations,” he said. On his part, the Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Mr. Rotimi Lawrence Oyekanmi, said Nigerians who already have their PVCs do not need to register again.
