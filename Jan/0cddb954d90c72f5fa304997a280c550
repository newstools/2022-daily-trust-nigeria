The Nigerian Navy has disclosed that it arrested 44 vessels involved in illegal bunkering in the country, which led to the recovery of N55.1 billion worth of crude oil as well as N11.8 billion Automotive Gas Oil (AGO). The volume of crude oil recovered was put at about 1.7 barrels of crude and 45,753 Metric Tons of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) valued at N55.1 billion and N11.8billion respectively in 2021. The Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, disclosed this when he gave a scorecard of the Nigerian Navy operational successes in 2021. He said there has been a marked decline in piracy in the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) in 2021 with 11 pirate incidents recorded compared to 44 in 2020. The CNS said the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Global Piracy Report of 14 July 2021, indicates the lowest total of piracy and sea robbery against ships in 27 years. He said similarly, there was a decline in pirate attacks and sea robbery in Nigeria’s water where the country reported only 11 pirate incidents and three sea robberies in 2021, as compared to 22 pirate incidents and 16 sea robberies in 2020. According to him, these figures convey proof of the effectiveness of the Nigerian Navy maritime security engagements.
