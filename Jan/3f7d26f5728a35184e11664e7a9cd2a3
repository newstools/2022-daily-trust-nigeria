Super Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has said he is ready to work with Portuguese manager, Jose Peseiro, at the end of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The 1994 AFCON winner played down taking over the reins on a permanent basis, saying he is ready to support the former FC Porto coach from his heart. “I was part of the group that interviewed a couple of coaches and as technical director I was involved, which is a full credit to the NFF.  It’s still up to the federation to decide. But if a contract has been signed, we have to respect it.” “The only thing I can guarantee is that if Jose Peseiro comes in, we are going to have a very good working relationship. I know the terrain, he doesn’t. “We have to provide him with the platform for him to be comfortable, relax and do the job. I will support him from the bottom of my heart 100%, because it’s not about me, it’s about the country,” BBC quoted him to have said. The former defender, who is in his third spell in charge of the Super Eagles, after managing the team from 2005-2007 prior to another stint as caretaker coach in 2010, stated further that he is only focused on the tournament. “My mandate is to work with these amazing players and colleagues in Cameroon.  We have given the players the freedom to enjoy themselves and the fans a reason to believe in the team again.” “But we can’t pay attention to those calling us the tournament favourites now. I have no control over what happens at the end of this competition. “Anything outside my mandate is not up to me and I just want to focus on the next opponent and take it from there,” he said.
