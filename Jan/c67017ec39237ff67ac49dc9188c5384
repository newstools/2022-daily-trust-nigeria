President Muhammadu Buhari has asked Nigerians to be fair in assessing his government as far as insecurity is concerned. The President spoke when he hosted the Grand Khalifa (overall head) of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement World-Wide, Tidjani Ali Bin Arabi, at Aso Rock, on Friday. Buhari said the present administration was well aware of its responsibility with regards to security and will continue to do its best. The President urged Nigerians to reflect on what obtained at the time he took over in 2015, and the “successes as well as performance which marked a decisive break from the past”, particularly in the North East and the South South. He added that the North West, which had given the nation some “headache” will experience a turnaround for the better. Buhari, in a statement issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu, urged citizens of the country to take responsibility and show interest in the affairs of their own security and complement what the government is doing. “We have done our best and we will continue to do more by pursuing coherent and consistent policies to deal with terrorism. I hope God will listen to our prayers,” he also said. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, who brought the visitors, while introducing the Khalifa and his delegation, which included the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, the leader of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement in Nigeria, said the government of Kano State invited the Tijjaniyya World Leader to the country to lead the faithful in prayer considering the complexities around security in particular. He said the visit of the Grand Khalifa had also rekindled the old ties between the Tijjaniya and the many cultural and educational institutions in Nigeria. The Tijjaniyya leader in the country, Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi and the Grand Khalifa, Tidjani Ali Bin Arabi, extolled the existing cordial relations between Nigeria and Algeria and prayed for guidance and blessings for the country and its leaders.
