The spokesman for the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairmanship Campaign Council for Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, Senator Victor Lar, has said the former governor can’t be schemed out of the race because of the key role he played in the formation of the party and its success at different stages. Reacting to reports that Sheriff had been edged out of the race, the spokesman for his Campaign Council, in a telephone chat with Daily Trust said, “He has been edged out on what grounds? “Has the APC concluded and announced the zoning formula? This is fake news targeted at de-marketing Senator Sheriff.” He also described as fake news, reports that the top shots of the party, including governors and those at the presidency, had narrowed down on four of the contenders out of the many vying for the chairmanship seat. Senator Lar said Sheriff has all it takes to strengthen and mobilize support for the party ahead of 2023 and appealed to other aspirants to step down and endorse Sheriff, a former governor of Borno State. “Some are saying the chairman should come from the North Central because certain people came from some blocs, no. “The legacy parties that constituted the APC, one of them, the CPC was one of the least of all, having only one governor that time with limited numbers in the National Assembly, yet, the presidential ticket was ceded to CPC. “This time around, the ANPP which was the second in ranking among the parties that came together and formed the APC which neither had a national chairman nor the vice presidential ticket nor the presidency should be considered. “Sheriff was the one who led ANPP coalition to the merger. So, having been in the merger and not having the pioneering slots, they should be considered this time. “So, I will appeal to all other aspirants to step down,” he said. He added that those harping on zoning were afraid of Sheriff.
