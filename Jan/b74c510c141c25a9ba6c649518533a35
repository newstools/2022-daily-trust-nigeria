National Coordinator of Rescue Nigeria Project (RNP), Usman Bugaje, has said political parties tradition of considering wealthy aspirants for their tickets to run for election is one of the factors worsening the nation’s challenges. Bugaje, who spoke yesterday in Abuja, during the inauguration of zonal and state coordinators of RNP, said that action by political parties was producing bad leaders and bad governance. “The leadership recruitment basis in our political parties does not prioritise knowledge or character rather, it is a matter of wealth or connection. “We know this very well. Go to any party; tell them you want to contest for the governorship of that state. The first question they will ask you is ‘do you have money?’ Nobody will ask you about your character, competence or certificate, no,” he said.
