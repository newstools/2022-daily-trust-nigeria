The Akwa Ibom State government has welcomed the petrochemical refinery and other investment projects planned by BUA, saying it will help to advance the economy of the state. The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Ini Ememobong, who stated this on Thursday in Uyo, said BUA petrochemical plant “is coming with a road project,” adding that it will open up the coastal areas of the state. Ememobong said with more than 20 kilometres of road which the company has promised to build in the state, there was the urgent need to support investment in the state. “The governor is struggling to bring investment and people are writing to scare away investors, threatening already existing companies. No matter where your pendulum will swing to, you will create a counter-report. “An investment is coming to your side and this is when you are choosing to start a fight. As enlightened as you are, don’t help them in the fight because they want to be heard. Reasoning will come to them that investment is coming here,” he stated. Ememobong said the Ibom Deep Seaport project in Mbo Local Government Area currently being promoted by the state government would also boost the economy of the state.
