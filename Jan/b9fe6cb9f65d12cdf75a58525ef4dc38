 After 10 years of organising a fellowship for advertising practitioners in Nigeria, the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) has inducted 63 members as fellows. This was due to the absence of a governing council which was dissolved as well as a substantive Registrar. The Registrar, Dr Olalekan Fadolapo made this known during the induction of new fellows on Wednesday in Lagos, Addressing the inductees, a former Chairman of Zenith Bank and an advert practitioner, Sir Steve Omojafor, urged them to ensure that the advertising and marketing communications industry in Nigeria excels in practice and profession as well as make an impact globally.
