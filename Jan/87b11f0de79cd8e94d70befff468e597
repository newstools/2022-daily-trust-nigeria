A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Segun Showunmi, has said proponents of “younger candidacy” cannot bully former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, out of the 2023 presidential race on account age. Showunmi, who was spokesman to Atiku as the PDP presidential candidate in 2019, expressed concern over “fixation on age” as the only parametre, especially to the high office of the presidency. The PDP chieftain, in a statement, said there are some “silly assumptions that the presidency of Nigeria is a stone quarry where the occupant is expected to use Stone Age tools to chip mountains.” His comment followed the position of Kassim Afegbua, another former Atiku spokesman, who advised the PDP to zone its presidential ticket to the South instead of considering the former vice president because of his age. Showunmi noted that President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent to the “Not Too Young To Run Bill” did not say the elderly must die.
