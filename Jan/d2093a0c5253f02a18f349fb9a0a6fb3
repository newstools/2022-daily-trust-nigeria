Angry passengers of Azman Air stormed the office of the airline in Kano, on Monday, over the cancellation of the 7am flight to Lagos. It was gathered that the airline informed the passengers of the cancellation, via e-mail, a few minutes to the scheduled departure. Some of the passengers, who said they had international flights to catch in Lagos, were furious that Azman sent them a cancellation notice few minutes to scheduled departure. Some of them said they were traveling to Lagos for connecting flights to London, Egypt, Dubai, Ghana and other destinations for medical reasons. The passengers later mobilised themselves at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) and stormed the airline’s office at Zaria road in protest. The protest was still ongoing as of 9:20am when our reporter filed this story and the airline is yet to give reason for the cancellation of the flight aside the “operational reasons” stated in its generic message to the passengers. But Lawal Suleiman, General Manager, AZMAN Air in Kano, assured passengers of refund or the option of arranging another flight by Wednesday evening. Daily Trust reports that the airline had similar issues last year which led to a scuffle between passengers and officials of the airline at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) after several cancellation of flights. The airline’s license was suspended by the government afterwards but was later reinstated.
