No fewer than 50 aides have been appointed by Comrade Dahiru Umar, popularly known as Seriki Arewa, the departmental President of Physical and Health Education, University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID). Commenting on the development in a chat with Daily Trust, Dahiru said the number is few compared to those jostling for leadership roles. Our correspondent reports that among those appointed were Head of service Internal, Head of the service External, Chief of Staff Internal, Chief of Staff External, a Principal Private Secretary, ADC and 2 Senior Special Advisers. Others include; five Senior Special Assistants, 25 special assistants, three personal assistants, two ambassadors, three directors, Chairman Class Rep Forum, among others. Dahiru said they would assist him in carrying out his duties, especially during social week activities in the department. “As you can see, this department, I think it is the second-largest or the largest in the University of Maiduguri; so that’s why I appointed these few people. Many are calling me to complain that they were not appointed, because we have more than 5,000 students in this department. “To me, as to why I appointed 50 aides, they are to help us in so many departmental programmes. We are currently planning a social week,  So, these people we appointed will be assisting us in organising and coordinating our activities in the department; and above all, it is all about politics, “Dahiru said.
