The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has described as false a claim that it doesn’t have emergency response facilities at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. FAAN was reacting to a video on social media showing a passenger about to board an Air Peace flight from Abuja who collapsed but didn’t get an emergency response. Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, said “the passenger in question received immediate attention as a FAAN officer, Mr. Ajani, immediately revived the unconscious passenger by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the passenger before the arrival of the medical team, which arrived shortly after to administer first aid treatment and subsequently evacuated the passenger to the Airforce Base clinic. “We appeal to stakeholders to always be orderly and proactive in the face of emergency situations as on that day, a Port Health officer on duty was intimidated and hindered from assisting the sick passenger. “Interference, threats and agitations only undermine the focus on saving lives, and further slowing the emergency response process,” the statement stated. FAAN appealed that “the privacy of any distressed person(s) in our facilities be always respected by desisting from just merely watching, and recording such persons for public broadcast. To succeed in resolving emergencies, we do need more hands on deck, than on phone.”
