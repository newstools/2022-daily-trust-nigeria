The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, on Monday, ordered security personnel attached to the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) to kill anyone who attempts to breach security at correctional facilities. He described Correctional (Prison) facilities across the country as a red zone, saying anyone who attempt to attack it should not live to tell the story. Aregebsola, who gave the directive while addressing senior officers at the Agodi Custodial Centre of the NCoS, said such people should not be allowed to live. He said the officers must make it impossible for anyone to penetrate the facility, saying such an attempt must remain an attempt. Aregbesola said, “The most important thing is the security impregnability of this facility. This is a red zone, dangerous zone. Whoever attempts to breach the facility is already dead. He must not live to tell the story. “Any effort to breach our facility is not acceptable. Don’t shot to injure but shot to kill for any reason. This is a total embodiment of the state to guarantee the security of the people.” He assured the officers that the government will do its best in ensuring that their welfare is a top priority as a way of ensuring effective service delivery. “We will do our best on your welfare to ensure effective service. “I must commend your work for not recording any case of Covid-19 in your facility. “You must be effective in preventing the penetration of this facility. “You must have the capacity to repell viciously any attempt to attack or invade this facility and an attempt must remain an attempt.”
