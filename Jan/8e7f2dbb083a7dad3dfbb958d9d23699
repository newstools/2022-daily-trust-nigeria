 An Appeal court sitting in the Central Area, Abuja, on Friday, affirmed Alhaji Muhammad Angulu Loko as the chairmanship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the February 12, 2022 council election in Abaji Area Council. The presiding judge, Hon Justice Aliyu Abubakar Gumel, while delivering judgement in an appeal filed by Abubakar Umar Abdullahi, said the appeal filed by the second respondent (Abubakar Umar Abdullahi) lacked merit and was thereby dismissed. He said the five issues raised for determination of the appeal were resolved against the appellant in favour of the first respondent (Mohammed Angulu Loko), noting that the judgment of the FCT High Court of November 16, 2021 which declared Alhaji Mohammed Angulu Loko as the APC chairmanship candidate for the February 12, 2022 election in Abaji Area Council was affirmed. “After carefully going through all the five issues raised, there are all resolved in favour of the first respondent against the appellant. “Hence, this appeal fails and lacking in merit is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the FCT High Court of November 16, 2021 is hereby affirmed,” he said.
