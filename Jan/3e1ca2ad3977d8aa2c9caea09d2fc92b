Ten customers of Fidelity Bank Plc have become N1million richer having received their cash prizes for emerging winners in the January draw of the Bank’s Get Alert in Millions savings promo, season 5 (GAIM 5). The prizes were presented on Thursday, 27 January at an event held at Fidelity Bank, Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos and several branches across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. A visibly elated Stanley Okpoto -one of the winners- said, “I am more than happy to receive this cash prize from Fidelity Bank. Being a long-time customer and follower of the bank, I feel special and grateful that as little as N2,000  earned me so much money.” Also speaking at the well-attended event, the promo Chairman and Executive Director in charge of the bank’s Lagos and South-West Directorate, Dr Ken Opara, said the ceremony marks a special celebration for the bank being the first prize presentation for the year and therefore sets the tone for the remaining prize presentations to be held in the year. “Asides from Stanley and Ajoma, eight other customers of Fidelity Bank will receive cash prizes at similar events holding simultaneously at some of our branches across Nigeria. These customers only had to maintain a minimum of N2,000 in their Fidelity Bank accounts to emerge winners. That is the beauty of the GAIM 5 savings promo,” explained Dr Ken Opara, who was represented by the bank’s Chief Digital Officer, Lanre Showunmi. According to the bank, the promo employs a ticketing approach whereby each N2,000 in customers’ accounts represents a ticket in the draws.
