Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have arrested three drug traffickers while trying to smuggle 48,000 tablets of 225mg tramadol through Mubi, Adamawa State, to the Republic of Cameroon. The spokesman of the agency, Femi Babafemi, said the suspects, Mohammed Hussaini (32), Adamu Bello (18) and Mohammed Umar (18), were arrested at Tsamiya Junction, Madanya Road in Mubi on Friday, January 28, with the exhibits concealed in the packets of another drug. When interviewed, the suspects claimed that the drugs were being taken to Bagira town on the Nigeria-Cameroon border to be delivered to some Cameroonians for onward delivery to Maroua in Cameroon. Babafemi added that the NDLEA intercepted a consignment of 22 international passports of six different countries concealed in a bag of garri. He said the interception was at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos State. “Nine of the passports were three each of UK, France and Portugal, while the rest were Nigeria eight; Ghana four and Cameroon one. Also at the airport, operatives equally recovered 12 parcels of cannabis weighing 4.95kg concealed in a carton of Golden Morn packaged for export through the SAHCO export shed,” Babafemi said. He further said raids at Alaba Rago area of Lagos led to the interception of 1,200 parcels of imported Loud, a strong variant of Indian hemp, suspected to have been smuggled into the state from a neighbouring country with a total weight of 1,229kg. The spokesman also said assorted drugs were seized in Lagos, Edo and Jigawa, while three suspects were arrested in two different local governments for being in possession of 126.5g of methamphetamine and Indian hemp.
