The South West Agenda (SWAGA) for Tinubu’s 2023 presidential ambition has backed the aspiration of former Minister of Works, Sen Dayo Adeyeye, for the January 27, All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship pri.mary. The group stated that they decided to back Adeyeye in view of their unflinching belief that he possessed the competence, capability, cognate experience and the cognitive knack to lead Ekiti as governor and reform the state in all spheres. Shortly after Adeyeye joined the governorship race, some chieftains of the group raised reservations over such attempt, which created a cleavage within SWAGA, thereby igniting apathy within the group. The group endorsed Adeyeye for the coveted seat at its reunion meeting held in Ado-Ekiti on Monday, where its top members, including an Australia-based medical doctor and SWAGA chieftain, Dr Wole Oluyede, were present. Speaking at the meeting, Dr Oluyede saluted Adeyeye, who is the National Coordinator of the Pro-Tinubu group, describing SWAGA as a formidable political movement in Ekiti APC and across Nigeria that was determined to entrench the doctrine of good governance in the nation. The SWAGA Chairman in Ekiti State, Chief Tony Adeniyi, described SWAGA as an unstoppable political movement in the state. In his speech, Adeyeye appreciated the gesture and charged the group to act as true defenders and proponents of democracy by preventing those planning to disrupt the primary from accomplishing their devilish mission. Meanwhile, the Ekiti Concerned Citizens Group (ECCG) has warned governorship aspirants from Ekiti South Senatorial District not to accept the deputy governorship slot from any party.
