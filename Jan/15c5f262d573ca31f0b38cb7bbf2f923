Indomitable Lions of Cameroon became the first team to book their place in the knockout stage of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations following their 4-1 thrashing of Ethiopia at Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé. Captain Vincent Aboubakar and strike partner Toko Ekambi each scored a brace after Dawa Dukele had given Ethiopia the lead inside the first five minutes of the match. Cameroon raised their tally to six points to secure their Round of 16 spot, while Ethiopia remained pointless after two games. The Waliya Antelopes broke the deadlock inside four minutes through a Dawa Dukele who finished a sweeping counter. The Ethiopians won possession inside their area breaking into the Indomitable Lions half with Abubeker Nasir playing in Amanuael Aregawi whose cut back found Dawa Dukele slot past Onana. As in their opening match Cameroon came from behind to win it this time through Karl Ekambi who headed Collins Fai’s brilliant cross. The Indomitable Lions continued to put more men forward as they looked for the lead at the Olembe Stadium. The hosts crashed the Waliya Antelopes post through Ekambi five minutes before the break while Onana produced a brilliant low two handed save to deny Surafel Dagnachew on the stroke of halftime. The second half saw both sides going all out for the winner but it was Cameroon who found the back of the net on 53 minutes through captain Aboubakar. The former FC Porto man headed down Collins Fai’s delightful cross past the helpless Balcha to make it 2-1. Aboubakar doubled his tally just after the restart with a poacher’s finish from Moumi Ngamaleu’s neat square ball for his fourth of the tournament. Ekambi curled a cracking effort towards the far corner forcing a save from Balcha before the hour mark before scoring the winner on 67 minutes. The Indomitable Lions have now recorded back-to-back wins ahead of their last Group A match against Cape Verde who will play Burkina Faso.
