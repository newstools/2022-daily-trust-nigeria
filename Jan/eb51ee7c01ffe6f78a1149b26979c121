An expatriate with Hartland Construction Company, who was kidnapped in Edo State some days ago, has regained freedom. The expatriate was kidnapped at Idegun Community, Anwain clan, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo, on Wednesday. He was supervising the construction of Idegun Awain road when gunmen killed his police orderly and abducted him. It was gathered that he was released to his employer at Anegbette, a village in Etsako Central local government of the state after the payment of undisclosed ransom. Residents of Anwain community are now concerned that the road project might be abandoned due to insecurity.
