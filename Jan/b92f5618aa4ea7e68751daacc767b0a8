The All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed February 26, 2022, for its convention. Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, announced this at the APC Progressive Women Conference in Abuja, on Tuesday. The governor urged the women to come out massively and contest in the forthcoming “national convention holding by 26th of February 2022.” “We look forward to having more women contesting in the forthcoming National Convention of the party slated for February 26th, 2022 and the 2023 general election. The party under my stewardship conducted the membership registration and revalidation exercise. We found it expedient to constitute a Special committee on Women and Youths before the commencement of the exercise.” “The roles you played made the membership registration and revalidation exercise a huge success.” Buni emphasized that women constitute a large proportion of Nigeria’s population with a good number of them doing the nation proud.
“You remain the best mobilizers of support to any political party and its candidates. You have always been there on queue on election days to determine the fate of candidates,” he said. He said after last year’s revalidation exercise, the party realised that it has over 40 million members. Buni said this puts APC in a good stead to win the 2023 general elections. “The figure has asserted our position as Africa’s largest political party and of course, Nigeria’s leading political party. With this, we are confident of winning the 2023 elections with huge success,” he said. He assured the support of the party to youths and women to actualize their political ambitions. “Let me once again assure you that APC will continue to support you, and to support you generously,” he said.
