The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State on Tuesday challenged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to work on its “bad image and be more responsible” by conducting fair and credible elections in 2023. The State Chairman, Sikirulahi Ogundele, said this on Tuesday at the party secretariat in Abeokuta, while receiving officials of the commission from the state headquarters. Officials of the Election and Party Monitoring Department, INEC, Ogun State, had visited the PDP secretariat as part of the ongoing inspection of 17 political parties’ offices across the state. In his address, Ogundele noted that previous elections were marred by manipulation of results, ballot boxes snatching and violence, saying Nigerians yearn for a “more responsible” electoral umpire in 2023. The leader of the INEC team and Head of the Election and Party Monitoring Department, Akanni Abidakun, said the commission was on a routine exercise to validate the address of party secretariat, list of executives and documents submitted to the electoral body. Responding to Ogundele’s position, he said “We (INEC) will try as much as possible to create a level playing field for all the political parties before, during and after the election.”
