 The Concerned Progressives, a socio-political group in Taraba, on Sunday called on politicians in the state to shun divisive campaigns ahead of the 2023 general election. Leader of the group, El-Qassim Ishaq made the call at a press conference in Jalingo, saying divisive campaigns were capable of creating disunity and hatred among the people. He said that the state was already backward and appealed to politicians in the state to stop dividing people along ethnic and religious lines. Ishaq advised that politicians should pay more attention  to  uniting the people in order to move the state forward. “It is time for those who were aspiring for various political offices to set aside their political, ethnic and religious sentiments and join forces to create a government that would work to salvage the state,” he said. He also urged politicians to build bridges of understanding rather than exploiting differences among the people for their personal and political gains.
