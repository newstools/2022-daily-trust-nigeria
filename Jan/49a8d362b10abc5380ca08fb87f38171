A 45-year-old man, James Francis, was on Monday docked in a Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court for alleged N5.5 million fraud. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp Chidi Leo, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 15, 2021 in Barnawa, Kaduna. Leo said that the defendant collected N5.5 million from the complainant, Benjamin Titus, under the pretext of selling an uncompleted bungalow building to him. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defence counsel, Mr Olalekan Abayomi, applied for bail for his client in the most liberal terms. Chief Magistrate Ibrahim Emmanuel admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the case to Jan. 29 for hearing. (NAN)
