The fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has been fixed for judgment on 19th January 2022 by the High Court of Abia State sitting in Umuahia. The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has, however, expressed confidence that the court will uphold the law. Chief Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, CUPP’s spokesperson, said given the overriding importance of this case, CUPP hereby, called on Abia High Court, particularly, the judge handling the case, to be courageous and resist any external pressures or interference. He said the judge must be firm and do justice while declaring the law as it is. The CUPP further condemned all illegal actions against Nigerian citizens many of whom are in ‘illegal detention’ and called on the relevant agencies of the state to take necessary and urgent actions to reverse the trend. He said Nigerian citizens must be allowed the freedom to express their genuinely held views as guaranteed under the 1999 Constitution and do so without fear of intimidation or any harm. ”This government has clearly restricted the space for Nigerians to exercise their freedom of speech. “We are, however, hopeful that the judiciary will stand up at these times and be counted. “We ask for no favours, we only demand that the law be declared as it is without bowing to any external influences,” he said.
