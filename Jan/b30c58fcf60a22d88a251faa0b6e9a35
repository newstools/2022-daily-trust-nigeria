A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, says he is yet to make a decision to contest the presidential election in 2023. Kwankwaso, in an interview with DW Hausa on Wednesday, said consultations were in progress with appropriate people. He said: “In this kind of situation we are not rushing to make decisions. “So, we are critically watching and consulting the right people to advise us and whatever I decide will be communicated to our people. “We have huge support that is enough to contest for anything. “We have people everywhere not only in Nigeria. Some people think that we only have people in Kano or in the north, but the truth is we have people in Asia, America and Europe,” Kwankwaso said. On the rumours circulating that he would dump his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Kwankwaso said there was nothing like that. “The issue of my decamping to APC has been raised severally at different times.” “This is not the first time. Many people are saying it and this is worth celebrating in politics that you become the talk of the news all the time. “It is a symbol of integrity and that people are always with us. “For now, I’m not aware of this and I’m not in any discussion with anybody about decamping to APC. So, that is it for now.” He said politics is all about patience and hard work, and that it was normal with the system to experience good and bad situations.
