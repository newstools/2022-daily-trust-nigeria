The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved two projects worth over N56.2 billion for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The FCT Minister, Malam Muhamad Musa Bello, disclosed this to newsmen at the end of the FEC meeting on Wednesday. The minister, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, said the projects were for the full scope development of the airport expressway to Kuje Junction (Stage 1) at the cost of N54,946,909,160.04, and a car park for the Abuja Light Rail, Gbazango Station (Lot 7), at the sum of N1,291,568,845.33. He explained that the Kuje to airport expressway project became necessary because the existing two-lane single carriageway was grossly inadequate to carry the current traffic. The statement reads in part: “When fully constructed, the road will open up for development parts of Phase V of the Federal Capital City (FCC), as well as open up the Kuje Satellite Town, while connecting the airport expressway to the future Outer Southern Expressway (OSEX) in line with the Abuja Master Plan. “The project will also decongest the vehicular traffic originating from the Federal Capital City (FCC) to Kuje and provide free traffic flow along the route, as well as provide an alternative route to Gwagwalada road.” On the access road and car park for the Abuja Light Rail, Gbazango Station, Malam Bello said public attraction to the completed Gbazango Train Station necessitated the need to provide immediate access to and from the train station and to further enhance maximum functionality of the Abuja Rail Mass Transit System (ARMTS) of the FCC due to commence operations.
