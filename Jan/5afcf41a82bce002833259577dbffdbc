Super Eagles defender, Chidozie Awaziem, on Monday, joined his teammates for training for the first time in Garoua. The defender has recovered from the ankle injury that he suffered. On Friday, Coach Augustine Eguavoen, had said Awaziem missed Saturday’s clash against Sudan because of his injury. “Hopefully soon, that is beyond my control. I think if the medical staff were here now they will certify him fit to be back on the pitch. “Awaziem is still down, he has an ankle injury as I know and he is going to be back very, very soon,” he had said. But the defender trained with other players on Monday. It is unclear if he would feature in the game against Guniea-Bissau.
