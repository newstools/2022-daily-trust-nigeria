Senate President Ahmad Lawan has called on Nigerian politicians to build consensus among themselves irrespective of political affiliations and work only in the interest of the country. He gave the charge at a reception organised in his honour in Abuja, on Wednesday night, by a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu and his wife, Ifunanya, to mark the 63rd birthday of the Senate president. Addressing the gathering, Lawan said the kind of consensus he wanted should centre around fundamental issues about the country below which none of them should go irrespective of their political affinities. He said the Senate under his watch was able to achieve its set target because of its consensus to work for the country.
