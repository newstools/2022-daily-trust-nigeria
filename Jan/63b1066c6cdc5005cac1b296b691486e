Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja,  inaugurated an Expanded Partnership Committee on Sustainable Blue Economy. The committee, chaired by Osinbajo, is composed of state governors, ministers, representatives of military and security agencies and members from the private sector. The committee’s terms of reference include providing an assessment of the current realities, opportunities and challenges for economic diversification and the growth of a sustainable blue economy in Nigeria.
