President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled his scheduled visit to Zamfara state, citing poor weather condition. Governor Bello Matawalle announced this on Thursday, saying the President, who was scheduled to take off from Sokoto aboard helicopter, had to postpone the visit due to poor visibility. “Mr President has spoken to me and asked me to convey his apologies to the good people of the state. Mr President said he would reschedule the visit to the state next week and the fixed date would be communicated to us in due course,” Matawalle said. “Some of the security chiefs are currently in Katsina but can’t fly to Zamfara for the same reason. Based on this, we are extending our apology to the good people of the state over the postponement for reason beyond our control. We thank Mr President for his love for the state. Earlier, Buhari had commissioned a three million metric tonnes cement plant of BUA in Sokoto. The President was accompanied by the Governor of Sokoto State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefele; Chairman of BUA Group, Alhaji AbdulSamad Rabi”u and Chairman of Max Air, Alhaji Dahiru Bara’u Mangal, among others.
