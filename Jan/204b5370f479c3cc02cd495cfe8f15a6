Popular Nigerian dancer, Kaffy, has given a shocking revelation as she has announced to the world that her union with Joseph Ameh, a music director and drummer, is over. The pair got married on June 2, 2012, and have two children together. Fondly called Nigeria’s dance queen, Kaffy took to her verified Instagram account to give reasons why her married crashed.

Marriage is supposed to be an alignment of destinies driving towards a place that God wants us to be and mine really did not work out that way. “Rather than looking at somebody as a problem, you could be the problem of that person. Being an enabler of someone not being able to do what they are supposed to do can also be that you are not supposed to be in that space. “So, there was a lot to learn and there is still a lot more to learn. I want to express that and motivate you to understand that life is not all about reaction to the world; it is not about reacting to what want you to say or what the world wants to hear; what the world wants you to be or what the world wants you to wear; what the world wants you to look like or get married.” Kaffy’s dancing career took off after she went to an event to perform onstage by someone who spotted her when she used to go to the National Stadium during weekends for dance rehearsals and workouts. In 2006, Kaffy led her dance group to break the Guinness Book of Record for “Longest Dance Party” after they danced for 55hours and 40minutes. She is currently a dance instructor who has developed innovative visualisation-based methods for teaching dance and dance fitness in an accelerated-learning format.  See post below:
