The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will deploy 12,000 ad hoc personnel for the February 12 area council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Alhaji Yahaya Bello, said this on Wednesday in Abuja during a town hall meeting with women groups and gender-focused civil society organizations organised by the European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES), INEC, Yiaga Africa, European Union (EU) and others. This commission also assured that it would provide level playing field for candidates participating in the election. Bello, represented by the Administrative Secretary of INEC in the FCT, Barrister Waziri Zannah, expressed the commission’s readiness to conduct a free and fair poll, assuring of a level playing field for all stakeholders. He charged women groups to sensitise and mobilise other women and youth to come out en masse during the election and to vote for their preferred candidates.
