An All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant for the Ekiti State governorship election slated for June 18, Hon Olufemi Bamisile, said he has the capacity to defeat any aspirant anointed by Governor Kayode Fayemi, at the party primary. Bamisile, a House of Representatives member from the state, submitted his forms on Thursday at the party secretariat in Abuja. He told newsmen that not all aspirants and candidates anointed by the incumbent at state and federal levels win the ticket or election. ‘Consensus best option for APC’ On his part, a former member of the House of Representatives from Ekiti State, Hon Bamidele Faparusi, said consensus is the best option for choosing a candidate of the party. In an interview with newsmen on Thursday in Abuja, after obtaining his expression of interest and nomination forms, Faparusi said a consensus that is just, transparent, free and fair would produce a better result for the party. He also asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to set high targets for itself ahead of the polls, adding that in every election, there is room for improvement of the processes. “Consensus is in our constitution; we have direct primary, indirect primary and consensus. “So, consensus would have been the best if it is done in a transparent, equitable and justice manner that will be acceptable to all. “It should be a consensus that we can defend; consensus that will not be an imposition. It must be based on something that we all agreed on,” he said.
