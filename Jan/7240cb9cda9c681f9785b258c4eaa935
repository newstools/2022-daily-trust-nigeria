A security source, who was part of the operation but preferred anonymity, said the suspected kidnappers’ informants were arrested on Thursday morning at Mayaki village. He said the arrest of one of the suspects at Rafindaji led to the arrest of six others. “It was the arrest of one of the informants who led the abduction of a Fulani man in Rafindaji that resulted to the arrest of six other informants,” he said. He said the seven suspects have been taken to Lapai police division in Niger State for further investigation. The village chief of Gulida, Sadauna Abubakar, confirmed the arrest of seven suspected informants, saying they have been moved to Lapai division in Niger State. “Yes, it is true some informants have been arrested in Rafindaji. And even as I am talking to you now, they have been moved to Lapai police division in Niger State,” he said. The spokesman of the Niger State Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached to confirm the arrest as his phone was not connecting.
