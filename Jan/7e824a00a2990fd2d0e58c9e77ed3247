Nigeria’s standout player at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, Moses Simon, has said the primary goal for the Super Eagles at the ongoing championship in Cameroon is the trophy at stake. The Super Eagles of Nigeria last won the prestigious Cup in 2013 when the hugely underrated team which was coached by Coach Stephen Keshi won Nigeria’s third title. After their appearance in South Africa, the Super Eagles missed out on the next two editions before grabbing a third place finish at the last edition in Egypt. Although only a few people gave them any chance of performing in Cameroon, the Super Eagles have silenced most of their critics with eye-catching performances which have earned for them a place in the Round of 16. Reacting to his team’s performance so far, the Nantes of France attacking winger said “We all have one goal, it is not about playing. It’s all about winning the Cup. We talk to each other. Everyone believes in the same objective and we are ready to make it happen. “I can’t really say how far we can go in this tournament. We just need to take things step by step,” he said.
