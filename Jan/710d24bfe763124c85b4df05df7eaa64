The United Nations has charged the federal government through the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) to take enormous responsibility in leading the innovative efforts towards fighting against maritime crimes in the Gulf of Guinea and across the continent. The international agency, through one of its units, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also tasked Nigeria not to relent in taming all maritime problems classified as national security threats currently affecting the economy of the country. The threats, according the Executive Director of the UNODC, Ghada Fathi Wali, range from kidnapping of oil workers, sea robbery and piracy, incessant problems of crude oil theft, illegal bunkering, hostage-taking and maritime terrorists. In a statement made available on Thursday by ONSA’s Head of Strategic Communication, Zakari Usman, the NSA, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), noted that his office is committed to strengthen legal, administrative and operational efforts in line with national maritime security objectives. The office also said one of the gaps identified by the federal government in the fight against maritime crimes, was the weak legal and institutional framework for prosecuting offenders. “But aside from creating a legal and institutional framework for prosecuting maritime crimes, the Federal Government has also prioritised the provision of maritime intelligence facilities. “For instance, President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned a state-of-the-art Falcon Eye Maritime Intelligence Facility at the Naval Headquarters in Abuja last year. “The set-up and operationalisation of the project was facilitated by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) as part of efforts to boost Nigeria’s overall maritime security architecture,” the statement read.
