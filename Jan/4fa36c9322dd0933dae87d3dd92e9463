Nigerian artiste manager and politician, Ubi Franklin, has shared his thoughts about marriage and what the actual reality is. In a Twitter post, the music mogul said people don’t need to focus so much on getting married. He said, “If you go on your knees to engage a woman and she needs people to shout “say yes” before she takes the ring y’all not there yet.
We need to understand that from past experience, we date sometimes to satisfy our immediate need, not necessarily material things(money) No” “Marriage is not a must, some stories you hear about marriage these days you will understand we need to sort some fundamental problems that are left unsaid. Some people don’t even know why they are getting married, domes just want the attention on their wedding day. It’s deeper.” The founder of the record label, ‘Made Men Music’ was once married to a Nigerian actress, Lilian Esoro, and they have a son together. The duo got married in 2015, surprisingly the marriage ended even before a year. Aside his son with the actress, Franklin has a daughter and a son from two other women.
