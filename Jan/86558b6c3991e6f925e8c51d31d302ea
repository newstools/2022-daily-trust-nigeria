The recent moves by former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, to reconcile with his erstwhile deputy and senator representing Ekiti South District, Biodun Olujimi, have changed the political calculation in the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Fayose and Olujimi have been at loggerheads over the control of the party structure in the state since the former left office in 2018. The two leaders met again in the early hours of yesterday in Lagos and reaffirmed their commitment to work together for the victory of the PDP in the forthcoming governorship election. Fayose, who is the leader of the Osoko Political Assembly (OPA) is supporting Otunba Bisi Kolawole to pick the ticket of PDP while Olujimi, who is the leader of the Repositioning Group, is aiming to fly the flag of the party in the June 18 election. The meeting, which is the fourth between the groups in the past three weeks, was attended by Fayose, Olujimi, Senator Duro Faseyi, Otunba Yinka Akerele and Hon Deji Ogunsakin. Fayose and Olujimi, in a statement, assured members of the party that the on going talks and reconciliation will lead the party to victory. Daily Trust gathered that the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, had met the duo last year and mandated them to resolve their differences before the primaries. However, the moves have put other aspirants, who were hoping to take advantage of the disagreement between the leaders, in the cold. There are about 15 other aspirants, including former governor Segun Oni, who is said to be the most popular in the race. Fayose’s immediate deputy and anointed candidate in the 2018 poll, Professor Kolapo Olusola Eleka, is also defying his former boss to seek the party’s ticket. PDP has fixed January 26 to elect its flag bearer for the poll while the ruling All Progressives Congress will elect its candidate on January 27.
