Primary schools teachers in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have begun an indefinite strike over some pending arrears with area councils in the territory. Comrade Ameh Baba, Chairman, National Union of Teachers, Kubwa chapter, confirmed the strike action to Daily Trust on Wednesday morning. He said the development was as a result of a circular from their union the previous day. Baba stated that the area councils are owing their members a log of arrears that cut across payment in promotion, and minimum wage beginning from 2011. The NUT leader said part of their agreement to call off the previous strike last November was due to the intervention of FCT Senator Philip Aduda, who said that they would start implementing the demands immediately. “But they are yet to abide by the promise, and it seems they are more concerned with their campaign event that is currently taking the palace,” he said. Daily Trust reports that the primary school teachers went on strike about three times last year. The last strike action lasted for two weeks.
