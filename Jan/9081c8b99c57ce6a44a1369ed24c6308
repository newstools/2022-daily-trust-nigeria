Former council chairmen in Lagos State yesterday commenced mass mobilisation for the presidential aspiration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The former council bosses under the aegis of Grassroots Network for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu (GNAT), said they cannot afford to betray their benefactors. According to them, Tinubu is an eminent politician who has built many notable actors, including Governor Kayode Fayemi, Muiz Banire (SAN), Lai Mohammed, Rauf Aregbesola, Babatunde Fashola, among others. GNAT comprises serving and former local government chairmen, councillors, supervisors, secretaries to the local government, secretaries to education, special advisers, special assistants and other political appointees at the local government level. Leader of the group, Abiodun Mafe, who spoke at the formation of the group in Lagos, said the foot soldiers cannot afford to be ingrates to the former Lagos governor, who played a great role in their rise to prominence.
