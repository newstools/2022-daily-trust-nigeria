The NNPC Ltd has assured the public that the Company has sufficient Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or petrol in stock to meet the needs of Nigerians. The Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Garba Deen Muhammad, in a statement on Wednesday, said, “The public is therefore, advised not to engage in panic buying of petrol; and to ignore all rumours that may suggest otherwise. “In line with the existing laws of the land, NNPC Ltd. is deeply committed to ensuring energy security for the country.” Daily Trust reports that vehicular queues started mounting at a few fuel stations on Tuesday as most stations shut their gates. A survey across the major sections of the capital city, from Kubwa, Nyanya and within the city centre indicated that only few stations were dispensing petrol and had pockets of queues which were mounting more as of Tuesday morning. At the Jabi axis where NIPCO was dispensing, the vehicular queue had taken over a lane on the road spanning nearly 100 metres. “I have gone to A.A Rano, Mobil, Ardova PLC and Conoil but they are not selling. I don’t know what is happening now,” said Razaq Kunle, a taxi driver on the queue at NIPCO. Petrol hawkers are often referred to as ‘black marketers’ already having a field day as they sell 10 litre of petrol for N2,500. As of Wednesday, some fuel stations in Abuja opened their gates to motorists to sell products.
