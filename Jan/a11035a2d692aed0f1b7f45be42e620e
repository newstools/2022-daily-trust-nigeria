If he eventually becomes the national chairman, he will uphold the APC constitution, respect the party’s organs, among others,” he said. He said Al-Makura, who represents Nasarawa South Senatorial District stands tall among all other aspirants in the race considering his experience, capability, integrity, and support among all interests in the party.
