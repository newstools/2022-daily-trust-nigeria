Mr Mudashiru Obasa, Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, has described the death of Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya, a former Secretary to the State Government, as a major loss to the state. Obasa said this in a statement issued in Ikeja on Tuesday. Adeniran-Ogunsanya, who served the state during the first term of former Gov. Babatunde Fashola between 2007 and 2011, died at 74 on Tuesday after a brief illness. The speaker commiserated with the family and friends of the deceased, saying her contributions to the progress of Lagos State, while she was SSG, would remain indelible in the hearts of the residents. Obasa said: “She was always calm, filled with brilliant ideas and contributed immensely to the development of Lagos while she served as Secretary to the Lagos State Government. “The late Adeniran-Ogunsanya also played important roles in the politics of the state earning herself respect as a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “On behalf of my colleagues at the Lagos State House of Assembly, I commiserate with the family, friends, leaders of our party and everyone affected by the demise of Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya.” He prayed that God grant her soul peaceful repose and give those she left behind the fortitude to bear the loss.
