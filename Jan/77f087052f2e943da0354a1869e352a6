We give God all the glory for this New Year, 2022. As a cleric, I owe my country a duty to pray for the people. Here I bring some prayers from the ‘Total Blessing 2022’ ministration. May all evil prophesies never come to pass on any one of us. Our God is sufficient for all our needs in 2022 and beyond. We need to ask God for peace to reign during the 2022 election in Osun and Ekiti states, and for God to keep our souls from blood-drinkers in the states during and after the elections. No one deserves to be killed. Our politicians, including the leaders and followers, should play the game according to the rules of God during and after the elections. Fighting, killing, and destruction should not be part of our elections. Religious leaders should declare fasting and prayers for the elections in Osun and Ekiti to avert any chaos or blood-letting. Our churches are admonished to cry more to God so that the ambitions of anybody would not bring destruction to our state and nation. We also need to plead with God to save us from the work of bandits, kidnappers, and herdsmen. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should do its work as an independent body during the elections. They should stand by the rules. Reverend Dr Isaac Oluyamo, JP, writes from Ijebu-Ijesa, Osun State
