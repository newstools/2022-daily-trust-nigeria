The poster-boy of Nigeria and Africa table tennis, Aruna Quadri, has broken his own record to achieve a new feat in the world ranking after the Nigerian hit 11th spot in the February 2022 international table tennis federation (ITTF) world rating. The former African champion raised the bar for African players with the new ranking as the first athlete from the continent to hit 11th spot in the world ranking. He rose to 14th in the world ranking after his quarterfinal finish at the 2021 World Championships in Houston, United States to become the first African in history to reach that height. Having started 2022 as the 14th best player in the world but after gaining three steps up in the ranking, Aruna now occupies 11th place. According to the new rating, Aruna’s feat was made possible following his exploits in 2021 as the latest ranking made use of performance in 2021 for the latest rating. An excited Aruna admitted that the feat means more hard work for him on the table. “This is indeed a big challenge for me, and I hope this new year will bring good tidings as I will have to redouble my efforts to remain on top in the ranking and hopefully make it to the top 10. I also hope this will motivate more Africans to aim high as nothing is impossible in the sport,” Aruna said. Nigeria’s Edem Offiong hit top 100 after gaining nine steps up the ranking as the third best female player in Africa.
