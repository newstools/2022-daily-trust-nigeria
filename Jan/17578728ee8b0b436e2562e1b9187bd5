Decomposing bodies dumped by kidnappers at an abandoned government hospital in Elele Alimini, a community in Emohua Local Government Area of the state have been discovered. The chairman of the council, Dr Chidi Lyold, made the shocking discovery on Thursday with a team of security personnel when he visited the community in search of those involved in illegal artisanal refinery activities in the area. Sources said the hospital was serving as a hideout for criminals operating in the area. Lyold, according to a statement by his press secretary, Bright Elendu, was amazed to discover decomposing bodies most of whom were suspected kidnapped victims. The statement said, “Irked by the number of already decaying corpses deposited inside a particular building in the hospital, the council chairman ordered the security personnel to search the entire hospital, during which the syndicate and illegal occupant of the hospital were apprehended in their hideout. “The council chairman also effected the arrest of some perpetrators of the illegal oil bunkering intercepted in course of the operation. “The council chairman and his team also effected the arrest of two drivers who were caught transporting illegally refined petroleum products at Rumuekpe junction along the East-West road,” the statement said. Lyold blamed the leaders of the community for allowing such evil activities to take place in their domain and vowed to prosecute those involved in the criminal activity. Efforts made to speak with the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Irene Koko, on the matter was not successful as she did not pick her calls or reply to the text message sent to her.
