Chief Kennedy Fintan Nnaji, President of Nigeria Union in Japan, has declared his intention to run for the presidency of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections. Chief Nnaji who doubles as the Patron of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Lagos chapter, made the declaration in a statement on Monday. The 53-year old businessman from Ikeduru LGA of Imo State said his decision to run for the exalted office was borne out of the need to bring his experiences in the diaspora to bear on Nigeria. “There are discordant voices among Nigerians fuelled by selfish persons. No country can grow in an atmosphere of disunity. Nigerians must see themselves as one for the country to move to greater heights. “I intend to come in to create harmonious relationship among Nigerians,” he said. On the party platform he would be contesting, he disclosed that it would be unveiled very soon. According to him, time has come for Nigerians to try fresh ideas from the diaspora for top political offices. He said he would not only bring his experiences into Nigeria but would unify the nation the way he unified all Nigerians resident in Japan, adding that, “My intention is to make Nigeria the best and safest nation that can compete with other nations of the world, where merit and accountability; not tribe, will be supreme.”
