Thugs yesterday attacked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Secretariat at Ajilosun area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, destroying doors, windows and other facilities. This is coming ahead of the June 18, 2022 governorship election in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Sunday Abutu, confirmed the attack, saying the command had drafted its men to the area to forestall any further breakdown of law and order. The PPRO noted that no suspect had been arrested, but investigation was on in a bid to arrest the perpetrators of the dastardly act. Meanwhile, a former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, in a statement yesterday condemned the attack and asked security agencies to arrest and prosecute the culprits.
