A cab driver, Egbede Japhet Onogwu from Benue State, has won a Kia Rio car in the final stage of the Glo Joy Unlimited Extravaganza promo. The 28-year-old is the 15th and last car winner in the promo, which ended yesterday. 25 televisions, 23 refrigerators, 25 generating sets were also won. Excited by the car gift, Japhet said he will continue with his cab work since he now has his own personal car. “I have been hiring a car for my cab business, which has made the business not so profitable, but with my own car now, the money, which I remit to the car owner on a weekly basis will go into my savings. Glo has really changed my life,” he rejoiced. Regional Manager, Sales at Victoria Island Gloworld, Olumide Oguntimehin, spoke on behalf of the Chairman, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jnr., at the final prize presentation event in the Glo Joy Unlimited Extravaganza promo. The Company had on October 28, 2021 unveiled the promo with a promise to give its subscribers across the country over 500,000 prizes including 15 brand new cars, thousands of household appliances such as fridges, television sets, generators as well as Glo freebies.
