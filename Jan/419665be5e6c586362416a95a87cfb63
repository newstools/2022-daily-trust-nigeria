 A rice company in Kano, Guarantee Impex, has urged the youth in the country to embrace the modern way of running businesses to remain sustainable and get more profits in their various enterprises. The Managing Director of the company, Muhammad Adamu Muhammad, made the call at an end-of-year award night organized by the company to motivate its staff and business partners that performed well in the year 2021. Muhammad said it was high time that the youth began to explore modern ways of running businesses by ensuring that they are registered and to document their activities no matter how small they are. According to him, their company has been in existence for over ten years, and that they have employed young people to mentor them into business and so far provided over 50 direct jobs and about 200 indirect jobs. “Our company is called ‘Home of the youth’ (Gidan Matasa). We got this name because right from me the CEO down to the messenger are all young people. So we employed this strategy considering the role that the youth play in the development of every sector of life. “So I want to be a role model to the youth so that they can be at the position I find myself in now. I urge the youth that whenever they want to venture into business or even existing ones, they should do it systematically and in conformity with the modern ways of running enterprises. This is what we are doing at Guarantee Impex and we are succeeding.” He said the essence of organising the Award Night was to encourage the staff towards the actualization of the company’s goals, as well as to serve as a challenge to others within and outside of their industry. The event was attended by leaders and members of the Kano Chamber of Commerce, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA), Bank Managers, representatives of Dala Inland Dry Port, and other business partners.
