The interim management of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) reached a truce with the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) and the Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies (SSAEAC), on Monday, after a protest on the sacking of General Managers (GMs) at AEDC. Daily Trust had exclusively reported the sack of the GMs through personal email messages, on Friday, in what was described as reform of the heavy-top positions of the DisCo. It was learnt that the unions from late Sunday shut down the AEDC network causing outages across the AEDC coverage area, which are FCT, Niger, Nasarawa and Kogi. They carried placards protesting the management action on Monday while the parties were later called for a meeting with the new management at the AEDC headquarters in Abuja. According to a Memorandum of Understanding between the new board representative of AEDC which took over the operations just recently, the Bureau of Public Enterprises, NUEE and the SSAEAC, the decisions include that “AEDC should recall the GMs to work with immediate effect and simultaneously, NUEE should ensure the restoration of power supply within the AEDC coverage area with immediate effect.” They agreed to have a two-week period for daily negotiations on the reform. “Both parties should commence negotiations daily at the AEDC headquarters starting from Wednesday “The negotiations on the way forward with respect to the GMs shall be concluded on or before 8 February,” read the pact signed by the AEDC Interim Managing Director, Bada Akinwumi; NUEE General Secretary, Joe Ajaero, and SSAEAC President, John Edjeba.
