The world’s first quantum-resistant messaging app, xx messenger, launched on the xx network on Tuesday. xx messenger allows users to communicate in real-time through hundreds of decentralized nodes operating worldwide, the company said in an emailed statement from Los Angeles. Blockchain-based xx messenger protects message content and metadata with unprecedented quantum resistance, thus giving users unparalleled shield to privacy. The app, available for download on IOS and Android, features group chat as well as photo and audio sharing, and is designed for easy use and switching from legacy messaging apps. “Unlike existing messaging apps, xx messenger uses quantum-resistant cryptography to protect message content from decoding and cMix software to obfuscate or shred metadata—information about who sends, when they send, where they send from, and who receive,” the company further explained. Randomly selected teams of xx nodes encrypt anonymity sets of 1,000 messages, which are then repeatedly shuffled and have also been encrypted using quantum-resistant cryptography. The distinguishing feature of this app is that information that links senders and receivers is destroyed, preventing third parties from tracking intimate details about the patterns and structure of our lives. What this means, in technical terms, is that the data cannot be subpoenaed or otherwise requested from the “xx network,” an analyst explained to Daily Trust. “So, in theory, any country that is threatened by this kind of digital sovereignty (and as David describes it: that is the idea that individuals should seamlessly and easily control their own keys and data) may well try to restrict the app. But again, because it is already running on a global decentralized network (instead of being run by a listed public company, headquartered in San Francisco, etc.), there is a stronger likelihood the app can continue to be accessible”.
