 The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued the Air Operators Certificate (AOC) to Xejet as airline operations intensify. The new premium airline, after the completion of the certification processes, received the document at the NCAA office at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. The director-general of the NCAA, Capt Musa Nuhu, said the authority was satisfied that the airline fulfilled the rigorous requirement. He said, “I must say that to go through this certification process is not an easy thing. I am aware that effectively, this process took almost one year. “Having gone through this process, we are elated and delighted because what that means is that you have brought yourself to compliance in conformity with our regulations. The issuance of this certificate means that you have complied with the requirements.” Capt Nuhu, who was represented by Godwin Balang, an engineer, the general manager, Air Operators Certification and Surveillance, emphasised that, “This is one of the critical elements of the activities we are required to do as an authority, which is certification. Now you are going to go into business. Immediately we give you this certificate, what we expect is that you keep to those standards.” The certification project manager, Capt Toyin Lawani, urged the new airline to put up a good operation going into business. “To maintain an AOC is not as easy as the acquisition because from the moment you receive the certificate, you are expected to keep improving on your operations and maintenance processes. We are guiding you at Xejet in order for you not to make mistakes in your operations. “You must try and become an exemplary company in the industry, so that even the NCAA will refer to you as a good example,” he said. The accountable manager and chief executive officer of Xejet, Mr Emmanuel Iza, who hinted that the journey started seven years ago, promised “to keep to safety and compliance to standards stipulated by the NCAA.
