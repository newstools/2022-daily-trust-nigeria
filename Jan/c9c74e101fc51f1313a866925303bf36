Kano State women have received assurance that they will continue to benefit from the ongoing $21.31 million (N8.8billion) 5-year Kano State Agro-Pastoral Development Project (KSADP) implementation through a loan facility from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). The facility includes a grant component from Live and Livelihood Funds (LLF). The fund is being invested in the development of the sustainable agro-production system in the state. The assurance was given by KSADP state Coordinator, Malam Ibrahim Garba when he received in his office, a coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) working with the Partnership for Advancing Women in Economic Development (PAWED) project aimed at promoting Women Economic empowerment in Kano state. According to him, most of the interventions that women will benefit from are either in the form of grants or are highly subsidised, adding that in situations where men are expected to provide counter-part funding or contribution of 50%, women will get 100% grant. “There are some interventions like animal fattening, milk production, rice milling in which women get free inputs or make little contributions while there are some interventions that both men and women get equal criteria,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the coalition, Hajiya Ai’sha Bello of development Research and Projects Centre (dRPC), stated that the coalition is so much concerned about advocating for a stronger and viable women economic development that will ensure women financial stability for a better society.
