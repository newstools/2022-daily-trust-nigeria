Some aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have shelved their plans to protest against the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni. The members, under the aegis of the APC Core Supporters’ Network, had last week issued a threat to shut down the national secretariat of the APC over alleged failure of the interim leadership of the party to organise a national convention. Daily Trust reports that the group consists of APC members who alongside many others had called for a substantive leadership of the party through the national convention amidst uncertainty over the date. In a statement yesterday by its national president, Maxwell Gowon, the group said its members were misled, misinformed and misguided by some disgruntled elements in the party. He said the group is now convinced that holding the party’s convention anytime in February without resolving the internal crisis in it would spell doom for the APC. “We call on all APC support groups, supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari and all progressives in the country to know that our earlier threat of protest against the committee is hereby withdrawn and suspended indefinitely,” the group said. Meanwhile, an association called the Patriotic Volunteers Association (PVA) has emerged within the Kano State chapter of the APC with the aim of contributing to the process of producing credible candidates ahead of 2023. Addressing newsmen yesterday, a former Kano State Commissioner, Alhaji Ibrahim Dan Azumi Gwarzo, said the group would help in entrenching democratic principles in the build up to the 2023 polls.
