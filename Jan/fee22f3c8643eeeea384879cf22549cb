The Kano State Police Command has intercepted 20 sacks of Indian hemp worth N3 million in separate operations in the state. The spokesman of the command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, disclosed this while parading the suspects arrested in connection with the seizure. He said on December 26, the command arrested one of the drivers carrying the Indian hemp along Naibawa-Zaria road, and the other driver was arrested in Brigade quarters, while they were about to make a delivery. “They were arrested by our men on duty on the said date around 3:00am. The first one was arrested along Naibawa while the other attempted to run and in the process he had an accident and we arrested him at Brigade quarters,” Kiyawa said. One of the suspects, who confessed to the crime, Surajo Balarabe, 23, of Rimin Kebe said the owner of the hemp fled when he realized they would be arrested. “I attempted to run when the police wanted to arrest us but we had an accident along the way. So the owner later fled and left me alone and I was arrested. I really regret this act, and I will not commit such again.” The second suspect who was driving a Honda Hennessey, Ahmad Ibrahim, 28, of Bachirawa quarters, said he didn’t know that the loaded item was Indian hemp. “I left home and someone said we should go to Naibawa Yanlemo to carry some goods. When we reached there, they loaded the sacks. I didn’t know that it was Indian hemp until they finished. I told him this is not good but he said we should hurry up and leave the place before anything happened. This is what happened.” Kiyawa however said investigation is still ongoing in the matter and that the suspects would be charged to court.
