The Federal Government has said unauthorised private jetties will not be allowed to operate in Nigeria as their illegal operations continue to deprive the government of revenues. The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi stated this in Abuja at the Presentation of a Compendium on Private Jetties in Nigeria by members of the Presidential Standing Committee on Private Jetties (PSCPJ). He directed that no private jetty should operate in the country without authorization from relevant government agencies, in a bid to shore up its revenue base and block leakages. Amaechi said: “we’ll see how we can summarise the report and present it to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to look at so that each Minister can have a copy.” The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Dr Magdalene Ajani stated: “I want to thank you so much for the hard work you have done to present this compendium but at the same time, I’ll like to request that you give us a copy of the executive summary because it would be impossible to take this report to FEC, so you will complete your job by giving us an executive summary”. Acting Chairman, Technical Sub-Committee, Presidential Standing Committee on Private Jetties and General Manager, Marine Services, National Inland Waterways (NIWA), Engr. Joseph Ororo, said this is the first time the activities and data resulting from the work of the Committee will be compiled since its inauguration 17 years ago. “This compilation encapsulates the standard operational procedure/guidelines for intending and existing jetty operators in the country”.
