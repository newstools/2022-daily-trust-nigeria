Aminu Bukar a three-year-old boy, who went missing in in Guri Local Government Area (LGA) of Jigawa State, last week, has been found dead. The Police Public Relations (PPRO) in the state, ASP Lawan Shiisu, confirmed this in a statement. He said Alhaji Bukar, the boy’s father, had earlier reported to the police that his child went missing at about 4:00 pm in Dolen Zugu Village on January 14, 2022. He said on the receipt of the report, a team of policemen swung into action and later discovered Aminu’s corpse at Tudun Mai Jambo bush, about one kilometers from the village. The PPRO said Aminu was rushed to the hospital and certified dead by a medical doctor. He said a police investigation concluded that there was no foul play in the boy’s death. Shiisu added that the corpse was later released to the relatives for burial. The development comes at a time when there is outrage over the abduction and murder of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old child in Kano. In the case of Hanifa, Abdulmalik Tanko, proprietor of the school she attended has confessed killing her with rat poison. He was arrested after collecting part of the N6 million ransom he demanded from the girl’s parents.
