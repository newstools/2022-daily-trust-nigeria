The National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (Retd), has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to address all logistics and operational challenges ahead of the 2023 general elections. Monguno gave the advice on Thursday in Abuja, at the first quarterly meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) for the year 2022. The NSA, who is also the co-chairman of ICCES said though the Anambra State governorship election was adjudged hitch-free, it was not without some logistics and operational challenges. He said the meeting was timely as it would enable members to brainstorm on how to address the identified challenges proactively. “This is very important given the fact that the 2023 general election is around the corner, the Area Council elections in the FCT holding on 12th February 2022 and two off-cycle elections in Ekiti and Osun States as well as other by-elections in the country,” Monguno represented by Sanusi Galadima said. He said all available security architecture of government would be mobilised to achieve a free, fair and credible poll in 2023. Speaking earlier, the INEC chairman and co-chairman of ICCES, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said, “Our responsibility is to protect the process to guarantee its integrity while leaving the outcome of the election for voters to determine.”
