A Chieftain of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Prince Ikechukwu Tabansi, has advised people not to expect much from the Anambra state Governor-Elect, Prof. Charles Soludo, in the first phase of his administration. Speaking to journalists at his country home on Monday, Nri kingdom in Anaocha Local Government Area of the state, Tabansi said it was unfortunate that a blossoming economy was allowed to deteriorate. “It’s true that we have a functioning brand new airport, but that should not compel the governor to neglect other projects just for a single project to stand.” “So, I don’t think we will expect much from Soludo in his first term because he has to struggle a lot to pay the workers among other responsibilities in the state. As I don’t expect much, I still believe that in the long run, Soludo is going to be among the greatest achievers recorded in the history of Anambra state. I x-rayed the whole candidates and discovered that Soludo is the better candidate in all put together and he has proven to be a good economic manager. “Even when he was the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, everybody witnessed his landmark achievements in the financial world. I believe that he is going to do well but he should be given enough space to prove his mettle. The Anambra state economy has been grounded since two years ago because Gov. Obiano overlooked his people. To buttress this point, take a look into our state motor parks. When I was in charge of parks in Onitsha, I was generating over N97million in every month. But for the past two years when the Governor’s wife took over the management of parks, they only realise less than N47million for the state government, where does the remaining go to?” he asked.
