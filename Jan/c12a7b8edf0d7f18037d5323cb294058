The League Management Company (LMC) has disclosed its plan to mete out punitive measures to Heartland, if by the end of today, the club fails to show proof that it had cleared the backlog of salaries owed players and coaches. In recent times, Heartland who are already neck-deep in relegation waters have been in the news for owing their players and coaches over 11 months salaries. In the ultimatum conveyed through an LMC memo, the embattled club has been ordered to produce evidence of payment latest today. “You will recall that you requested 14 days moratorium within which to settle your outstanding liabilities to players and officials salaries your club admitted owing and that the process is on-going to ensure settlement. The grace period has elapsed” “You are therefore to furnish us with the current position of the payments before close of work tomorrow, Friday, January 28, 2022 to enable us endorse to the relevant bodies for action. “Should we not receive any submission by the stated time, we would assume no payments have been made and we will take a decision in line with the NPFL Rule book and Club Licensing regulations”, ended the memo signed by Salihu Abubakar, the LMC Chief Operating Officer.
