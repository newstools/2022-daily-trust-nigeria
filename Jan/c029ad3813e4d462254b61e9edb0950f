Governor Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State has attributed sabotage to the fire outbreak in one of the mega schools his administration built in Muna, Jere Local Government Area of the state. President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned the school and other projects six months ago. During an on-the-spot assessment of the school, Zulum vowed to uncover the source of incident, saying there were strong indications that it was sabotage. “This school was commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari barely six months ago. Government has spent huge amount of money but unfortunately it has been razed. “Preliminary investigations shows that their is some level of sabotage because I see no reason why a school like this which has not been connected to national grid, no NEPA no generator… you just see fire at the last floor of the building.” Principal of the school, Saidu Umaru, said that the fire started around 7.30am on Monday, the first day of resumption. He said 19 classrooms and three laboratories were razed by the fire. “There are 59 classrooms in this school, there are 2500 students who were admitted into the school and yesterday (Monday) was the first day we opened the school since the president commissioned it,” Umar said
