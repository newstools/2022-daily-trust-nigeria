The Vice Chancellor of Bayero University, Kano Professor Sagir Abbas has launched a modern skills acquisition centre at the Students Affairs Deanery. The centre, according to the Vice Chancellor is to train students to learn tailoring and make-up in order to become self-reliant after graduation. He said if taken seriously, it would be a veritable source of revenue and job creation since government no longer provides adequate employment to the teeming youth. “Today is another significant milestone for me as the University is witnessing another gigantic stride to improve the welfare of students through skills acquisition platform. “This has come barely two months after the University launched a job scheme that employed 125 students to serve as part-time workers,” the Vice Chancellor stressed. He said, already, the students have started enjoying their wages, adding that based on assessment, they are working efficiently. The Dean, student affairs Shamsuddeen Umar expressed gratitude to the Vice Chancellor for initiating such laudable projects, noting that the VC’s penchant for welfare would forever be appreciated. He said the beneficiary students would learn tailoring, hair dress, make-up and head tie, saying that the idea is to expand the skills to many students. The Dean noted that many students from the Old Campus had earlier benefited with the skills acquisition programme conducted by the Deanery.
