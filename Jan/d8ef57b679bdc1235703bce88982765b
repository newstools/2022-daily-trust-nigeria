 The Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON) and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr. Osita Okechukwu, has said the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Reconciliation  Committee is positioning the party for 2023 electoral victory. The Adamu led Committee was set up recently by the Governor Mai Mala Buni led Caretaker Committee to resolve crises in all state chapters and prepare the party for a hitch-free convention, but there are reports that the Committee suffered setbacks in some APC states. Okechukwu, who spoke with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, said nobody expected the crisis dogging over 15 state chapters of the party to be resolved at once. “All I know is that the Senator Adamu’s Committee has so far recorded huge successes in the South East, North West, North East, South West and South South. “Yes, there are unresolved issues in states like Osun, Kwara and Adamawa, but my understanding is that reconciliation is a work in progress,” he said. Okechukwu, who was a member of the sub-committees in the merger process that formed the APC said the committee was generating germane responses and inputs that would help in strengthening the APC.
