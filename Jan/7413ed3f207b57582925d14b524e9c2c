Earlier today, a poster of former President Goodluck Jonathan, surfaced on the internet with the inscription ‘GEJ Is Coming Back’. The poster seems to have been facilitated by a group known as the National Agenda For Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. However, as the poster surfaced on social media, it elicited diverse opinions from Nigerians. For instance, commenting on the poster on an Instagram blog, mufasatundeednut, popular actress, Nkechi Blessing, stated that she would vote for Jonathan if he chooses to run. She simply commented, “I will over vote for him sef.” (sic) Also, another user, @popcorrnn._ wrote, “Yesss oh, he should please come back. He had a far better government than Buhari, & it took for him to go for us to realize it, he should please come back.” For @_james_oluwa, it is better to vote for Jonathan than any other candidate. He wrote, “It’s better to vote for him than any other candidate!! The Angel you know before is better than the one u just meet.” (sic) Having a contrary opinion, @icobenson believes that Jonathan would fail woefully, stating that we need a fresh start in the country. He said, “He will fail woefully, he didn’t maximize the opportunity given to him initially, so what does he have to offer this time absolutely NOTHING we need a fresh start. Soro Soke.” (sic) Also, @ay__july posted that the former president should not contest again. The Instagram user wrote, “We no still trust you again oo. You fit go do pass Bubu as payback. Let’s shine our eyes biko.” (sic)
