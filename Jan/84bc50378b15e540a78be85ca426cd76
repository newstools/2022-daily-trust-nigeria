The just concluded 2021 Jos international polo tournament has been lauded as a potent force that will continue to sustain peace and restore Plateau as the Home of Peace & Tourism in the country. Plateau State Governor, Barrister Simon Lalong who congratulated all the winners  and participants at the polo fiesta, lauded major sponsors like  NASCO Group and Malcomines  for their unalloyed support to the game of kings. Lalong, who was the Special Guest of Honour at the grand finale, told the crowd that apart from winning teams of the exciting tourney, the biggest highlight of the prestigious polo fiesta lies in its restoration of peace on the Plateau. The governor, who is also the Grand Patron of Jos Polo Club, reiterated his administration’s determination and willingness to invest more in the game of polo to encourage youth participation in the sport. “Polo brings together youth irrespective of tribe, religious and political differences, to interact together thereby fostering unity among the youths,” the governor stated in his closing remarks, before leading other dignitaries to present prizes to the winners and runners-up. Polo Royals can also report that apart from Malcomines that emerged the overall champions, other top winners of the eight day carnival include Abuja Dokaji who defeated three strong oppositions to lift the Imani Cup as well as Yola Yelwa who clinched the glittering NASCO Cup.
