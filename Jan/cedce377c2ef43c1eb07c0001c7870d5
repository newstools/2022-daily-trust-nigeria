…suspends nationwide planned mass action  The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), on Tuesday, asked the Federal Government to swing into immediate action in ensuring that all moribund refineries in the country are put back on their feet. The congress also maintained that the government should ensure that the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, comes down to an affordable level for Nigerians. Addressing journalists at Labour House in Abuja, President of NLC, Ayuba Wabba, also charged the President Buhari-led administration to rejuvenate all its policies and create sustainable jobs for Nigerian workers and other citizens. The organised labour’s formal position is coming less than 24 hours after the Federal Government, through the Minister of Finance, announced the suspension of its proposed plans to remove subsidy in June. Wabba, while speaking to journalists, explained that the National Executive Council (NEC) of the NLC, after vigorous debates, took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for Thursday. He noted that the affiliate unions and Civil Society Organisations who are its partners and have been fighting the causes of the masses have also been directed to also stay the action pending further directives. The labour leader said, ”The NEC, after vigorous debates, took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for 27th January 2022 and the national protest scheduled for 2nd February 2022. ”The leadership of the Congress has communicated this organ decision to our civil society allies who have stood stoically behind Nigerian workers in our quest for social and economic justice for workers and the downtrodden people of our country. ”Going forward, we will continue to engage with the government on the very critical issues of ensuring local refining of petroleum, creation of sustainable jobs and affordable price of petrol for Nigerian workers and people.”
