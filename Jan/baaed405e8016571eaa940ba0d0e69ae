The federal government has said it would conclude the ongoing registration of SIM cards and linkage with the National Identification Number (NIN) in the next two months. This was disclosed in Gombe at a stakeholders’ engagement programme for the Northeast sub-region organised by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) in collaboration with the Gombe State government. Speaking at the event, Dr Taofeeq Yekini of the Corporate Planning and Strategy (CPS) of NITDA, said the telecommunications companies are expected to conclude the registration of millions of their subscribers and complete the SIM/NIN linkage within the next two months. He said the stakeholders’ engagement programme was an avenue for the NITDA to interact with stakeholders in the North-East on the trends in communication and information technology in the country. The Director-General of NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, said the stakeholder’s forum was organised for the agency to listen and speak with people of the zone to get clarity on their perspectives, aspirations and needs.
