The Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said the federal government will work in synergy with Taraba State Government in advancing Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) in the state. Onu said this when the Taraba State governor, Architect Darius Dickson Ishaku, visited him in his office in Abuja. The minister said the FG was committed to helping the state to restore the affected facilities of Bio Technology Centre that was vandalized during the EndSARS protest. He also expressed Federal Government’s commitment to work very closely with the state government in order to reposition science and technology there. Onu added that the country was gradually moving from resource to knowledge-based economy through the efforts of the ministry by making sure that certain policies were put in place to achieve a common purpose. “We are gradually moving the nation away from depending on commodities, so that we can use our brain to add value to the enormous resources God has endowed to the nation’’, he said. He further said that for Nigeria to be truly great like other advanced countries, it must pay special attention to Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). Earlier, governor Ishaku said his visit to the ministry was to appeal to the federal government to resuscitate the vandalized Bio Technology Centre that was destroyed by hoodlums during the EndSARS protest. The governor said the BioTech centre if rebuilt, would improve the agricultural potentials of the state and provides jobs for its citizens.
