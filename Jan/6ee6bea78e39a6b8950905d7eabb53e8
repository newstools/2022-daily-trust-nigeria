A 38-year-old youth development advocate, Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has become the first female to declare interest in running for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. Okunnu-Lamidi, on Monday, declared her interest in replacing President Muhammadu Buhari at the helm of Nigeria’s affairs. Okunnu-Lamidi is the daughter of Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN), a former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, who is the President of Isale-Eko Descendants Union and an elder statesman while her mother, Arinola Omololu, is a businesswoman of Ago-Owu pedigree. Speaking at a media conference held at Freedom Park in Lagos, Okunnu-Lamidi, an active social impact practitioner who has carved a niche for herself in the Nigerian media and advertising space, disclosed that her motivation in vying for the presidency stems from her desire to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace.
