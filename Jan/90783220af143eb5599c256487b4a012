Edo Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shuaibu, has described Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, as the best candidate for the 2023 Presidency. Shuaibu, who was reelected alongside Governor Godwin Obaseki on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said the entire Edo is for the VP, who is of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Your Excellency, just know that you have Edo, you have us, anything that you want to do, you have us and you have God. And by the Grace of God, we will have our own as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023,” he said. Shuaibu made the declaration while speaking at the installation of the Minister of State for Budget & National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, as the Odumha of Auchi at the Otaru of Auchi Palace. The Vice President was the Special Guest of Honour at the occasion. Shuaibu thanked the VP for taking time from his busy schedule to be in Auchi, adding that “by the grace of God, the young men and youths, we will mobilise ourselves so that we can take our destiny in our hands. The EndSARS was a clarion call to all of us.” He then noted that “the era of God fathers are over, it is now the era of good leadership and progressive leadership. Men that have intellect, men that will turn our state into an industrial state so that those who are unemployed will be gainfully employed.”
