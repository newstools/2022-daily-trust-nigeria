The paramount traditional ruler of Tiv people worldwide, Tor Tiv, Prof James Ayatse, has said the Idoma nation appeared more focused to pick the ticket for the 2023 governorship election in Benue State. He made the remark when he received, Chief Patrick Ogbu, a gubernatorial aspirant of the Idoma ethnic stock on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at his palace in Gboko. The monarch recalled that before the immediate past Och’Idoma went on “permanent hunting expedition”, he had appealed to traditional rulers in the Tiv domain to prevail on Tiv sons to allow the Idoma people to have a shot at the governorship position. He however said it was not within the powers of the traditional rulers to make such a decision and advised the Idoma to continue to make their case with the political class because as royal fathers, they do not involve in politics. He also advised Ogbu that during his campaigns, he should dwell more on what he has to offer the people of the state, than on canvassing to be given the ticket based on tribal sentiments. Ayatse prayed divine favour to go with Chief Ogbu as he embarked on the campaign towards achieving his political aspiration.
