A cleric, Malam Muhammad Lawal Muhammad, has called on Muslims to always support Islamic schools in society. He made the call during the Qur’anic graduation ceremony of the Abubakar Sadiq Memorial Islamic Centre, Phase III quarters in Gwagwalada Area Council, Abuja, on Saturday. He said since Muslims want their children to acquire Islamic knowledge, there was the need for parents to give their support both financial and material-wise to such Islamic schools. “Mostly, Muslims always send their children to Islamic schools without taking care of such schools. If you observe, most of our schools are nothing to write home about, due to lack of attention to supporting such schools and their teachers,” he said. Muhammad, who was the chairman of the occasion, said teachers in Islamic schools are not like teachers in conventional schools which, he said, are always well paid, and appealed to parents to give their support to improving infrastructure in Islamic schools. Earlier, the headteacher of the school, Malam Hassan Idris, said the centre had in 2017 graduated 28 students after they had acquired the basic Qur’anic knowledge preparatory for the higher Qur’anic and Islamic discipline. He said a total of 30 students, comprised of 14 males and 16 females, successfully fulfilled the mandatory requirements for graduation in the centre. “And it may interest you to know that our teachers and some former students who have volunteered to teach go the extra mile to sacrifice their energy and their personal resources to impart knowledge to our wards,” he said. He, therefore, urged the graduands to see their graduation as a challenge and to rise to it with dedication in their studies.
