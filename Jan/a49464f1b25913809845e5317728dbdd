The former Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General Azubuike Ihejirika (rtd), says he is currently consulting for the Abia State gubernatorial race. At a media parley at his country home, Ovim, Isuikwato Local Government Area, Abia, on Wednesday, he said he joined politics because he wanted to make himself available to serve Abia and Nigeria. He said he joined the APC because he knows he can use its platform to achieve his mission and aspirations. Decrying the voting apathy witnessed over the years in Abia, Ijejiriaka called on Abians of voting age to get their voters cards and ensure that they vote massively for their preferred candidates during the 2023 governorship and presidential elections. Ihejirika said the time had come for Abia to jettison zoning and elect a quality candidate with proven integrity. “We have tried zoning and the question is how far did we go? We must get it right now so that we can move forward; we want a governor that can handle the problems of Abia. I urge every community to be prepared to bring out their best candidates, as Abia is number one in the country it should also reflect in our environment.” On his governorship ambition, Ihejirika said at the right time, he would make his mind known to the people. He further said he was also available to also serve the country in any capacity. Speaking on the activities of Boko Haram, Ihejirika said he did his best but further commended those after him in the fight against insurgency.
