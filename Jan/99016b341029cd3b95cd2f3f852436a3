SC Freiburg are punching above their weight in the Bundesliga this season, with Christian Streich’s ambitious underdogs from the heart of the picturesque Black Forest eyeing a first appearance in the Champions League. Freiburg have been perennial mid-table finishers in recent Bundesliga seasons, aside from their relegation in 2014-15 before coming straight back up. Streich is the Bundesliga’s longest-serving current coach after more than a decade in the job. Under his stewardship, Freiburg’s performances have fuelled dreams of a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League for the first time. “If that should happen, I think the party would really kick off in the city,” club captain Christian Guenter told AFP. “It’s never happened before in the club’s history, but there is still a really long way to go.” It’s 08:45am local time on a bleak morning, yet Guenter, 28, is fresh-faced and ready for training, clearly enjoying his football. His performances at left-back earned him a Germany recall last November, seven years after his international debut. Freiburg usually struggle to keep their best players, most recently when Germany defender Robin Koch left in 2020 to join Leeds United. “Almost 10 years ago, we qualified for the Europa League and five important players left that summer,” sporting director Klemens Hartenbach told AFP. “It’s always a bit related to sporting success — the exodus after the good work.”
