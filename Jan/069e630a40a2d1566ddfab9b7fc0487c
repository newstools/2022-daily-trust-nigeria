The Head Project Delivery Office of the federal government’s MSMEs Survival Fund Scheme, Mr Tola Johnson, has said the government is not disbursing 80,000 survival fund. In a statement issued by the office yesterday, Johnson said the attention of the Project Delivery Office was drawn to a scam being perpetrated by fraudsters to steal from unsuspecting members of the public under the guise of the MSME Survival Fund Scheme. “It is pertinent for the public to note that all tracks of the Survival Fund Scheme have closed, but even the initial verification process did not require beneficiaries dropping their account details to individuals as is being demanded by fraudsters in the ongoing scam. “The public is hereby notified that requests circulated via social media and SMS for people to disclose their account details to benefit from the Survival Fund Scheme is a scam, hence members of the public should disregard such requests,” Johnson said. He further stated that the steering committee of the federal government’s Survival Fund headed by the Minister of State, Industry, Trade and Investment, Amb. Maryam Y. Katagum, has contacted relevant law enforcement agencies to track and bring to justice all persons involved in the scam.
