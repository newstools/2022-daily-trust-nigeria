A former governor of Kebbi State and  factional leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Senator Adamu Aliero, has said political calamity awaits the party in the state, for alleged lack of fairness and justice. Crisis had erupted in the state chapter of the party at the beginning of the new year following struggle by party bigwigs to control its structure in the state. The lawmaker, who spoke yesterday in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital, said APC would be doomed in the state if it failed to treat all members with fairness and justice, adding that imposition of leaders in the party was unacceptable. He said his faction had opened an office in the state capital, and implored all party faithful to open one at their local government headquarters as well as the ward level. “There would be severe consequences if APC in Kebbi State fails to be fair to all. During the last congress of the party, some members were selfishly removed as leaders while others were imposed to take over their positions. “We will not allow that to be and it will remain unacceptable,” the senator said. Contacted, the state chairman of the party, Abubakar Kana Zuru, said there was no imposition in the party, adding that all the current party officials were duly elected.
