The presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday received a boost with the endorsement of his aspiration by Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello. Speaking when he received Tinubu at the Niger State government house, the governor described the former Lagos State governor as a candidate to reckon with. He said he looked forward to seeing him lay the kind of foundation he laid for the massive transformation in Lagos State for the country. “We saw the foundation you laid in Lagos and we look forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria,” he said. Tinubu donated N50 million to the victims of bandits attacks in the state. He said he believed the current insecurity facing the country would be addressed if effort was intensified. “We share in your grief; I’m here for the people of Niger State. I have heard and read of the disasters, banditry and cattle rustling every day, just like what happened on Wednesday again,” he said. Why I met Babangida – Asiwaju Tinubu also met with former military president General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd) behind closed doors. But in an interview with journalists, he said his visit to the former leader was to seek blessing. “Generally, I came to Niger State to commiserate with the governor and the people of the state. And so, I can’t stop by without paying a courtesy call to the enigma, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. “So, he gave me his prayers. You want to know the outcome of the consultation? We are running a democracy. I took my decision voluntarily and I am running for the presidency of the country; we are running a democracy”. “When I made the declaration, I told you that I am still consulting and I will consult as widely as possible,” he also said.
