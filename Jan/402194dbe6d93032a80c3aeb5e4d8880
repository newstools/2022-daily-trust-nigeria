 The Kano Dambe team under Mazaje Traditional Sports Promotion Limited have defeated their counterparts from Nasarawa state in a Dambe Fight Night organised by African Warriors Championship in collaboration with SWA Sports in Abuja over the weekend. The team under the tutelage of Nura Muhammed Sulaiman went home with a cash prize of N250, 000 after emerging winner in the 10-round of intense Dambe fights whilst Nasarawa team got a sum of N150, 000 having emerged runners up in the contest. Announcing the results, the referee of the game declared that Kano got 24 points with eight-win, having lost in two rounds to Nasarawa that won only two in all the rounds. According to Maxwell Kalu, the founder and CEO of the African Warriors Championship, Dambe fight was selected because it encompasses the culture and traditions of the people at the grassroots. “And we wanted to bring it to the city for people that may be interested in seeing that kind of action and a unique sport. We just wanted to offer something different that people are not used to,’’ he said Kalu also said, though for now Abuja and Lagos are their focus and it’s the first event of its kind but they intend to roll out more events during 2022 and beyond. “And we definitely have plans to carry the Fight Night brand to other parts of the country but you know everything has to be gradual and done properly. So, this is just the beginning for us,” he stated
