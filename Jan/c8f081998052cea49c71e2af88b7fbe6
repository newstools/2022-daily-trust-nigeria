President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the Super Eagles of Nigeria for an impressive and inspiring start at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. The three-time African champions edged seven-time winners Egypt 1-0 in the opening match of Group B on Tuesday. The President, in a statement issued Wednesday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said like millions of football-loving Nigerians, the spectacular outing in Garoua, Cameroon was a foretaste of what to expect from the dedicated team as they squared up against other opponents in the tournament. President Buhari urged the Augustine Eguavoen-led team and the coaching staff to keep their eyes on the ball, remain good ambassadors on and off the field, give loyal fans and all Nigerians more exciting moments to celebrate. The President assured the team of his unflinching support as they soared like an eagle to write another chapter in the annals of Nigeria’s rich football history. Meanwhile, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has also congratulated the team on the convincing win over the Pharaohs of Egypt. Lanre Lasisi, media aide to the Speaker, in a statement yesterday said Gbajabiamila was elated that the Super Eagles put up a superlative performance to defeat the Pharaohs of Egypt, who are considered one of the favourites of the tournament. The Speaker, who is the leader of the federal government’s delegation to cheer up the Super Eagles, noted with delight the team spirit among the Eagles players. Gbajabiamila, therefore, urged the Super Eagles to maintain the same spirit and tempo throughout the tournament so that they would come back home with the trophy.
