A former governor of Osun State and current Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, was yesterday absent when the National Reconciliation Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) visited the state. The reconciliation committee led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, only met with the Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and leaders of The Osun Progressive caucus of the party led by Hon. Rasaq Salinsile, who are loyal to the minister. Speaking after the meeting, Adamu expressed optimism that the crisis in the state chapter of the party would be resolved. The committee first met with Oyetola at the government house. The governor assured them of absolute cooperation. The secretary, State Congress Committee, Mr. Sunday Akere, said in a statement last night that the allegation of alienation of party leaders by the Aregbesola group was false.
