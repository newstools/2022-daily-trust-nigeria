A former Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Mohammed Dauda, has written to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, asking him to halt plots to arrest him. The letter copied the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), the Department of State Service (DSS) and the Inspector General of Police. Dauda, who was dismissed on March 6, 2018, had obtained a judgment of the National Industrial Court nullifying his dismissal. The NIA had appealed the judgment. In a letter dated January 8, 2022, counsel to Dauda, Kanu Agabi (SAN) informed Malami that the media space had been awash with fresh moves to arrest his client while the matter was in court. Agabi said the suit was pending, the NIA filed an appeal against the court’s interlocutory decision refusing its application to dismiss the suit together with the organisation’s substantive appeal which are all before the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division. Agabi noted that the pending appeals does not serve as a stay of execution on the judgment earlier delivered by the court. “We hereby appeal that the Honourable Attorney-General sees to it that the sanctity of the pending judicial processes is not compromised by the National Intelligence Agency acting either by itself or through any of its sister agencies by arresting, attempting to arrest or by whatsoever means compromising the personal liberty of our client on account of their appeals or matters connected thereto,” he wrote in the letter.
