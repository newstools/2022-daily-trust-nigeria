Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are currently grilling a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr Olasupo Shasore, (SAN). An impeccable source at the commission told Daily Trust that the senior lawyer arrived the headquarters of the anti-graft agency on Tuesday afternoon. The source said he is being quizzed over his role in the Process & Industrial Development scam. “Yes, Mr Shasore and other prominent Nigerians played key roles in that P&ID scam. Each of them is being quizzed one after the other by the commission. Though, only Mr Shasore is here today to answer some questions,” the source said. Spokesman of the commission, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the development to our correspondent but declined further comments. Daily Trust recalls that EFCC on October 18 last year re-arraigned two British nationals over their alleged involvement in the controversial gas processing contract. The contract led to the $9.6bn arbitral award to P&ID Limited by a United Kingdom commercial court. James Nolan and Adam Quinn were arraigned alongside ICIL Limited before a judge, D.U. Okorowo, of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Nolan pleaded not guilty to the 32 counts including money laundering and tax evasion. Quinn, who was said to be at large, was re-arraigned in absentia, with “not guilty” plea recorded for him and the judge. Similarly, a “not guilty” plea” was recorded for the company.
