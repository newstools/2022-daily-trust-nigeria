Three-time champions, the Super Eagles of Nigeria yesterday reached the Round of 16 at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations after goals by Samuel Chukwueze, Taiwo Awoniyi and Moses Simon condemned Sudan’s Falcons of Jediane to a 3-1 defeat at the Stade Roumdé Adjia in Garoua. The Eagles had won eight of 14 previous clashes with the Sudanese, which included four draws, and they started with that air of superiority as former U17 World Cup winner Chukwueze rolled the ball elegantly past goalkeeper Ali Abdalla Aboeshren in the second minute to record the fastest goal of the competition so far. Unperturbed by the early setback, the pressed for equaliser as they showed some delightful passing game, possession football, competence in launching fast counter-attacks and also hinting at some ambition. However, the Super Eagles remained steadfast with right back Olaoluwa Aina characteristically joining the attack when it appeared safe and Wilfred Ndidi and Joe Aribo working hard to keep things moving in the middle. Before Awoniyi found the net for Nigeria’s second goal in the 45th minute, Nigerians thought their team had scored a second in the 36th minute when Chukwueze and Iheanacho combined on the right side of the field and got the ball past Aboeshren, only for the ball to miraculously head out of the net in a hazy melee. Simon, who dazzled to no end against the Pharaohs switched to a higher gear at the beginning of the second half and was assisted by Awoniyi, who chested down a short lob to free the France –based forward for a close encounter with Aboeshren that the goalkeeper emerged the loser, as he had to pick the ball from his net. In the 70th minute, South African referee Victor Miguel Gomes awarded a penalty to the Falcons, which was converted by substitute Mohamed Hussein. Super Eagles final group match will be on Wednesday against debutants the Wild Dogs of Guinea Bissau.
