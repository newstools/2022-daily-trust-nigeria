Boko Haram fighters have been killed in Maina-Hari, Biu Local Government Area of Borno State. A source told Daily Trust that troops of Operations Hadin Kai gunned down the insurgents who attempted to attack the largest town in the Southern part of Borno, on Saturday. Speaking about the incident, Haruna Aliyu, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), said the insurgents came with six-gun trucks. He said only few of them escaped as soldiers and local guards descended on them heavily. “We overpowered the outlawed group under 45 minutes. It was the best outing in recent times. We killed more than 40 Boko Haram members today,” the CJTF member,  said. The incident comes after the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) showed footage of its men attacking the army institute in Biu. The insurgents, who shot sporadically, pulled down some flags and set vehicles on fire. Two persons were reportedly killed in the attack which happened on Monday. The army authorities are yet to comment on the attack.
