Globacom has said it sponsored the annual festival of the Benin Great GSM Village for the second consecutive year because small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria are the backbone of the economy. Daily Trust reports that the sponsorship is in line with a previously signed Memorandum of Understanding between the company and the Benin Great GSM Village association that spans a five-year period. The Great GSM Village is the only recognised and registered association in Benin City, Edo State, housing the full complement of ICT professionals empowered to train technicians in the repair of GSM products and the sale of the devices. Globacom’s Head of Business,  Mid-West, Mr Augustus-Ndu Offor, who spoke at the carnival, said Globacom had always been in support of small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria since they are the backbone of viable economies.
