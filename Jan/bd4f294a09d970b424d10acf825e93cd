Nigeria’s dream of winning a fourth continental title ended yesterday when the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia defeated the Super Eagles by a lone goal at the Stade Roumde Adjia in Garoua. Nigeria had dominated the early proceedings of the game to keep the Tunisians in their own half without any result. In the 10th minute, the Carthage Eagles came close to the Super Eagles penalty box but their threats were snuffed out by the ever vigilant defence. Awakened by that threat, the Super Eagles in quick succession had their fourth corner kicks but were unable to convert any of them. In the 22nd minute, Kelechi Iheanacho was booked for a cynical foul while trying to prevent a counter attack by the Tunisians. Moses Simon who arguably has been Nigeria’s best player was unable to cause the expected damage as the Tunisians had at least three players on him whenever he was with the ball. As the first half gradually wore on, the Carthage Eagles began to attack the Super Eagles with more intensity  but  failed to take their chances with the match ending 0-0 at half time. Four minutes into the second half, the Tunisians stunned the Super Eagles when Youssef Msakni opened the scoring with a long distance strike beyond the reach of Okoye Maduka. Seeking to get back into the game, Augustine Eguavoen made a double substitution taking off Iheanacho and Taiwo Awoniyi for Peter Olayinka and Alex Iwobi who was red carded in the 66th minute for dangerous play. The Super Eagles who were favourites to win the tournament poured out in numbers and came close on few occasions to no avail. The Tunisians sensing a famous victory deployed delay tactics in a bid to frustrate the Nigerians who were inconsolable at the blast of the final whistle.
