The federal government has realized the sum of N8.6trn as taxes for the year 2021. Data released by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) disclosed that both agencies generated N2.2 trillion and N6.4 trillion respectively. The Executive Chairman, FIRS, Muhammad Nami, gave the figure in Abuja at a public presentation and breakdown of highlights of the 2022 Appropriation Act. Nami said: “We collected more than 70 per cent of the target set for 2021 with the help of technology and I assure Nigeria that we will do better in 2022. “The figures will be fully published soon.’’ The NCS said the N2.2 trillion it generated at the end of 2021, surpassed the target of N1.6trn it set for the year. A statement by the Service Public Relations Officer, Comptroller Joseph O. Attah yesterday, showed that the amount generated was a 43 per cent increase of the N1.5trn generated in 2020. Attah also disclosed that the service’s efforts to prevent the entry of items that could compromise the security of citizens, economy and the well-being of the people resulted in the seizures of 5,096 assorted items with a duty paid value of N13.7billion and 160 suspects at different levels of investigation or prosecution. The Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd) attributed the feat to “resolute pursuit of what is right and willingness to adapt to changes brought about by global health challenges occasioned by covid-19.” He expressed delight that the service revenue generation profile had continued to be on the rise annually.
