The Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has said though he is ready for campaign and capable of leading the country, he is not desperate to become president. Kalu, also a former governor of Abia State, stated this Wednesday while fielding questions from journalists at the National Assembly, a day after he visited President Buhari at the Presidential Villa. According to him, the presidential contest would be the collective decision of Nigerians and the zoning arrangement of the political parties, particularly his ruling All Progressives Congress. He, however, said the South East region was overdue to produce the next president. Kalu disclosed that his discussions with Buhari centred on national issues, especially security, electoral laws and the welfare of the country. When asked if he informed the president of his presidential ambition, he said, “I have said before that there are only two zones that have not been president. The South East and the North East. Once the ticket is zoned to the South East, I have the capacity and the capability to lead. I will roll out my campaign and rock like a hurricane. “It’s overdue for an Igboman to become a Nigerian president. I believe the South East should produce the next president and it’s going to happen.” Kalu added that he would commence nationwide consultations at the right time.
