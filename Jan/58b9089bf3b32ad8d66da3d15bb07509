The internal wrangling rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has assumed a new twist with the three factions of the party bickering over the sponsoring of political thugs in the state. The faction of the former governor Abdulaziz Yari faction had expressed fear that the state is being turned into a political “theatre of war” where thugs are calling the shots. Chairman of the faction, Lawal M. Liman, who made the assertion, disclosed that the recent attack on the chairman of the Social Media Forum of Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa faction of the APC, Malam Shamsu Shehu, by political thugs around Government House, Gusau in broad daylight should be a source of concern to all peace-loving and law-abiding citizens of the state. Similarly, Senator Kabiru Marafa’s camp has condemned the attack and urged security agencies to fish out the culprits otherwise they would be forced to take necessary action. The publicity secretary of the Marafa faction, Bello Bakyasuwa, in a statement said they would not sit back and watch their members being harassed. However, in their reaction, Matawalle’s camp, through their publicity secretary, Yusuf Idris Gusau, said the allegations were baseless and levelled by those who have lost relevance in Zamfara politics.
