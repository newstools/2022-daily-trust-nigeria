Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State yesterday paid a condolence visit to a factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Alhaji Ahmadu Haruna Danzago, over the death of his elder brother, Alhaji Shuaibu Haruna Zago. Ganduje was in the company of the Chairman of his APC faction in the state, Abdullahi Abbas and other members of his entourage. Danzago, who lost his brother in the late hours of Saturday in Kano, is chairman of the APC faction loyal to a former Governor of the state, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau. Ganduje and his entourage visited the chairman of the Shekarau’s camp of the APC at his residence in the Kurna area of Dala Local Government of the state. Shekarau and Ganduje, are at daggers drawn over the control of party structure in the Kano State. Recall that there have been divisions in the state chapter of the APC since after the state congress, which produced two factional chairmen.
