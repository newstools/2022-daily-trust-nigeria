The State Commissioner of police, Abdu Umaru, who addressed newsmen in Maiduguri, on Friday, said there was an attempt by the insurgents to invade the training school but officers repelled it. “No police personnel were abducted at the police mobile training college Gwoza. Yes, there was an attempt to invade the school, we wish to inform the general public that the insurgents, who attacked the mobile training school on the 13th of January, 2022 at 2022hrs were successfully repelled by our gallant and men with less effort. “The police did not record any single casualty not loss of firearms and no casualty on the part of police was recorded.” CP Umaru said. “The Command wishes to categorically debunk the news, consider it as fake news.. On this note, I am using this medium to call the attention of the general public to disregard any misleading information that may likely cause panic and disturb the peace of innocent citizens who are roaming endlessly in search of a greener pasture, and to assure them of our commitment, focus and determination toward bringing an end to the insurgency and other crimes and criminality in Borno State.”
