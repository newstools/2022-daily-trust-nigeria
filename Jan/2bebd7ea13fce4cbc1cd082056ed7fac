Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has directed his appointees nursing political ambition ahead of the 2023 elections to resign in order not to be distracted. Speaking during the State Executive Council meeting at the government house in Yenagoa, on Wednesday, Governor Diri said such ambition was legitimate but should not be at the expense of effective service delivery of his administration. According to him, though 2022 is a political year, governance will not be sacrificed on the altar of politics. He noted that the administration still has time to deliver on its promises before the next governorship election in late 2023 but that cabinet members eyeing other elective offices in the polls in February or March next year must not combine politics with governance. He stressed that the development of the state should supersede politics.
