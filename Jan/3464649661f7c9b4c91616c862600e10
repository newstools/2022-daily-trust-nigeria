Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof. Charles Soludo, has denied the allegations that Governor Willie Obiano gave him conditions which he accepted before supporting him to become governor of the state. According to Soludo, Obiano has not discussed any condition with him, during and after the primary or the governorship election. The governor-elect made the clarification on Sunday, during a thank you visit to Governor Obiano at his country home in Aguleri, Anambra East Local Government Area. “Governor Obiano’s interest is to project Anambra high. “His obsession is to ensure that I continue with the good works he has done in the state. “My deputy and I will work hard, every minute of the day to make him proud and make Anambra proud too. “I say thank you a billion times for your support. There would have been a dozen and one reason to walk away from me, but you were resolute. Your expectations to make Anambra proud must be met. “Some believed that APGA would die this administration, but God intervened,” Soludo said. Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor, who joined Soludo on the thank-you-visit, charged Prof. Soludo to ensure that he sustain the tempo of development in the state and continue with the legacies of the Obiano administration. Bishop Ezeokafor called for maximum collaboration between the outgoing administration and the incoming one. Wife of a former Vice President, Dr. Ifeoma Ekwueme, thanked God for the victory of APGA, irrespective of the turmoil that the opposition planned to distort the election. National Vice President of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Okeke Ogene, said the election and victory of Prof. Soludo had raised the pride of the Igbo people globally.
