A former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani (PDP, Enugu) has said that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has the political clout to produce his successor without challenges. Nnamani stated that this is a tradition practised by previous governors of the state since 1999 and there won’t be a brick wall for him to achieve it. In a statement, he said “We have a tradition in Enugu State politics. The governor is the leader who directs affairs. He will determine who succeeds him without compromising the electoral processes and whomever he chooses will be our next governor. “I have absolute loyalty and respect for my governor who is also the leader of the Ebeano political family. He has demonstrated capacity and leadership. We are waiting for him to lead the way to go in 2023 and we shall follow”. Senator Nnamani from Enugu East was the state governor from 1999 to 2007, Sullivan Chime from Enugu West took over from 2007 to 2015 while the incumbent Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi from Enugu North is expected to complete the cycle in 2023. It is expected that the governorship slot returns to Enugu East for the second round of the rotation in 2023. He said he was excited by the political developments in the state where accomplished sons and daughters are showing interest in the politics of the state and prayed that the best amongst them emerges as governor in 2023.
