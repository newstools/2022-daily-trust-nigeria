Three days after Governor Sani Bello endorsed his presidential bid, National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has visited the Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Senator Sani Musa (APC Niger). The lawmaker is one of the top contenders of the APC national chairmanship. The former Lagos State governor who visited Senator Musa at his Maitama residence in Abuja, assured him that the contribution he has made to the party would not be in vain. Tinubu said Senator Musa would be rewarded by the party following his contributions to the success of the party in 2014 and 2015. He said, “The sacrifices of distinguished Senator Mohammed Sani Musa in 2014/2015 will not go in vain, The leadership of the ruling party is fully aware. Insha Allah, he will be rewarded.” When Tinubu visited Niger governor on Thursday, Bello had said if the APC Tinubu could transform Lagos, he could do the same in Nigeria. The governor said, “We saw the foundation you laid in Lagos and we look forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria.” During his visit, Tinubu donated N50m to the victims of bandit attacks in the State. He further stated that he believed the current security challenges facing the country would be addressed if efforts were intensified.
