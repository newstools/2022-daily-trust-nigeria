Members of the National Coalition Group (NCG) on Wednesday visited the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, to seek his support for the presidential ambition of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. NCG’s National Secretary Dr Eli Dibia, who sought the emir’s royal blessing for the vice president, added that he remained the best choice for the country. “Osinbajo remains the best presidential candidate that the All Progressives Congress (APC) can field come 2023. “Doing otherwise may be disastrous for the party and APC may lose the election. Our research has shown that the only person the opposition is afraid of is Osinbajo. “So we are in Ilorin to seek the emir’s support for the vice president and to help canvas for a president for all Nigerians who will sustain and build on the legacies of President Buhari,” he noted. In his response, the emir prayed to God to grant the country a peaceful transition in 2023. He thanked the team for the visit adding ‘I wish you well in your programmes.
