Ivorian giants, Asec Mimosa are on the verge of signing the immensely talented Nigerian young striker, Christopher Tavershima Shimbayev, who plays for Chinese club Nanjing City FC. The former African champions are said to be willing to dole out a whopping N50m on the player whose style of play is likened to that of Nantes of France and Super Eagles attacking winger, Moses Simon. After he was signed by Nanjing City FC, Shimbayev had loan spells at Shaanxi Ch’angan Athletic and Suzhou Dongwo FC where he proved his mettle as a striker. However, Daily Trust learnt that the COVID-19 crisis which hit China and the rest of the world has made it difficult for Nanjing FC to meet the asking sum of 100,000 US Dollars or 633,000 Rmb for the services of the young striker. Consequently, Mr. Austin Akpehe, the Executive Chairman of Galaxy Sports Academy from where Shimbayev was transferred to the Chinese club has disclosed that the player will be sold to the highest bidder. He said “Galaxy Sports Academy is ready to sell Shimbayev to ASEC Mimosa of Cote d’Ivoire or Esperance of Tunisia. Both clubs have indicated interest in the highly gifted player. They want to buy at the asking price which in all honesty is meagre and affordable. “Galaxy understands the precarious financial condition of Nanjing FC but this is professional football. This is about business so we cannot allow sentiments to override our collective interest. “So we are weighing the options before us. We are also waiting to see which club will meet this offer which the Chinese club is struggling with,” said Akpehe.
