A former Social Democratic Party presidential aspirant, Chief Reuben Famuyibo, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) saying he will contest the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State under the platform of Accord Party as third force. Famuyibo said his decision to dump the ruling APC and pursue his ambition in Accord was borne out of the desire of the people and stakeholders within and outside the state for him to be on the ballot. The former APC governorship aspirant, who spoke with newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, accused the leadership of the ruling party of not providing a level playing field for all aspirants which, he said, necessitated the call by his admirers and supporters to pursue his aspiration on another platform. The Ado-Ekiti-born politician said processes leading to the primary of the APC have been skewed in favour of the alleged anointed aspirant of the governor, noting that “it will be unwise to go ahead with that situation looking at our plans for the state.”
