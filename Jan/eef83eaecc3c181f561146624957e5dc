An aspirant for the office of National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Blessing Agbomhere, has said only competent aspirants should be elected at the February 26, 2022, national convention of the party. Agbomhere, a former governorship aspirant in Edo State told newsmen yesterday in Abuja, that only a new crop of competent National Working Committee (NWC) can deliver the party beyond 2023. Agbomhere, who had also contested the APC ticket for the House of Representatives said if given the mandate to administer the affairs of the youths in the party, he would mobilise 30 million youths ahead of the 2023 polls. “Today, Nigeria is where it is because the young minds and intellectual minds are not involved in the governance of our nation. Policies and programmes are made and added wars as a muse. “Now, we don’t want that anymore. We want to now be involved in making policies and programmes that will dictate or determine the governance of this nation,” he said.
