The Joint Admission and Matriculations Board (JAMB) has set April 20, 2022, for the commencement of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). JAMB said the mock examination would hold on April 2, 2022, while registration for the examination would commence from February 12 and end on March 19, 2022. This was contained in a weekly bulletin released by JAMB’s Director of Media and Public Relations, Fabian Benjamin, on Monday. Benjamin said the board also resolved to refund the N4,000 fee to each candidate that was unsuccessful in completing the registration process for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination and Direct Entry Examinations. The bulletin read in part, “This is to notify all 2021 candidates who had deposited a draft of four thousand naira (N4,000) for late registration for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination and Direct Entry but were unable to complete the registration process, owing to no fault of the Board, even after the Board had extended the registration period twice. “The above candidates are to click on the link 2021 UTME/DE Unregistered Candidates Bank Draft Recapture and fill the spaces, after which they would key in the token sent to the phone numbers they had submitted during the submission of their drafts. It is this token that would be used to access a form on which they will fill in their account details for the refund of the value of the draft. Candidates are to provide these details within the next two weeks from the date of this publication. “A text message containing OTP has been sent to the affected candidates besides this notification.”
