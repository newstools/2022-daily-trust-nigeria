The secretary of the Area Council Services Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar Dantsoho, has disclosed that over 70 per cent of the secretariat’s 2022 capital budget will be committed to executing projects and improving infrastructural development in rural communities. Dantsoho disclosed this during his familiarisation visit to the chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, in his office yesterday. He noted that the provision of basic infrastructure was key towards improving the living standard of people at the grassroots, even as he called for synergy among the area council chairmen with the ACSS to achieve the target of building vibrant area councils that the residents would be proud of. He said improving synergy with the area councils will encourage the secretariat to build on its achievements in the areas councils, “such as the renovation of the chief of Yaba Palace, award of contract for the construction of a double-cell box culvert along Achido-Naharati road in Abaji.” Responding, the chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, commended the FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello and minister of state, Hajiya Ramatu Tijani Aliyu, for their support, especially in the provision of pipe-borne water as well as the end of year palliatives for the people of Abaji. Ajiya, while speaking on the security situation in the area, informed the mandate secretary that the council has been collaborating with DSS, vigilante and the police to stem criminality in the area. He solicited the support of FCTA to sustain security and the progress made so far in tackling kidnapping and other crimes in the area.
