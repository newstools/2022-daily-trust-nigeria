Bayelsa State task force on the implementation and enforcement of the anti-open grazing law has impounded 44 cows in Yenagoa, the state capital for roaming around the restricted areas. The committee, led by the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr David Alagoa, in the company of security operatives, impounded the cows from the readers. Daily Trust gathered that the herders and owners of the cows were not arrested alongside the cows. Last month, the state’s livestock management committee had charged three herders for violating the state’s anti-open grazing law. Farmers in Bayelsa State have lamented the destruction of their farmlands by cattle, urging the state government to ensure that the anti-open grazing law is totally enforced to avoid conflicts. Recently, some farmers along the Tombia-Amassoma Road axis in Okutukutu community of Yenagoa, while counting their losses due to the destruction of their farms by cattle, said the invasion of their farmlands by herders was affecting their incomes.
