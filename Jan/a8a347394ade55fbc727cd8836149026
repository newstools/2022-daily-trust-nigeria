A member of the House of Representatives, Babangida Ibrahim (APC, Katsina), yesterday, explained why the House differed with the Senate on the new electoral bill. He told our reporter that the House reverted and adopted the earlier position of the committee’s report presented earlier to the parliament. “The consideration done was for the original committee’s report. People don’t understand. It was the original committee position. So, the amendment which recommended direct primaries was brought by the Speaker during the consideration of the report last year. “The changes were made during the consideration of the report and insisted on direct primaries. What the House did now is we simply went back to the committee’s report,” he said. The lawmaker said the House rejected consensus because it gave room for imposition of candidates. “Consensus was done away with because it was an issue. It gives some people an advantage to work against the wish of the people, because, when you say consensus, who organises consensus?,” he said. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has passed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill through third reading on Thursday.
