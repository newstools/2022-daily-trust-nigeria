The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, four former governors and members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) have arrived former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s residence in Abeokuta, Ogun State. The team arrived the Pent House residence of the former President located within his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Oke Mosan, Abeokuta, at about 12:25pm. In the team are, the PDP Vice Presidential candidate in 2019 election, Peter Obi, former Governors, Sule Lamido (Jigawa), Olusegun Mimiko (Ondo), Liyel Imoke (Cross River) and Donald Duke (Cross River). The Deputy National Chairman of PDP (South), Taofeek Arapaja, and other party officials were part of the entourage. As of the time of the team’s arrival, Obasanjo was not at his residence, as he is attending the interdenominational service for the burial of the late Olowu of Owu, Oba Adegboyega Dosunmu. He later joined his guests and they went into a closed door session. Obasanjo, who was twice elected president on PDP platform, renounced his membership of the party, when he fell out with ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in the buildup to the 2015 election. After ordering the chairman of his ward to shred the card to pieces in public, Obasanjo announced that he had quit partisan politics. Below are pictures of the PDP leaders at Obasanjo’s residence.
