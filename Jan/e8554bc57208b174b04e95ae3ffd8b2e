Leading chemical and agro-allied company in Africa, Notore Chemical Industries Plc has announced a group revenue growth of 43% to N27.02 billion for the fifteen months period ended 31st December 2021. In a statement, the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Ohis Ohiwerei said the company in the year 2021 changed its accounting date from 30th September to 31st December as part of the measures taken to strategically reposition the company for revenue growth and profitability. According to him, “During the 15 months period ended 31st December 2021, Notore recorded group revenues of 27.02 billion, an increase of 43% over the prior financial year (18.79bn for FY 30th September 2020). “2021 was a year of rebuilding and repositioning Notore to further deliver on its promise to Champion the African Green Revolution. During this period, the company carried out a Turnaround Maintenance programme (TAM), which led to a 102-day plant shut down. The 15 months prior to 31st December 2021 was a challenging period for the Company occasioned by the negative global impact of COVID-19 disruptions.” He continued: “This caused TAM to extend over a prolonged period with consequential effect on production output. Nevertheless, Notore has improved its facilities’ reliability, and is well-positioned for growth in 2022.”
