The suspended chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado, has joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking to Daily Trust yesterday he said he joined the opposition party because of the alleged political mess in Kano. Rimin Gado said while he has not made up his mind about contesting any elective position in 2023, consultations were ongoing. He said his posters flooding the streets of Kano State are an indication that the people acknowledge the “good work” he did as the anti-corruption boss. “I understand that PDP is the viable option to the political mess we have found ourselves in Kano because if you look at the scenario, it is like a jungle justice politics that is playing out in the state. “Based on my experience of having participated in this government, the operators here in Kano don’t mind public opinion as far as what they want to do, that is why we have a lot of negative PR,” he said. Daily Trust recalls that Rimin Gado was suspended in July 2021 for a month over his alleged opposition to the posting of an accountant to the agency from the Office of the Accountant-General of the state.
