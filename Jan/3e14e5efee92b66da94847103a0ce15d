Kannywood veteran actor and film producer, Aminu Sharif Ahlan, has revealed that it was unfortunate that Kano State lost the chance to host a film village that will uplift Kannywood as an entity and the entire livelihood of the people of the state. The actor added that it was worrisome that the people of Kano State fails to understand what a film village stands for.

Many countries are creating film villages to make people productive, increase employment and ease means of livelihood. “But sadly, the perception of our people is that a film village is a place like a camp where adultery will be promoted. We don’t have time for all that. People should try to understand us,” he said. He explained that it is worrisome that despite being a very vast industry, Kannywood couldn’t be accommodated by giant platforms like Netflix because Kannywood is yet to meet its standard due to lack of equipment. During the award night, Kannywood honoured some politicians among which is the Kano state gubernatorial aspirant Abdulhamid A. Zaura known as A A Zaura.
