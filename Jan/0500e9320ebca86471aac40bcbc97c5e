Ife Sons and daughters in Lagos and its environs will host His Imperial Majesty, Arole Oduduwa Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, the Ojaja II to a historical banquet. The banquet, which will hold on Sunday, at the prestigious Metropolitan club, Victoria Island in Lagos, is to honour the Ooni and to also afford discussions on the development of the cradle of mankind. In a statement, Lawrence Omidiora, a member of the organising committee, said the visit is to bring back the memory. “The visit will bring back the memory of the first visit to Lagos in 1903 by an Ooni, when Olubuse was invited by the then Governor General of Nigeria to advise on the eligibility of some Yoruba Obas to wear beaded crowns. In contemporary period the Ife community always accord their kings in high esteem. “The one day event will incorporate a summit with the theme: Ife Development Agenda – Aims and strategies for development. “The basic concept of the summit is to ensure the community involvement as a social movement in engaging people in a collective opinions, efforts and activities for decisions upon public concern which affect them, and to take responsibility in the changes that may start to occur in their community development.” According to Mr. Soji Awogbade, the chairman of the organizing committee, “Ooni Ogunwusi will highlight on his vision for Ile-Ife and the Yoruba people with a resolve to mobilize a collective commitment in the best interest of all.” He added that “the summit shall coordinate and aggregate opinions with a focus to implement decisions and informed opinions at the event.”
