The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned one Wasila Musa Ibrahim and her oil company, Najaatu Petroleum Limited, before Justice Mohammed Nasir Yunusa at the Federal High Court, Kano. Wasila and her company were arraigned last Thursday on a 10-count charge bordering on money laundering and tax evasion. The complainant alleged that sometime in 2020 the defendant approached him with a business proposal for the supply of diesel and petrol to a company known as Lee Group. According to the EFCC, the defendant collected N38.2m from the complainant and his family members to execute the business but diverted the money to her personal use. When the complainant requested for a refund, the defendant claimed she gave the money to one Alhaji Lawan who could not be reached. In the course of investigation, it was discovered that there was no evidence to show that the defendant invested the money. It was also discovered that her company, Najaatu Petroleum Limited, evaded tax payment from January, 2013 to 2020. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. In view of her plea, the prosecution counsel, Y. J. Matiyak, prayed the court to fix a date for hearing and remand the defendant in EFCC custody. But the defense counsel, Suleiman Abdulrahim, informed the court of a pending application for bail of the defendant and asked that his client be admitted to bail. Yunusa adjourned the matter to February 8, for hearing of bail application and remanded the defendant in EFCC custody.
