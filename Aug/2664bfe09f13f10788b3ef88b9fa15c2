The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) says it is partnering with different anti-graft agencies to ensure the reduction of the incidence of pension fraud in the country. Executive Secretary of PTAD, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme stated this at a sensitisation workshop for anti-graft agencies yesterday in Abuja. Speaking on the need for collaboration, Dr. Ejikeme said “It is important for agencies that like ICPC, EFCC, to really understand what we do, because of the perception of pension admiration out there as many people think PTAD keeps pensioners funds, which is not true. As such, we want to make sure that our processes and the way we conduct our payments is very well known to these agencies not just them, but also the general public,” The ES however acknowledged that there are few challenges in payment processes for pensioners, which form the bulk of the complaints received by the agency on a daily basis. “Certainly, there are challenges in payment arising from the Government Integrated Financial Management Systems (GIFMIS), but the magnitude is really not significant. Consequently, we are here today to look at some of the minor challenges while we sit with the relevant stakeholders and look at how to address them and also get input from the financial managers of the government “she further stated.
