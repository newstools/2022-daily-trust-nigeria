A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Breakthrough Action Nigeria (BAN), has said that over 900 cases of tuberculosis (TB) are detected in Plateau State quarterly. The state’s Coordinator of BAN, Dr Catherine Igho, revealed this on Monday in Jos at the commencement of the National Tuberculosis Testing Week, where she noted that the results were gotten from the hospitals and outreaches where researches were conducted. She explained that the aim of the week-long testing was to create awareness about TB and to also intensify case finding. She further said the aim was also to also put those vulnerable to developing active TB on preventive treatment and prevent community spreading as every undiagnosed and untreated case could infect 15 people within a year. She pointed out that during the testing week, those detected would be promptly placed on treatment as there would be prompt notification of persons who tested positive. Igho added that the exercise would help address the issue of low TB case finding due to low awareness. Similarly, Plateau State Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Ndam, said the essence of the week was to create massive awareness of TB via community outreaches, noting that the exercise would hold in the 17 LGAs of the state. Ndam, who was represented by the Director of Public Health, Dr Mafwalal Masok, lamented that TB as a preventable and curable disease had led to the deaths and disability of many. He, therefore, called on people presenting symptoms such as weight loss and cough which had exceeded two weeks to avail themselves the free testing and treatment at the designated medical centres in their perspective LGAs.
