A petrol hawker, Muhammad Abdullahi, and two of his sons were on Monday killed after a car lost control and hit them around Dei-Dei junction on the Zubwa-Abuja expressway. A witness, who simply gave his name as Abubakar, said Abdullahi and his sons were on a motorcycle going to their kiosk near Dantata community when the accident happened. He said, “The motorist on the other hand was heading to Kubwa axis when he lost control and crossed over to the opposite lane and hit Abdullahi and his sons who died on the spot. The FRSC Unit Commander in Zuba, Elizabeth Benedict, attributed the accident to overspeeding, adding that the matter was at the Zuba Police Division. The deceased have since been buried after a funeral prayer led by Imam Abubakar Ibn Abibakar of the Dei-Dei Central Mosque.
