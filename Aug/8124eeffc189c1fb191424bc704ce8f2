The governorship candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) for the 2023 general elections in Akwa Ibom State, Apostle Nyenime Andy, has withdrawn from the contest. Andy, who is also the party’s chairman in the state, disclosed this at a reception held at Ifa Ikot Akpan in Uyo LGA at the weekend. The rally was organised to formally receive Senator Bassey Albert Akpan who recently decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) into YPP. Akpan represents Akwa Ibom North East and chairs the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Upstream). The YPP, at the reception, also received former PDP bigwigs, including state and federal lawmakers. Andy urged the delegates to vote Senator Akpan in the coming primary of the party. Addressing the crowd of supporters, Akpan said in line with the electoral laws he willingly offered himself as an aspirant in the upcoming primary for substitution following Andy’s withdrawal of his candidacy. He assured the delegates that if given the chance he would not disappoint the party, adding that as governor, all the civil servants would be treated to social justice and welfare. He also assured the people of Eket, Uyo and Ikot Ekpene senatorial districts of fairness and equity in the next dispensation. Declaring that hope is by the corner, he said the next government would banish hunger, insecurity, hardship and injustice from Akwa Ibom.
