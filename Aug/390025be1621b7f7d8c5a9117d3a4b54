The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)  has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to initiate a process for Nigerians in the diaspora to vote during elections. The APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yakubu Murtala Ajaka, suggested this at the weekend at a town hall meeting for young Nigerians in London. He said, “INEC’s next move is to start organising the process for those in the diaspora to vote. By doing so, Nigerians living in other countries can exercise their franchise and be active participants in our collective quest to build a new and prosperous nation which future should be entrusted to the youths. “Similarly, the right of Nigerians in the diaspora to vote during elections as stakeholders gives them the opportunity in the rebirth, and of course nurturing of our democracy and a better Nigeria. “This will provide Nigerians in the diaspora the opportunity to vote for leaders with the zeal and commitment to move the nation forward and improve the lives of the citizenry.” He said lack of participation in the nation’s electoral process by Nigerians in the diaspora had continued to rob the nation of a huge voice in the decision-making process. Meanwhile, Murtala urged Nigerians living outside the country to support the candidacy of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the 2023 general elections. He said Tinubu had a robust and fruitful relationship with Nigerians across the geo-political zones, adding that his investment in making relationships made him the best bridge builder that Nigeria needed now.
