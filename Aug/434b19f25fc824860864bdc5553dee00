A former governor of Enugu State and Senator representing Enugu East, Chimaroke Nnamani, has canvassed more women inclusion in elective and appointive positions. Senator Nnamani condemned in strong terms the increasing cases of human trafficking, especially of women and the girl child, for labour and prostitution. In a statement to commemorate this year’s “World Day Against Trafficking in Persons”, the lawmaker urged government at all levels to provide stringent measures to curb trafficking in persons forthwith. He said, “Women bear an undue burden of poverty, ignorance, disease and sociological abuse in addition to displacement and denial of political spaces which shut them out from nation building. “Affirmative action is urgently needed to enable our women catch up or equalise in order to complement their male counterparts in the onerous task of developing the beleaguered nation.” He acknowledged the existence of the Ministry of Women Affairs, but suggested the establishment of the office of “equal opportunity” for women to specifically address the imbalances and other issues affecting them and the girl child. He further said, “Women’s rights are human rights. There is need to reserve jobs quota for women and address issues of job discrimination and the likes against women. Women suffer work place discrimination and harassment, stigmatisation and poor prosecution for rape and assault.”
