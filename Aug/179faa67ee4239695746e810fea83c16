Barely 24 hours after the incumbent Chairman of Tangaza Local Government and six of his councilors joined All Progressives Congress (APC),another chieftain of the ruling People Democratic Party (PDP), Colonel Garba Moyi (rtd) has followed suit. Moyi is among the commissioners recently re-appointed  by Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal after he reconstituted his cabinet. He had served as former Commissioner for Security and Carriers before quiting to aspire for the ticket of PDP for Sokoto-East Senatorial zone. Daily Trust learnt that Moyi was received by the leader of APC in Sokoto and Senator, representing Sokoto-North Senatorial zone, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko and the deputy governorship candidate of APC, Engineer Idris Gobir at Wamakko’s residence around 9pm Sunday night. The Tangaza LGA chairman, Isa Salihu Kalenjeni, and six councillors had earlier defected from the ruling PDP to the APC. They were received into the main opposition fold in the state by Wamakko, a former governor and serving senator, and Ahmed Aliyu, the governorship candidate of APC in the state. The councillors are Zakariyya Madugu, Abubakar Abubakar Kalanjine, Abubakar Aliyu, Halilu Aliyu, Ibrahim Sarkin Tudu and Musa Sulaiman Sakkwai. Kalenjeni, a three-term federal lawmaker, said they decided to dump the PDP after they failed to secure the party’s tickets to contest elections in 2023.
