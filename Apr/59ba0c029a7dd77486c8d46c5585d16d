Supporters of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, have berated the governors elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to stop attacking the apex bank boss. The governors had accused Emefiele of spending billions of Naira from the nation’s coffer on his 2023 presidential campaign. Reacting to the accusation at a press briefing in Abuja, the supporters under the aegis of Emefiele Support Group (ESG), described the accusations as “unwarranted”. ESG’s Director of Communications, Ms Benigna Ejimba, at the briefing, said the funds spent so far were free-will donations from well-meaning Nigerians who believe in Emefiele’s capacity to lead. “We urge the PDP state governors to stop crying like babies even when Dr Emefiele has not told anybody that he will run. “We know that the governors are already scared that Emefiele will give them a good run for their money if he decides to heed our call and contest. “That is why they have switched into panic mode and are looking for a way to scare him from joining the race. They should, however, know that we have their dossiers. “We know what they do with their local governments and state allocation. We know what they do with the money meant for small scale businesses in their states,” Ejimba said.
