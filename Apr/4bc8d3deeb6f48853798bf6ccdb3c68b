He said, “We have encouraged those who lost their voters cards or whose cards are damaged to approach any of the registration centres to apply for a replacement. Similarly, voters who had issues with their accreditation in previous elections have been encouraged to revalidate and update their information. “In addition, those who wish to transfer their registration from one location to another within a particular state or to relocate entirely to another state of the Federation can do so at any of the registration centres nationwide. “These steps are in compliance with the law in order to serve Nigerians better. The claim that PVCs expire is misleading. Citizens are therefore advised not to register more than once as multiple registrations is an offence under the Electoral Act.” He warned that anyone who engaged in the act of double or multiple registrations is liable to prosecution, adding that no citizen should engage in it or encourage others to violate the law.
