A popular evangelist, Bishop Kayode Williams, has disclosed that a former Lagos governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has been ordained by God to become president in 2023. Williams, who is better known for evangelism in prisons, having spent time behind bars himself for armed robbery, said the prophecy was given during a prayer retreat organised by members of the Integrity Ministers International Ministry. “God said Tinubu is His secret for 2023. The man he has ordained to lead Nigeria,” he said in an interview with Daily Trust in Lagos. Williams, who added that Tinubu will win the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as well as the general election with a landslide, stressed that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has not been chosen to lead the country.
