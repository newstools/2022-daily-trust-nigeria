The Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, has officially declared his intention to run for the 2023 presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bello, who made his intention public yesterday at the Eagle Square in Abuja, said Nigerians deserved a better treatment. The Kogi governor said he was in the race to win election and consolidate on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari. He said his administration would not allow non-state actors to carry arms against the state, adding that he would do everything possible to enthrone unity and progress of the country. “I am here to declare my intention to run for the presidency of Nigeria in 2023. I will run on the platform of the APC. I will ensure that progress is made steadily in all sectors. I will ensure unity and progress of Nigeria. “I am not one of those who see doom for the country. My score card is verifiable and tangible in Kogi State. 2023 is for the survival of Nigeria. “I won’t tolerate non-state actors to carry arms against the state, irrespective of what their grievances are. We must give peace a chance,” the governor said.
