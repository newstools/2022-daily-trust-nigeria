A former chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado, has picked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship nomination and expression of interest forms to contest for the governorship seat in the state. The form was purchased for him by the Concerned Indigenes of Kano State led by Ambassador Nafiu Danlami who said Rimingado was the best person to return Kano State to its lost glory. Danlami said they saw what the aspirant did as chairman of Kano anti-corruption agency and decided to task themselves to contribute money and buy the forms for him. Speaking before receiving the forms, Rimingado said he joined PDP as part of moves to rescue Kano State. He said, “So it is a decision of the majority of the people that we join PDP and I can assure you by the special grace of God PDP is the party to beat in this election.”
