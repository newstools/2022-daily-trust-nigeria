 Ameer Foundation for Youth Development has organized an interfaith Iftar dialogue for Nigerian youths to encourage interfaith communication as a way of achieving a productive democracy. The event, which simultaneously took place in Abuja, Jos, Kaduna and Kano states converged Muslims and Christians emerging young leaders together from politics, advocacy, religion and business and various walks of life to have Iftar and dialogue. The leader of the foundation, Dr Ameer Lukman Haruna, said the motive of interfaith Iftar dialogue was to bring together notable youths from various faiths to brainstorm, collaborate, network and become acquainted with one another. He said: “This will help to strengthen societal stability, interfaith discussion, and understanding, particularly among developing young Muslim and Christian leaders. “Unpatriotic Nigerians are taking advantage of our differences in religion to divide us and put us against each other. So, we felt there is a need to have continued discussions and enlightenment through such gatherings,’’ he added.
