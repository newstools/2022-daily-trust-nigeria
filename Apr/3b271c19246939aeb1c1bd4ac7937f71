After our marriage in 2007; we barely lived together for two years when issues started. “I am a Christian and he’s a Muslim; before we got married, he told me that I would be able to practice my religion without any hindrance, but that was not to be as he refused me going to church and wanted me to practice his religion. “His father, who is a well-known imam, said it would not be possible for me to practice Christianity in his son’s house. “My father is a pastor and would not want me to change religion because at the inception he had promised that he would allow me. “The religious difference was the basis of our separation and genesis of our marriage breaking down irretrievably hence every other thing collapsed, no more love as we could not agree on anything. “Our love was not enough to make either of us compromise our stand on our religions, there was literally no peace either; so it’s best to finalise our divorce so that we can both remarry. “We have a son who is 16 years, Abdulsalam Soetan. He is through with secondary school. So, I want him to be in his father’s custody; I promised myself to see him through school before I move on with my life and I have fulfilled that; now I want to remarry.” The respondent, Mr Akins Soetan, told the court that he was not interested in the case and would not show up again, hence that the court should go ahead and give its judgment. The president of the court, Mr Koledoye Adeniyi, adjourned the case to April 28. (NAN)
