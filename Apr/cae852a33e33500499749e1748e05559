Some prominent activists yesterday said they have commenced moves to democratically ‘banish’ the major political parties in the country especially the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections. A former presidential candidate, Prof. Pat Utomi, former APC Legal Adviser, Dr Muiz Banire (SAN), legal luminary and activist, Femi Falana, SAN, former presidential aspirant, Prof. Remi Shonanya, among others, yesterday unveiled the registration portal of the “40 Million Ballots Movement”, initiated by Youths on the Street Initiative. The “Movement” was described as an emerging political force of 40 million voters, which is expected to align with the much-awaited Third Force. Utomi, a prominent member of the Third Force movement, said despite the liberation of Nigerians from military rule, the civilians have proven to be worse. He said, “We thought that since civilian rule has come, we will be liberated. But over 20 years after, the politicians have set us backwards. We now felt that how could we liberate ourselves from these people, and a simple way was discovered; the ballot. “When you stay in your room and read newspapers, the illiterates who would collect cheap money, who are few in number, would go out to vote for them. “We need more enlightened people and a new set of politicians. We need to democratically banish the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) permanently.” Falana called on Nigerians to reject the status quo, saying they must stand up against continuity of unemployment, poverty and insecurity. He also tasked Nigerians to demand credible elections. “Since we have no other country, we must therefore vote wisely. Buhari has other countries, that is why he is going abroad for medical check-up,” he said.
