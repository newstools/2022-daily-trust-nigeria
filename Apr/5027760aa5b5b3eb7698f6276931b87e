The management of Jos Water Services Corporation and the state Ministry of Works have appealed to the residents of Jos and environs to exercise more patience as their water scarcity problem will be over soon. Recall that the corporation on Thursday last week said the construction work on a flyover bridge and irregular power supply were responsible for the water shortage. The Public Relations Officer of the corporation, Nangor Ndam, in a statement said the maintenance work at the Yakubu Gowon Water Treatment Plant has been completed and production and distribution of water to the general public had also commenced in earnest.
