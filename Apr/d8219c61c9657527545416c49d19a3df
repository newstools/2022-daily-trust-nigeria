Some members of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kwara State have threatened to quit the party if its leadership refuses to zone the 2023 governorship seat to the Kwara North senatorial district. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin after a protest, the members under the aegis of the Alliance of Kwara North Progressive Youth drawn from the five local government areas of the district urged the leadership of the party to be sincere in its choice of the gubernatorial ticket.

Coincidentally, the only governor ever produced by Kwara North was under the SDP platform who spent 18 months during the Second Republic. “Our people are poised to repeat the same in 2023 but if SDP fails to take the ticket to Kwara North, it will be an indication of continuous marginalization. We will have no option but to leave the party which will signify the death of SDP in the zone,” Mustapha said. He further noted that Kwara North is a ‘powerhouse’ politically with the second highest votes cast in the 2019 election results (34%); Kwara Central about (39%) while Kwara South (27%). “They are peddling half-truths and propaganda to serve parochial interests. We are warning the leadership of SDP at the national level that 2023 will be the second wave of “Otoge” that will reset Kwara if the needful is not done,” he said.
