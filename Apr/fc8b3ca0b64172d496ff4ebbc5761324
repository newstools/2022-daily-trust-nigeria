Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun says keeping to promises he made to people of the state in the last three and half years of his administration with limited resources, will give him victory in the July 16 governorship election in the state. The governor said this at an engagement programme organised by the State’s Civic Engagement Centre with the Osun Chapter of the Association of Master Bakers on Sunday in Osogbo. 2023 Presidency: Gov Emmanuel not running on zoning, says Suswam Imo illegal refinery fire: Victims get mass burial today Oyetola, who was represented at the event by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, said  the masses could testify to his achievements in all areas, which would make them support his re-election. The governor, who noted that he would continue to focus on quality service delivery to the people, said the will of God would prevail through the popular support of the people. Oyetola said that with the available meager resources accrued to the state, he had turned the economy of the state around positively for the benefit of those who elected him. The governor, who described the masses as the pillar of his administration since its inception, said that he would continue to make sacrifices that would make life more comfortable for them. Oyetola also said that he remained the candidate to beat in the election, adding that Osun belonged to the progressives, and nothing could change the status quo. “My re-election is God’s project because the masses are behind me, and they will return me to office in the next election,” he said. Oyetola appealed to members of the association, who were yet to pick their Permanent Voter Cards at the Independent National Electoral Commission office to do so and use the same to support his re-election.
