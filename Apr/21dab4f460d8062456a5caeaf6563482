Any man in my church who assaults his wife will get beaten, the General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman has said. Popular Nigerian gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, recently died at the age of 42 allegedly from assaults sustained from domestic violence. The gospel singer who shot into the limelight with the hit gospel song, “Ekwueme”, which she sang with Prospa Ochimana, was the lead singer at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre. However, Apostle Suleman while addressing his congregation advised women in abusive marriages to leave while they are still alive. The cleric asserted that those who choose to remain will only be buried if they die as a result of domestic violence. He said he would go to the police station to take permission before gathering brothers in the church to beat any husband who assaults his wife, noting that the Bible only said thou shall not kill, not thou shall not beat. He said, “When I once said there are certain marriages that should break, there was nothing they didn’t say about me. That’s why I kept quiet now, or did you hear me say anything? “But that’s what everyone is saying now. Somebody reached out to me, saying, ‘when you said it years ago they insulted you.’ “All those women that their husbands are beating, don’t they have brothers? If they don’t have biological brothers, they have Christian brothers. “If you are in this church and you are beating your wife, stop it. If she reports you to me, we will beat you. “I will go to the police station and take permission before I gather brothers in this church to beat you. “The Bible only said thou shall not kill, it didn’t say thou shall not beat.” He added, “Only weak men beat women, men that lack capacity. How did you get the woman? You talked. How do you keep the woman? You talk. You control a woman with your mouth, not your hand.”
