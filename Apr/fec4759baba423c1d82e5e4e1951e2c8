 The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has disbursed a N4.6 million loan to 228 trained artisans from the 17 LGAs of Plateau State. The Director General (DG) of NDE, Malam Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo, who disclosed this during the disbursement ceremony in Jos on Tuesday, said each of the beneficiaries would benefit from a loan package of N20,000 to enable them improve their businesses, reminding the participants that they were expected to repay the loan. The DG, who was represented by the state Coordinator of the scheme, Malam Ibrahim Hardo Abdulazeez, further advised the beneficiaries to utilise the money judiciously so as to become self-reliant and also employers of labour. One of the beneficiaries, Mrs Florence Ezekiel, appreciated the federal government for the initiative, saying the programme would go a long way in improving their businesses.
