A presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has thrown his weight behind the second term ambition of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State. The presidential hopeful made this known in Ilorin during a parley with APC chairmen across the sixteen LGAs of the state. According to him, his decision to back the governor followed his performance in the last three years, which has “Changed the status and fortunes of the state for the better”. He said the governor’s policy of giving political space to youths and women and his efforts to restore the dignity of the state in the areas of education, infrastructures and human capital development has been unprecedented.
