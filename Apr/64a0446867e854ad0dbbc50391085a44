 Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Thursday, officially declared intention to seek re-election in 2023 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Gov Abiodun made the declaration at the executive council chambers of his office at Oke-Mosan Abeokuta, when he received the nomination form bought for him by his kinsmen and women under the aegis of the “DA Mandate 2023”. He also immediately announced the re-nomination of his Deputy, Engr (Mrs) Noimot Salako-Oyedele, as his running mate. Abiodun recalled how the journey began four years ago when he called out the citizens of the state to join him on a journey of selfless service to build a secure and prosperous state driven by a vibrant economy and supported by quality service, equity and justice, saying it was gratifying that the people believed in him and gave their support. The governor, who expressed surprise at the gesture, recounted the many trials he and his team had to pass through in the quest to lead the state, adding that some people did everything to discourage him while “many people did not believe in us.”
