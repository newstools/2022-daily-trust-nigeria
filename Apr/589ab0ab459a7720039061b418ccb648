A former Chief Judge of Anambra State, Prof. Nnanna Umeadi, on Wednesday joined the race for 2023 presidency as he purchased the N25m expression of interest and nomination forms of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Umeadi, who was the State CJ during the tenure of former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi, was accompanied by members of his support group to the APGA National secretariat in Abuja, where he paid for the party’s presidential forms. The retired Chief Judge in March 2019 formally joined APGA at his hometown in Nri, Anaocha Local Government Area, Anambra State. Speaking to journalists after a brief closed-door meeting with the APGA National Chairman, Dr. Victor Ike Oye, Umeadi said he is among the most qualified of the aspirants, and that he is bringing into his governance, rule of law and autonomy for other arms of government. “I urged Nigerians to ensure that their votes counted in the next general elections. I believe that the 2023 general elections will be free and fair,” Umeadi said. The APGA presidential aspirant said that though President Muhammadu Buhari signed the 2022 Electoral Act late, it is better late than never. He also said that he believed in the financial autonomy to judiciary, and the legislative arm of government. He said, “When you have financial autonomy, nobody will have any excuse to do wrong, so that even a judge or head if judiciary, if he does wrong, he knows the rule of law and due process, he will answer for his wrong. “If you want to have a good country, you don’t have to put all the money in one arm of government. There must be financial autonomy for all arm of government.”
