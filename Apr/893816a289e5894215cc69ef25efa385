Customers of Jos Electricity Distribution (JED) in Jos, Plateau State, have complained about an increase in electricity tariff by the company and a monthly bill of N2,000 for meter devices imposed on them by the Distribution Company (DisCo). Some of the customers who use prepaid meters said before, if they bought N1,000 worth of energy token, they would be given 31 units, but later this has dropped to 16 units, adding that they were not notified about the changes. Lawan Haladu, a resident of Anguwan Rogo, was surprised at the tariff hike. “We are not happy with what we are experiencing these days with regards to the charges per unit. “Another thing is that when the new meter was introduced, we could buy N600 energy, but now you can’t get it. So, a poor man cannot enjoy electricity any longer,” he said. Another customer, Salis Ibrahim, said even with N1,000, he has not been able to vend for his meter. He has to pay N2,000 before he can get the units to recharge his meter and “even if you buy N2,000 energy, you must pay another N2,000 before it will open for you to use the token on the meter. “The additional N2,000 you are paying, according to the company, is going to be on a monthly basis. And if you don’t pay, you can’t use the energy you already bought,” he noted. When contacted, the spokesman, Dr Friday Elijah, said the development may be due to the new policy of the DisCo. He said: “For those complaining about the additional N2,000, it was an agreement between the company and the customer when the new meter was given to him. So, it is not a strange thing.”
