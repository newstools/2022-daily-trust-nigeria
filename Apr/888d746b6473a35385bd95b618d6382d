The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has launched a campaign against unethical waste disposal. Speaking at the formal commencement of a one-day road show in Abuja on Thursday, the Permanent Secretary of the FCT Administration (FCTA), Mr Olusade Adesola, said the show was to create awareness and spur action for the protection of the environment. Mr Adsola said stakeholders had faulted the worrisome state of the country’s environment on poor waste disposal by households and businesses operating within the FCT. Mr Adesola, who was represented by a Director in his office, Samuel Atang, explained that the administration, through the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) and other partners, had been making effort to ensure that all wastes were evacuated promptly. He said, “The FCTA cannot work in isolation, but needs the support of the residents to make the city clean for people to live in and enjoy. “Good health and well-being are a function of a clean environment, which is a part of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) to be achieved in 2030. And a healthy environment is the principal vehicle for achieving the goal.” The convener of the campaign and acting Director of FCT Reform Coordination and Service Improvement, Dr Jumai Ahmadu, said the initiative was long overdue considering the frequent reports about some residents converting public facilities to dumps.
