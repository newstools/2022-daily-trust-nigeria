NIPOST-CLRD had recently in collaboration with Transxor rolled out a revolutionary App and platform, ‘WeMuv’ for registering all logistics and courier service providers. Adewusi further said Nigeria is home to over 500,000 courier operators according to conservative estimates. “It is widely believed by industry experts that the sector which experienced a boom due to the COVID-19 pandemic will become an important source of Internally Generated Revenue for the government at all levels. The General Manager of NIPOST’s Courier and Logistics Regulatory Department (CLRD), Mr Gideon Shonde lamented that many operators are currently not licensed. “That was why we introduced daily, weekly and monthly payment options to operators who register on the new platform.”
