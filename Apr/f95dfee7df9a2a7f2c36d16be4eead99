A 23-year-old mother of two identified as Mercy Samuel has been found killed in her matrimonial home along Vom Road in Jos South LGA of Plateau State. Late Mercy’s husband, Mathew Samuel, who is on the run, is alleged to be behind the murder. Our correspondent reports that the body was found with her abdomen ripped open and her intestines cut. The state project officer of Women’s Rights Advancement and Protection Alternative (WRAPA), Jummai Madaki, has vowed to ensure justice for the deceased. Ms Madaki said, “There had been some violence against her in the past as confirmed by her family, but the husband’s family denied any violence.
