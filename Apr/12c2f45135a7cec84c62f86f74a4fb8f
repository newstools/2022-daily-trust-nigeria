The Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has finally secured the nod of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) to contest for a second term. The GAC is the highest decision making organ of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State led by the National Leader and presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Daily Trust learnt that the GAC, during its meeting at the state House, Marina, on Monday afternoon approved second term for Sanwo-Olu, thereby ending speculation about it. A GAC member who confirmed the development to Daily Trust said members were unanimous that Sanwo-Olu had done well to deserve a second term. “Governor Sanwo-Olu was unanimously endorsed by all GAC members and he has been asked to start preparations for his re-election,” the source said. It would be recalled that Sanwo-Olu’s predecessor, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, failed to get a second term in 2019 after falling out with the party’s leadership. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Sanwo-Olu, Gboyega Akosile on his twitter handle, @gboyegaakosile, confirmed via his post that the Lagos GAC had given nod to his boss’ second term bid. According to him, GAC at a meeting in Lagos on Monday gave a pass mark to Sanwo-Olu for staying through to the developmental agenda of the state.
