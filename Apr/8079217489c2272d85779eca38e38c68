Ayodele Oludiran, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, has petitioned the national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, against fielding Governor Dapo Abiodun as the party’s candidate in next year’s elections. The petitioner said Abiodun’s candidacy portended danger for the APC following “damning allegations against him.” Oludiran stated this in the petition signed on April 12, which copy was obtained by our correspondent in Abeokuta. He maintained that Abiodun was accused of “concealing criminal offenses he allegedly committed in the USA in the 1980s.” The petitioner also told Adamu that, “There are discrepancies in Forms CF001 the governor filled in 2015 and 2019 with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).” The letter further reads: “Abiodun’s profile can only best be described as a bundle of consistent inconsistencies.” He referred the APC chairman to his Form CF001 submitted to INEC in 2015 where he indicated under oath that he attended the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1986. Oludiran pointed out that in Form CF001 submitted to INEC in 2019, there was no mention of the university. However, the Afe Babalola & Co law firm, has urged Adamu to disregard the petition, describing the allegations as spurious and unfounded. The law firm, in the letter responding to the petition and dated April 19, 2022, described the petition dated April 12, 2022, as full of spurious and unfounded allegations meant to mislead the party into disqualifying the governor from participating in the 2023 gubernatorial election. In the letter received at the national secretariat of the APC by Ambassador Samuel Jimba on April 26, the law chamber said the petition was not served on the governor, which according to it “is a deliberate move to deprive him of the opportunity to set the records straight and knowing full well that the petition is characterised by falsehood and malice.”
