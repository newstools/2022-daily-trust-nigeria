The Office of Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF) has finally broken silence on the shutdown of the Open Treasury Portal, saying the platform will be restored soon. This is coming after Daily Trust exclusively reported how the portal has been inactive. Our correspondent had observed that the site has been down since Saturday. No explanation was given on why it was down despite the critical function it performs. The portal was inaugurated in December 2019 to ensure transparency in government spending. President Muhammadu Buhari had directed ministries, departments and agencies to publish daily treasury summary statements of financial inflows and outflows above N5 million. Also, the AGF and all MDAs are expected to publish monthly budget performance report, including their functions, and economic activities performed by them within seven days to the end of the month. Efforts by our correspondent to get comment of the Director of Information, Press and Public Relations in the AGF Office, Henshaw Ogubike, on Tuesday proved abortive as calls to his line rang out. However, Ogubike in a text message to our correspondent on Wednesday morning, said an ICT firm hosting the portal was having  some challenges. He promised that the problems would soon be fixed. “Galaxy Backbone are having some challenges. They are the ones hosting the portal. We are also under obligation to use them. The problems will be resolved soon. Thanks,” he said.
