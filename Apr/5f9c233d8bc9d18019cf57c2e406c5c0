A governorship aspirant and former Director General of Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Dr Paul Angya, has rejected the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) consensus arrangement. Angya said on Wednesday that after a careful review of the process that produced the “consensus” candidate in Benue State, it became necessary for his team to reject in strong terms the Benue State PDP governorship selection arrangement. The PDP governorship aspirant in a statement signed by Clement Tsar, his media coordinator, alleged that the process that produced the consensus candidate in Benue State was dishonest, not transparent, lacked merit, not in tandem with the relevant sections of the electoral act as amended and did not reflect the popular will of the people. He, therefore, called on the leadership of the PDP to adopt a transparent, honest and democratically acceptable process of nominating candidates for the 2023 general elections using the guidelines provided in the Electoral Act.
