The Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) has signed an agreement with Kaida community in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to provide 50 homes with energy through a solar cabin system. According to a statement from the firm on Monday, Kaida, which has about 250 homes, is not connected to the national electricity grid. The signing of the agreement at the NDPHC headquarters in Abuja was a prerequisite for obtaining a permit from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) for the provision of power less than 100 kilowatts (KW) to any community, it stated. Speaking at the event, the managing director of NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, said the 27.6KW solar cabin system was donated to NDPHC by Sun Africa, a US firm, noting that a 22KVA generator would also be provided for the community as a backup to support the power system. The executive director, generation, at the company, Engr Kassim Abdullahi, also said NDPHC was working with Sun Africa to develop on grid and off grid renewable energy projects that would provide about 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity to Nigerians.
