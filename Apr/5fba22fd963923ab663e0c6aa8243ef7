Angry youths in Ilorin have burnt the house of Mr Akintude whose son, Ridwan, stabbed his friend to death following disagreement over a universal charger. Ridwan and his deceased friend, Habeeb Saliu, were involved in a disagreement over the charger during a meeting at Baba Saka Community, Oloje, Ilorin on Monday night with other members of their association before the incident. Following the development, Ridwan and the family reportedly deserted the house before he was traced, rearrested and handed over to the police. However, on Thursday, the angry youths in their large numbers irked by their action stormed the building located opposite Airfoce Junction, Oloje area Ilorin, and set it ablaze. They also vandalised the block factory owned by Ridwan’s father and destroyed several thousands of blocks prepared for sale in the process. The Police Public Relations Officer of Kwara Command, Ajayi Okasanmi, confirmed the arrest. The HOD, Media and Publicity of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle, said substantial part of the twelve rooms story building were burnt during the process and properties worth several millions lost to the fire.
