Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State who is one of the top contenders for the 2023 presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said over 18 million Nigerians with PVCs are already waiting to vote him. The governor said this at the Second Annual GYB Seminar for Nigeria’s Political and Crime Correspondents in Abuja. He said he would beat National Leader of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu; a former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi; a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, and others gunning for the party’s ticket. Bello asked the founding fathers of the party to allow others to build on the foundation they laid. He said, “They are founding members of this party but foundation alone is not a building; you must build on it. “I know that there are other champions in the race. I believe that I will beat other champions in the race. Politics is a game of numbers. I represent the majority as the politics of this country is concerned. “We have identified over 18 million voters with PVCs who are ready to vote for GYB. So I am not afraid of going into the race. We are in this race to beat.” Governor Bello said he would tackle the insecurity if elected president in 2023.
