The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) in Benue State, on Thursday, disbursed N4.5 million to 228 artisans and owners of small businesses under the Micro Enterprise Enhancement loan scheme. The director general of NDE, Alhaji Abubakar Fikpo, said the disbursement exercise of the micro loan packages of N20,000 to each of the 228 beneficiaries indicated that they were serious minded entrepreneurs. Alhaji Abubakar said, “The ceremony we are witnessing today is a practical demonstration of the willingness of the present management of NDE in fighting unemployment in the country, and particularly in Benue State, by the empowerment of 228 youths and women under the Small Enterprises Department.” Represented by the Benue State coordinator of NDE, Emmanuel Ugela, the director general noted that the scheme was aimed at empowering graduate artisans to expand their businesses and thereby their outputs, as well as increase their wealth. He, therefore, charged the beneficiaries to demonstrate a high sense of commitment to their micro businesses as it was a stepping stone to greater things to come. Responding, Stanley Tersoo, who spoke for the beneficiaries, applauded the NDE as he assured that the money would be put to judicious use.
