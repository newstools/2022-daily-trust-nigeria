Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, father of the incumbent representative of Eti-Osa Federal Constituency, Lagos, has declared his intention to represent Lagos West Senatorial District. Daily Trust gathered that Obanikoro has informed the national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, of his intention to fly the flag of the party in the 2023 election. The present occupier of the office, Senator Solomon Adeola (Yayi) recently switched his political base from Lagos to Ogun State, where he would be contesting for the Ogun West Senate seat. The Special Assistant to the former Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs and Culture, Sulaimon Adebiyi, said Obanikoro is reaching out to chieftains and stakeholders within the party on his intention. “Yes, he is fully in the race to represent the good people of Lagos West in the senate in 2023,” he said. Obanikoro, a former Minister of State for Defence, was senator between 2003 and 2007.
