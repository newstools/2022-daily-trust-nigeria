9mobile, a local Mobile Network Operator (MNO), has created a self-service unbarring portal for customers to connect their National Identities Number (NIN) and unbar their lines online. According to a statement on Thursday, the 9mobile NIN Web Linking service grants a reprieve to customers affected by the recent directive from the Federal Government to Telcos to bar calls from phone numbers yet to be linked to their NIN. The NIN Web Linking service is a simple, self-service portal that saves customers the hassles of queuing endlessly to link their NIN. The Director of Customer Care, 9mobile, Ehimare Omoike, said the customer would go to the portal found on the telecom’s website, enter their number, and wait for an OTP to be sent to them and follow other procedures and their lines will be unbarred after six hours. Omoike explained that the initiative, the first by any Nigerian operator, would enable customers to unbar their lines without stress from the comfort of their homes or offices. “We realized the frustrations of people trying to unbar their lines and came up with the unique initiative that will enable them to regain the use of their lines as quickly as possible,” he said. 9mobile was the first to launch an intelligent portal for instant verification to help customers link their SIM cards with their NIN in 2020.
