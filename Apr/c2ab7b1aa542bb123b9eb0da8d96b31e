The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed April 20, 2022 for a meeting of its National Executive Committee (NEC) to be held in Abuja. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Mr Felix Morka, confirmed this to our correspondent on Thursday night. The April 20 meeting would be the first since the Senator Abduallahi Adamu led National Working Committee (NWC) assumed duty at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. Mr Morka, however, said that he had no details of the agenda of the meeting. But a source at the party’s national headquarters simply said, “The NEC will ratify key decisions concerning our primaries among others.”
