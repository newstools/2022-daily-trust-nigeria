Following the Supreme Court judgement that upheld the de-registration of 22 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) and the Advance Congress of Democrats (ACD) in Niger State have merged with the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). The two parties, in a joint press statement signed by Engr. Abubakar Abdullahi Gwada of the PDM and Yahaya Tauheed of the ACD, said they were both mindful of the implications of the judgement of the apex court. “The verdict of the Supreme Court has automatically ended the existence of those parties delisted by INEC. The stakeholders in the PDM and ACD have individually and jointly agreed to collapse all their political interests into the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) going forward,” the statement reads. They directed their members to proceed with registration with the NNPP at their various wards across the state.
