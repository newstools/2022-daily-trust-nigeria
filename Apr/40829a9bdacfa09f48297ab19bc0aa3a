 Following the recent explosion at Abaezi forest in Imo State, which claimed many lives, a non-profit organization, Spaces for Change (S4C) has called on governments to strengthen surveillance of extractive communities and oil exploration infrastructure. Ohaji Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State was on April 22, thrown into mourning, following a fire outbreak which led to the death scores of persons at Abaezi forest in Mbahu community along with destruction of property. Fact finding mission by Spaces for Change revealed that the explosion was a result of illegal oil and gas activities on a site allegedly owned by one Okenze Onyenwoke, a native of Abacheke community in the Abaezi Forest, said a statement signed by Sefa Ikpa for the organization. Citing eyewitness reports, it said the reckless activities around the artisanal refining site caused the explosion. “Devastated community members blame the government for not providing adequate employment and empowerment opportunities for the youth, who are pushed to seek alternate sources of income.” The group therefore stressed the need to hold operators of the Abaezi illegal refinery accountable for the criminal activities and be punished accordingly to serve as a deterrent to others. It also called for an in-depth investigation into the unfortunate incident to further unravel illegal refineries still operating in the State to forestall a repeat of such occurrence.
