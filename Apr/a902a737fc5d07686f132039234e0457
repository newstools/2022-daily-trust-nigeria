A 40-year-old man, Mathew Adegbenro, on Sunday, collapsed during a deliverance service at a church, Ultimate Miracle, in Pipeline Extension area of Kubwa in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. City & Crime gathered that the victim’s family had taken him to the deliverance centre for spiritual cleansing. However, following the collapse, some family members alleged that the victim was beaten to a coma during the deliverance. The mother of the victim, Madam Rebecca, said she suspected that the deliverance session had gone wrong when her son was thrown to the ground with his hands and legs tied. She said, “They forced him and tied him and threw him down. From there, they carried a bucket full of water and poured it on his body. “His father asked why. They said that was what they usually did. After struggling, they said they wanted him to have a rest and cool down. After about five minutes his dad came crying that Matthew had collapsed.” Corraborating his mother, Matthew’s brother, Tunde, said, “They beat him into a coma. They removed the clothes he came with, bathed him and put other clothes on him. “After he collapsed, he was rushed to the Kubwa General Hospital. Thank God he’s responding to treatment.” There was no response from the FCT police command as at the time of filing this report.
