His spokesman, Laolu Akande, confirmed this yesterday while reacting to an enquiry from Daily Trust. This followed an online report which said the vice president revalidated his APC membership status in Ward One, Ikenne, Ogun State on February 9, 2021. Osinbajo was a chieftain of the Lagos APC with his polling unit at Code 33, Unit 2 Victoria Garden City, Lagos. Laolu, however, denied granting any interview to the online platform which quoted him to have said his principal was no longer a member of the Lagos state chapter of the APC. “If you only manage to read the story, you will see that the event of the registration in Ikenne was last year or so. I did not grant interview to those online platforms at all,” he said in his response to Daily Trust. On Monday, Osinbajo formally declared his intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in a video posted to his social media handles. Meanwhile, the vice president on Tuesday night hosted APC Senate Caucus members for iftar at his official residence. He had on Sunday night hosted some party governors where he informed them of his plan to contest at the party’s primary in order to pick the sole ticket that would enable him to run in the 2023 presidential election.
