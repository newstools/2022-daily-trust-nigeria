The Ekiti State governor and chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGE), Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Wednesday, explained that his quest to lead Nigeria is to unite the six geo political zones. He said he was on a mission to build a better country if elected the president. Fayemi who stated this during a visit to the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, at his Alarere palace in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Wednesday, said he had been consulting with governors, political leaders, traditional rulers and leaders of thought on his presidential ambition. He said aggregation of opinions and counsel would determine the direction he would go. He added that that he had upped the ante of his consultation to some parts of the South West without leaving Ibadan and Oyo towns in Oyo State behind. In his response, Oba Balogun showered royal blessings on Fayemi while describing him as a courageous, honest and straightforward person.
