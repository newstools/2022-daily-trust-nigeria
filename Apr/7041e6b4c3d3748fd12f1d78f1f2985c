The Igbo Delegates Assembly has again advised the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other political parties to give the South East the opportunity of producing the next Nigerian president. The assembly is comprised of members from the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Igbo traditional rulers, Northern leaders in the South East and Igbo stakeholders in the North. It gave the advice in a communiqué issued at the end of its meeting in Abuja. The communiqué was signed by the president general, Chief Chikezie Nwogu; secretary general, Auston Ofokansi Ifedinezi; Eze Pampas Nwahiwu, President of Ndieze Igbo in the North; and Igwe Boniface Ibekwe, President of Eze Igbo in Diaspora. IDA emphasised the need to uphold the unity of the country, adding that a united Nigeria would guarantee a stronger Africa. It called on all eligible Igbo voters in any part of the country to register and secure their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs). The assembly also urged the Igbo political class who are eminently qualified to take a shot at the presidency and consult widely to carry every geopolitical zone and ethnic nationalities along when packaging policies and manifestos. The IDA also appealed to leaders to emulate the peaceful, brotherly love, understanding and synergy that the leadership of Ndigbo in the North and the leadership of northerners in the South East had been enjoying.
