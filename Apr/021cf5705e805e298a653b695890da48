Two students have been reported killed while three others sustained injuries after an uncompleted building collapsed in the wee hours of Friday night in Kano metropolis. The uncompleted one-story building located at Hotoro area, known as Hotoro Unguwar Gabas, behind Chula filling station, collapsed around 3am on the fateful night. A witness told Daily Trust that the uncompleted building was close to a Quranic school (makarantar allo) where the five students of the school used to sleep. “On the fateful night, two out of the five students died while the remaining were critically injured after the building collapsed on them. “The students that died were Ali aged about 28 and Abdulganiyu about 22 years old.” They were buried the morning of Saturday. Daily Trust gathered that the building was not well built as there were problems associated with its construction material; from the rods and the blocks used, some residents claimed. Spokesman of the Kano State Fire Service, Saminu Yusuf Abdullahi, confirmed the incident to Daily Trust. “We are aware of the incident but they didn’t tell us on time. When our men were about to go there, they told us that they had since removed the victims and took them to hospital,” he said.
