Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has said he has what it takes to match the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said this while making a case on why he should be fielded as presidential candidate of the  People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023. Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State had said the PDP risks extinction if it fails to give him presidential ticket in 2023. But when he appeared on Channels TV,  Mohammed said, “I delivered FCT when Buhari was euphoria. In 2015 when Buahri was an enigma, we won here (Abuja), I superintended it. “I went to Bauchi and won my election against the APC and you know Buhari was an enigma in Bauchi. To me, I always like being underrated. I am not saying that I am the best; I’m not saying as my brother (Wike) had said. I know he is qualified. I will blow my tempest because modesty is the key.” Mohammed added that Nigeria’s major problem is lack of unity, saying if elected president he would unite Nigerians and provide inspiring leadership where everybody will have a sense of belonging.
