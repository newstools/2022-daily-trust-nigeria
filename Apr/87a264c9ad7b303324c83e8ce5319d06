A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant from Taraba state, Hon. Victor Bala Kona, says it is the turn of Taraba North to produce the governor of the state. Addressing journalists at the PDP National headquarters shortly after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms to contest for the governorship in Taraba state, Kona said the present administration has done well and he is poised to continue and take the state to the next level. On the issue of zoning, Kona clarified that as the immediate past Chairman of the party in the state, it was zoning that produced the incumbent Governor, adding that based on the local arrangement all the stakeholders are now clamouring that the position should be zoned to the north. He warned that if the north is denied, the people from the area will respond appropriately at the right time. Kona claimed the Governor had tamed the monster of insecurity, due to his slogan of “give me peace and I will give you development”. He added that he was committed to making sure that the prevailing peace is maintained. Kona, a former PDP state Chairman, however denied that he was the anointed candidate to take over from the incumbent Governor. “Nobody has anointed me, it is only God that crown leaders. You can see the caliber of people that are with me on this project, from all the local government areas of the state. National Assembly members. This is to attest to the fact that I have support across the state. “My campaign team is made up of various professionals, business leaders and other stakeholders,” he said.
