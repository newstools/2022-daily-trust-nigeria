No fewer than 14 million voters are waiting to vote for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the Southwest geopolitical zone if given the ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye has said. He said this when he led members of the South West Agenda 2023 for Asiwaju, (SWAGA), a political group to pay a courtesy visit to the management of the  Media Trust Limited, publisher of the Daily Trust and Aminiya titles in Abuja on Monday. Tinubu is one of the leading presidential aspirants of the APC. Adeyeye said that in the Southwest, the former Lagos State governor is enjoying nothing less than 70-80 per cent support of the registered voters. “In the Southwest, if the elections come up today, we can get nothing less than 14 million votes from the region. And I don’t think there is any other candidate who can command such kind of votes from his geopolitical zone. And I have already factored in voter apathy. If you can look at the voter’s register in the region, it is almost double of that figure. When I said 14 million votes, I am saying that with all sense of responsibility without any iota of doubt,” he said. He said despite the fact that there are other aspirants from the zone, people from the area have made up their minds to support Tinubu. So far, he said they have secured the support of over 300 traditional rulers in the South West to key into the Tinubu’s project.  He also said that over 200 groups are promoting the aspiration of the former Lagos State governor.
