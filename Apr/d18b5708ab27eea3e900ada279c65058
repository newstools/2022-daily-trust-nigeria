The First Lady, Hajiya Aisha Buhari, will host presidential aspirants across political parties for an Iftar dinner at the Presidential Villa on Saturday. The information was contained in an invitation letter to the guests sighted in Abuja on Thursday. Invitees to the dinner are instructed not to come along with their mobile devices, but their invitation cards which would serve as their entry pass. Daily Trust, however, gathered that the ‘drop phone’ instruction on the invitation will naturally not apply to some of the attendees, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, governors and ministers. The Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the First Lady, Aliyu Abdullah, in a phone interview on Thursday, said it is standard protocol for guests at events in the villa, which would be graced by either the president, vice president or the first lady, to be asked not to go in with phones. He confirmed the meeting.
