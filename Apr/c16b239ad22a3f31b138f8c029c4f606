A mother of two in Kwara State, Yetunde Folorunsho, drank poison and died over her husband’s plan to marry a second wife. Yetunde’s neighbours told Daily Trust that she drank the poison after a disagreement with her husband over his intention to marry a second wife since as a Muslim it was allowed in Islam. However, in an online post, one Oyeronke Oluwakemi, who claims to be Yetunde’s course mate, alleged that she was poisoned by her mother-in-law over a disagreement with her (Yetunde’s) religious status as a Christian. Yetunde, said to be a linguistics graduate of the University of Ilorin (Unilorin), died at the general hospital, Ilorin, on Monday. But speaking on the issue, her husband’s brother, Alhaji Lagbe Araoje, said, “On Monday, around 10am, she (Yetunde) had a little quarrel with her husband outside the house; it was settled and she went inside. The husband later gave her a phone that she had earlier requested.  “Some minutes later, the husband rushed out of the house crying for help that his wife was vomiting. On our way to the hospital, she was begging the husband for forgiveness that she had taken DDT powder popularly known as Sniper. She died in the hospital around 12pm.” Also speaking, the husband of Hajia Nimahtallahi who operates the chemist where Yetunday allegedly bought the Sniper, Adio Tajudeen, confirmed the purchase of the substance from his wife. Mr Tajudeen said, “It was when the news of her death broke that we knew she was living in the neighborhood. People buy the powder for many reasons; we don’t suspect it would be used for evil purposes.” The police spokesman in the state, Ajayi Okasanmi, said, “A case of murder was reported by a brother to the late woman’s husband. But we are still investigating because there are insinuations of homicide. We have invited all the parties and deposited her corpse for autopsy.”
