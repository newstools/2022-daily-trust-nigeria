Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has renewed his driving licence while commending the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) for professionalism. At the end of the biometrics, he was issued a temporary driver’s licence pending when the permanent card would be ready. He visited the Eti-Osa Driving Licence Centre of the FRSC for the driver’s licence renewal. Sanwo-Olu was received by the Commander, Lagos Sector Command, Mr Olusegun Ogungbemide, in the company of some senior officers of the corps, who took the governor through the tripartite processes necessary for the biometric capture. A statement by the Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO), Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM), Mr Bisi Kazeem, quoted Sanwo-Olu as saying the whole process was very impressive and smooth. The governor’s wife, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, had earlier in the day visited the FRSC Eti-Osa Driving Licence Centre for her physical capture. She was also handed her temporary driver’s licence by the Unit Commander Lagos Island, ACC Esther Uzoma and Sector Head DLC, CRC Oluwafemi Ige.  Easy steps to renew driver’s license
