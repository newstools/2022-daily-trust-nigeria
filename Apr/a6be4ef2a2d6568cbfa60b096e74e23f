A former governor of Benue State, Senator Gabriel Suswam, has said the governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, is in the presidential race not on the basis of zoning but because of his competence and capacity to tackle the multitudes of challenges confronting Nigeria. Suswam, who is the Chairman of Udom Emmanuel Presidential Campaign, told newsmen in Lagos that the Akwa Ibom governor stands out among the aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as one who is well-positioned to make Nigeria prosperous. He said Udom’s campaign is centred around “revamping the economy” of the country and not latching on zoning. He said the issue of zoning has taken Nigeria backwards and put mediocre in the leadership of the country. “It is not about where I come from. Where I come from has taken us to where we are today. Where I come from is what has created mediocrity in the system. “So his campaign is about revamping the economy of this country. His campaign will revolve around addressing the infrastructural deficit in this country,” he said. Suswam, who is a senator representing Benue North East in the 9th Senate, reiterated that Emmanuel has the antecedent and the background to tackle the challenges of security, economy and the infrastructural gaps in the country. Meanwhile, the presidential aspirant on Saturday met with PDP leaders in Lagos to intimate them of his aspiration. The parley was hosted by a former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Olabode George. Emmanuel was accompanied by Suswam and Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Information, Ini Ememobong, among others. The presidential aspirant said there was the need for professionals like him to go into politics and contribute their expertise in addressing the problems of the country.
