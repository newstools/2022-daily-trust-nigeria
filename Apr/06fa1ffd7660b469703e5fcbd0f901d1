The national chairman of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Ralphs Nwosu, Wednesday said its nomination forms are free for women, youths and Persons Living With Disabilities (PWDs) who are interested to vie for any elective political office at any level in the 2023 general elections. Nwosu, who disclosed this in Abuja, said the move became imperative to ensure much-needed inclusiveness for women, youths and PWDs in the governance of the country. According to him, women and youths as well as PWDs represent 75 per cent of the nation’s population and therefore the need to mainstream them by giving them the opportunity to contest elections into political positions.
