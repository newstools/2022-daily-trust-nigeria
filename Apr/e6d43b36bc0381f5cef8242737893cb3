Two lawmakers in the Anambra State House of Assembly have defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ahead of the 2023 general elections. The lawmakers, Mr Douglas Egbuna, representing Onitsha North I Constituency and Mr John Nwokoye representing Awka North Constituency, announced their defection at plenary in Awka, on Tuesday. Egbuna, who used to be a member of PDP and a Deputy Minority Whip of the House said: “I’m pleased to announce my defection from APC back to PDP over reasons best known to me.” Egbuna left PDP to APC during last year’s governorship election in the state. Also speaking, Nwokoye said: “I want to also officially announce my defection to PDP for personal reasons. I’m no longer a member of APGA neither am I a member of APC.” The Minority Leader, Mr Onyebuchi Offor, representing Ekwusigo Constituency, welcomed the lawmakers to PDP commending them for their decision. “I thank you for making the decision to join our accommodating party. We welcome you into our midst as members of PDP in the House of Assembly,” he said.
