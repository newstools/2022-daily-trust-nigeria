As the Eid el-Fitr festivity draws closer, prices of perishable items such as tomato, pepper and cabbage have crashed in the popular Farin Gada market in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Some traders told Daily Trust yesterday that the development could be connected to more supply of the produce. Our correspondent who visited the market on Tuesday reports that despite the expected festival, prices of various perishables have dropped in the market, adding that hundreds of people have trooped into the market for business. Yakubu Idris, a tomato seller said, “At the moment, the price of tomatoes is crashing. This time last year the item was very expensive. A basket that we sold at the rate of N7,000 last year is now N1,700. So, the price has gone down drastically and will continue to drop because the item is available.” Nasiru Alhassan, a pepper seller said, “The price of a basket of pepper has gone down compared to last year. What we sold for N1,500 is N1,000. So, the price depends on the availability of the item. If tomorrow for example there is a shortage of it, the price will definitely go up.” But for onions, the price has increased compared to last year, as a bag sold at N7,000 is now N13,000 in the market.
