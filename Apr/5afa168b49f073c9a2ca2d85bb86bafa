 Ikeja Electric Plc has launched a 24-hour metering scheme as it intensifies the roll out of 100,000 meters. The programme, in partnership with Mojec International Ltd, commenced on Tuesday at the Shomolu business unit for customers in Ilupeju, Oworo and Igbobi areas of Lagos State. The company’s head of corporate communications, Felix Ofulue, said the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme provided a platform for customers who wanted to make payment to ensure that their premises were metered as soon as possible. Ikeja Electric said it had completed phase zero of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) and was leveraging on the MAP for the commencement of the next phase. Ofulue said, “So, we advise customers to take advantage of the initiative by Ikeja Electric and Mojec to get metered because we are ready to ensure that the process is done and completed within 24 hours.” He, however, warned customers to shun energy theft and meter bypass, stressing that anybody caught engaging in such nefarious activities would be dealt with according to the regulations governing the electricity sector. The group managing director of MOJEC International Holdings, Ms Chantelle Abdul, said to kick start the MAP, Mojec had set aside about 10,000 prepaid meters for customers under the Shomolu business unit, while over 100,000 meters would be installed across the Ikeja Electric network. Ms Abdul said, “We want to ensure that people get metered in 24 hours after completing the process and making payments for their categories of meters. “They don’t need to wait for 10 days as stipulated by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). The MAP scheme is for customers who can afford to pay for meters and don’t want to wait for the NMMP; which is the free metering programme.”
