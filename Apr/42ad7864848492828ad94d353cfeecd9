Meteorological experts in the Sudan and Sahel countries (West African subregion including Mauritania and Chad) are currently studying weather and climatic patterns to come up with the 2022 seasonal weather and climate forecast for the region. The experts who have converged on Abuja are from countries within the region and the weather prediction will help agriculturists, health care providers, transportation and logistics providers and other stakeholders that rely heavily on weather information for decision making. Speaking Wednesday at the workshop on Agro-Hydro-Climatic Characteristics of the major rainy season in the Sudan and Sahel countries, the Director-General/CEO, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) Prof. Mansur Bako Matazu said the week-long scientific research will produce the seasonal forecast for the region because of the importance of having reliable and accurate forecast for the region’s sustainable development in Industrialisation and modernisation. The NiMet DG who was represented by the Director, Weather Forecasting Services, Engr. Mailadi Yusuf also called for a feedback mechanism from weather information users so as to gauge the accuracy of the weather predictions. “We are not looking at the coastal part of the West African region but the Sudan and Sahel region. And the onset of the rains in this region is going to be from May and June,” he said.
