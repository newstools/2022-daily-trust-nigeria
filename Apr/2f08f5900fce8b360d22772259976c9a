A frontline governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Segun Sowunmi, has vowed that if elected in next year’s election he will push for a diligent probe and prosecution of those who have governed the state and plundered its resources. Sowunmi expressed worry that the state had been plunged into debt and so would require a new administrator to renegotiate the debt. Sowunmi, who was spokesperson of the PDP presidential candidate during the 2019 elections, spoke at his Abeokuta residence during Iftar (breaking of Ramadan fast) with journalists in the state. He declared that he would ensure that looters of the state’s resources were jailed, saying he should also be jailed if found to have also stolen from the state.
