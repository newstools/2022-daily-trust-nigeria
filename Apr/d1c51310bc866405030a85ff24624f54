At least 5,000 households in Abia State are to benefit from the solar system installation by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) with support from the World Bank. The project was initiated by the member representing Aba South in the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Obinna Ichita. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony in Umuahia, Ichita said renewable energy has the potential to meet the energy needs of rural communities especially at a time when the national grid was suffering from collapse. Ichita said: “The intention is to provide 24-hour steady supply of power off the national grid using solar technology that is not only efficient but environmentally friendly. “Besides constant power supply, 1000 youths will also be taken off the streets and given employment along the solar technology value chain,” he noted. The NDPHC representative, Mr Chinonso Ugwueke, said the initiative was introduced to provide 24-hour uninterrupted solar power to five million households in Nigeria who are off the national grid. The Regional Manager of A-Solar Systems, the firm in charge of the installations, Mr Ibrahim Usman, said the initiative was in furtherance of goal seven of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
