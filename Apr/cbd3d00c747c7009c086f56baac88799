 The Director General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Mallam Farouk Salim has said corruption remains the bane in the agency’s fight against substandard goods in the country. The DG also believes that corruption has become a global trend and is not only peculiar to Nigeria. He stated this over the weekend in Abuja at a Colloquium on the theme “Finding a common definition of corruption for Nigeria” organised by Corruption Observatory, a nongovernmental organisation that advocates good governance. Represented by the Director, Management Systems Certification, SON, Engr. Felix Nyado, the DG said for corruption to be curbed, “Both public and private institutions should go through an annual audit whereby organisational operations are assessed to identify loopholes. “A whistleblowing management system standard is crucial, a policy, which the SON introduced to ensure that whistleblowers are protected against persons involved in production of substandard goods in the country,” he added. Founder of Corruption Observatory, Engr. Ivie Richard advised the government to strengthen the level of compliance with rules and regulations. He also advised Nigeria to subscribe to international standards on whistleblowing.
