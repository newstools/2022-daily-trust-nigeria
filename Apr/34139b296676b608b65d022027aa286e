The Kano State Government has directed the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA) to immediately repair broken down boreholes across the eight metropolitan local government areas to stem the current water scarcity. The directive was contained in a statement on Sunday issued by Mr Abba Anwar, the spokesman to Gov Abdullahi Ganduje. ‘FCT school feeding will be sustained despite rising cost of foodstuff’ Kidnapped Kano bizman found dead in Kogi after N6m ransom Mr Anwar said Gov Ganduje, represented by his deputy, Dr Nasiru Yusuf-Gawuna, gave the directive at a meeting with officials from the ministry of water resources; water board; RUWASSA and chairmen of the eight LGAs. Mr Anwar quoted Gov Ganduje as saying: “RUWASSA should also take inventory of specific areas across the 44 LGAs that need boreholes, bearing in mind some implications of rampant boreholes to the environment.” The governor also directed the metropolitan councils to use tankers to distribute water to residents as an immediate solution. He assured that the state government would intensify collaboration with the French Development Agency (FDA) for a longer term solution to enhance the water supply in the state. (NAN)
