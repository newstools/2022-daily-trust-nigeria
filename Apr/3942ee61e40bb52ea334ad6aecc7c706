Governorship aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State have signed a peace accord and agreed to support anyone among them that emerged as the party’s governorship flag bearer. The aspirants, in a communiqué issued at the end of their meeting in Port Harcourt on Monday, said they have resolved to collapse their political structures in favour of any one of them that secured the party’s governorship ticket. The communiqué, signed by the 10 governorship aspirants and read before journalists by George Tolofari, a former commissioner of Transport in Rivers State, said the aspirants agreed that they should go about their consultations in a peaceful and civil manner, avoiding name-calling, insults and pulling down other aspirants to gain attention. Those that signed the peace accord were Prince Tonye Princewill, Dr Dakuku Peterside, Dr Dawari George, Architect Tonye Cole, Engr. Biokpomabo Awara, Hon. Ojukaye Flag Amachree, Hon. Mina Tender, Hon. Ibinabo Michael West, Sokonte Davies and Chief Francis Ada.
