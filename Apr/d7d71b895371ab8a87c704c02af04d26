A trader, Musbau Yekeen, has told a Grade “A” customary court at Mapo in Ibadan to terminate a 12-year-old union between him and his estranged wife, Tawakalitu, on the ground of infidelity. Yekeen, a resident of Apete of Ibadan, Oyo State, said he willfully agreed to the divorce suit filed by his wife because she had all along been an embarrassment to him. He said, “The major cause of conflict between Tawakalitu and I had always been her promiscuity, and I’m never convinced of her excuses. “Tawakalitu eventually got me arrested and detained by the police recently due to my usual complaint about her waywardness. “While I was in police custody, my brother and friends brought me various reports that the same man that was having unholy romance with her had continued with her with reckless abandon. “Out of anger, I told her to leave my house immediately. “Please, Tawakalitu is in possession of my land documents, I want them.” Tawakalitu had in an earlier testimony said she filed the suit in order to avert a sudden death that could befall her as a result of frequent assault from her husband. She further said that she sometimes swore on the Holy Quran to prove her innocence that she was not promiscuous. She said, “In fact, I moved out of his home when I could no longer cope with Yekeen’s battery. “Besides, he is owing me N90,000. “My lord, the man Yekeen complained about is an alfa and he only comes around to keep me company. “Also, Yekeen comes to my shop often to beat up my male customers.” The president of the court, Mrs S.M. Akintayo, pronounced the marriage dissolved and granted custody of the three children produced by the union to the petitioner. Mrs Akintayo ordered the respondent to pay a monthly feeding allowance of N15,000 for the children’s upkeep and directed Tawakalitu and Yekeen to be jointly responsible for the education and other welfare of the children while maintaining peace and order.
