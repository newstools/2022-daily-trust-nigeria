A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has hinted that he would soon declare his intention to contest for the 2023 presidency. Speaking with newsmen in Lagos, the former presidential candidate promised to unveil his perspectives on important national issues like security, jobs, reforming the petroleum industry, stable electricity, corruption and health, among others. He stressed the need for Nigerians to take a break from electing career politicians, saying nothing positive should be expected from them. He also decried the worsening corruption in the country, saying he joined the ruling APC because of President Muhammadu Buhari’s disposition to fighting corruption but lamented that corruption has continued to slow down the progress of the nation. He said, “The truth is that some of those who have stayed too long in the status quo have become part of the corrupt system, and it is an illusion to expect corruption to fight corruption. “Either in the APC or PDP or any other party, those whose only job has been to change from one government office to another and have never done any other productive thing apart from squandering government money, driving convoys of cars around that they do not fuel themselves, escorted by security paid for by government, are far removed from the true realities of Nigeria, and are therefore incapable of comprehending the urgency and depth of transformation Nigeria needs,” he said.
