The FCT Minister, Malam Mohammed Musa Bello, has summoned an emergency meeting of the FCT Security Committee on how to address the escalating banditry, kidnapping and robbery in the fringes of the territory. The meeting, which was held on Friday, also had in attendance the FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Tijani-Aliyu and all the heads of security agencies in the FCT. The Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Security, Ambassador Habu Saliu Mohammed and the Commissioner of Police FCT Command, Babaji Sunday, briefed the media after the meeting. Sunday said the meeting raised a lot of concerns about kidnapping and banditry in FCT suburbs, adding that the security agencies also resolved to do their best to ensure the incidents were brought to the barest minimum. He said all the security chiefs would meet again in his office today to further strategise on what was discussed at the emergency meeting. “We have deliberated a lot and have already put in measures, which are not good to air to the criminals as it will be to their advantage,’’ he said. He advised FCT residents to be security conscious and provide security agencies with actionable intelligence on criminal activities.
