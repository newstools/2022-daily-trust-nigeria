 The Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau, Prof. Isah Mohammed has said the declaration of assets for civil servants would soon be made online to ease the process and ensure accountability. The chairman who spoke at a workshop organised for staff of the ministry of finance said the initiative is aimed at reducing its workload and providing a way assets can be verified to prevent corruption in the system. While encouraging staff of government to key into making their assets public, he noted that this is to enable the government to bequeath the assets to their wards when anything happens to them while in service. “We will be going online to complete asset declaration and it will be much easier for people to do it in the comfort of their homes but before then, we are here to ensure that public officers know the intricacies of all this because, by the time they are doing it on their own, they may not have the benefit of contacting us to guide them.” On her part, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmad Shamsuna, said the event was to cautiously educate and sensitise public officers on the need to declare their assets as stipulated by CCB and non-compliance is a violation of the constitution.
