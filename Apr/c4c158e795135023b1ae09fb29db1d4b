The First Lady of Nigeria, Aisha Buhari, has urged political parties to consider women as running mates to candidates contesting elections into various positions across the country. She spoke Saturday night while hosting presidential aspirants from various political parties to a Ramadan (Iftar) breakfast at the State House, Abuja. Aisha said it was high time women were adopted as running mates at all levels considering their voting strength and active involvement in political processes. She said fair play for women in politics was to ensure their greater participation in elective positions. “As we approach the 2023 election with greater hope, I am confident that Nigeria will continue to grow from strength to strength on the pedestal of our democratic tenets,” she said. The first lady urged the presidential hopefuls to remain focused on issues that strengthened the nation’s unity, brotherhood and national cohesion. She further implored all the aspirants to ensure tolerance, fair play and avoid violent tendencies by building bridges where necessary, especially during electioneering campaigns. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who was represented by a former governor of Edo State, Prof. Oserheimen Osunbor, urged all aspirants to play politics without bitterness. Osinbajo said the event offered Nigerians from different faiths and backgrounds the opportunity to reunite with one another to foster unity. A prominent APC presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, prayed for brotherliness, peace, unity and prosperity of Nigeria. Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi expressed appreciation to the first lady for bringing the presidential aspirants together to foster unity and nation cohesion. A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Gov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, promised to play the game with humility and mutual respect.
