A campaign group promoting the presidential ambition of Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, called Osinbajo for President Media Council has released a statement debunking an audio attributed to the Vice President, ahead of the All Progressives Congress’ primary election. The council made this known in a statement titled, ‘Exposed: Plot to smear Osinbajo with false testimonies of discrimination against women wearing hijab,’ on Tuesday. The group says there is a plan to use fake audio of faceless individuals with fake names to discredit Osinbajo as a religious bigot. The statement read, ”The Osinbajo for President Media Council has uncovered yet another fraudulent plan to malign the reputation of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Vice President of Nigeria and a presidential aspirant on the platform of the APC. ”The plot has been traced to a cell of smear campaigners, led by a US-based Nigerian who was formerly a Students Union President at the University of Lagos. The same individual is currently a lecturer at the University of Ohio in the USA. ”The plan is to use fake audio of faceless individuals with fictitious names to cast the Vice President, who is a Christian, as a religious fanatic, who discriminated against the staff of other faith while he was Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State during the tenure of former Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu. ”In the fake video, a woman is seen crying and making frantic allegations that she was discriminated against by the then Attorney-General because she was not allowed to wear the Muslim head cover for women, otherwise known as the hijab, to work. ”As observed by someone who was in the same Ministry at the time Osinbajo served as Attorney-General, no such incident ever occurred and this is just a malicious and wicked attempt to sully the sterling qualities of Prof. Osinbajo because of his Presidential aspirations.”
