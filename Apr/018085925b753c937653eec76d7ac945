The National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) has reiterated its commitment to the local production of environmentally friendly Electric Vehicles (EVs) for use by Nigerians. The Director-General of the NADDC, Jelani Aliyu, spoke in Lagos at the just concluded Nigerian Energy Summit II, organized by Germany, the Federal Ministry of Power, and the European Union where he unveiled his agency’s plan to increase the capacity of Electric Vehicle production in the country. This, he said, would support the provision of more EVs that are applicable to the Nigerian condition, and would allow the nation to meet its targets for the Paris Accord and the 2060 net-zero commitment, both on reducing harmful gas emissions from vehicles. He stated that the council has started work on an Electric Vehicle Policy, under which there would be a set of fiscal incentives for both producers and buyers/users of EVs in Nigeria. He also presented his agency’s strides in developing 100 per cent solar-powered EV charging stations, sited at three universities across the country. These are Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, University of Lagos, and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in a strategic move that is aimed at bringing advanced automotive-related technology to the doorsteps of students as an effective technology transfer initiative. Aliyu’s presentation showcased a video of the first Nigerian Assembled Electric Vehicle, the Hyundai Kona EV, and also that of the Jet Mover Electric Delivery Van from indigenous Nigerian automotive company, Jet Systems Motors.
