Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP), Senator Kabiru Gaya, has said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is the right person to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Gaya told newsmen on Thursday, when he resumed office at the TPP in Abuja, that Osinbajo understands the depth of the country’s challenges and would apply the right tact and strategies in resolving them. The TPP is a mass-based and citizen-driven project pushing for the emergence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as APC’s presidential candidate. Osinbajo has already declared to run for president in 2023. Gaya said, “We are succeeding and my specific assignment here is to lead a process of recalibration of all pro-Osinbajo populist forces towards electoral victory under the banner of APC. Our duty is the coordination of all support groups. “We are democrats; we believe in uniting people and in submitting ourselves and competing for ideas to the people’s evaluation and decisions through the ballot box. “For us at TPP, the unity of Nigeria, as well as the unity of all progressives, remain paramount.”
