The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (CIPM) has said the institute is re-strategising to tackle bullying in workplaces. President of the institute, Olusegun Mojeed, who spoke during the 19th conference of Lagos State Branch of CIPM, said it is high time the institute took action on the raging debate “concerning toxic businesses, bad bosses, entitled employees and bullying in general.” He said people can no longer keep quiet and silent in the face of bullying by a toxic boss. “The old process of advocacy, strategic partnership, administrative expertise, etc. needs some reworking. We need to throw our heart into the matter by being hyper-responsive to people’s issues. People cannot be kept quiet forever. “They are no longer willing to suffer in silence. I still believe that if we take care of our people, they will take care of our customers and the business. We need to call out bad bosses, and businesses with unfair labour practices. “CIPM needs to, as a matter of urgency, activate our regulatory arsenal. We need to wake up, and shape up. We need to do it without fear or favour, with no consideration for the size or balance sheet of culpable organisations,” he said.
