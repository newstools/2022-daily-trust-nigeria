To tackle quackery, interior designers under the aegis of Interior Designers Association of Nigeria (IDAN) have called for licensing from the federal government to regularise the trade. The group, during a town hall meeting in Abuja, noted that this was to bring standards and policies to the profession and regulate its practice.

The profession is such an important one because we help the well-being of humanity through establishing functional spaces for people.” President of IDAN, Jennifer Chukwujekwe, said the government’s recognition would enable processes for professional certification for members. “Everyone needs a beautiful place. Whether to work, play or live in. Everyone deserves a beautiful lifestyle and space. So, when you understand that it is not just luxury, it will affect your well-being as a person,” said Chukwujekwe. She added that another challenge they faced was lack of good artisans because they relied on painters, plumbers, among others, to bring the designers to life. “So we need to figure out how to make them more skilled and more professional when they are dealing with us because the truth is our labour force is mostly artisans so hopefully we will see how we can train them,” she added.
