A group working to reform Tsangaya schools, Khalifa Dankadai Charity (KDC), has developed a programme to empower 6,000 pupils of non-formal Qur’anic schools called almajiri in six states of the country. The project coordinator of the charity, Khalifa Dankadai, made the disclosure during a Ramadan iftar with social influencers in Kano. He said that the curriculum was designed to reform the Tsangaya school system in Katsina, Kano, Niger, Jigawa, Zamfara and Sokoto states. According to Dankadai, the programme would be implemented in 60 schools across the region, and that 1,000 pupils would benefit from the programme in each of the participating states. He said, “The curriculum is to establish a standardised, integrated and skills-based learning system through the Community Library Project which is being implemented in collaboration with the Nigerian government. “The collaboration is between the federal, state and local government councils and stakeholders with the support of the US Embassy in Abuja.” Dankadai further said the stakeholders’ engagement was to interact with social media influencers and to fashion out ways to enhance mobilisation to fast track sustainable reform of the almajiri system of education. In his remarks, Bashir Ahmad, personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on digital and new media, lauded the gesture and pledged to support the foundation to enable it achieve its objectives. On his part, Sha’aban Sharada, House of Representative member for Kano Municipal, reiterated the commitment of the National Assembly to make sound legislations to facilitate sustainable reform of the Tsangaya school system.
