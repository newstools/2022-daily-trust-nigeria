President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the newly elected national chairman of the ruling APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, to be fair and firm in all his dealings. The president gave the charge yesterday when he received Adamu and the former chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, at the state house, Abuja. President Buhari expressed confidence that citizens would continue to support the APC in its electoral battles. In a statement issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu, Buhari assured the party and the nation that he would continue the struggle to entrench democratic principles in politics and the affairs of governance. The statement reads in part: “Today we should all be happy that the party has nursed its wounds and healed itself sufficiently to march forward to face the challenges of the coming state and general elections. “When I reflect on the policies of the administration on the economy and specifically in the development of agriculture, infrastructure, ICT and innovation and the welfare measures we have put in place for women, the youth and the less privileged members of the society, I get fresh confidence that our citizens will continue supporting the APC in our electoral battles.”
