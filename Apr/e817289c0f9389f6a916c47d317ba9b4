 The Executive Secretary, National Land Development authority (NALDA), Prince Paul Ikonne, has said that the Authority was working with the ministry of education to get 30,000 hectares of unused land from universities for crop production. Prince Paul Ikonne, who disclosed this in Abuja while playing host to Gombe State Governor, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, said the land would be used for cassava, maize and wheat production. “As we speak, we are clearing 100 hectares of land in Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) Imo State. We already have 100 hectares of land at University of Agriculture, Umudike and we have already cleared and planted plantain at one of the universities in Aba, Abia State. The agency is also targeting 2.7 million metric tons of wheat to help the country cut down massive wheat imports and reduce the demand-supply gap. Prince Ikonne said the projected target was achievable because the country has the potentials to realise the targeted quantum of wheat. Governor Inuwa, while applauding the effort of the agency towards achieving food security, said Gombe State was already making progress in wheat production.
