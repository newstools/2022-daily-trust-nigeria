The chairman of Roots Television Nigeria, Dumebi Kachikwu, has said he will vie for the presidency on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC). Kachikwu, who unveiled his 20-point agenda in Abuja on Wednesday, called for well-spirited Nigerians to support his aspiration which, he said, is a clear departure from what the APC and PDP represent. He called on Nigerians to give the ADC a chance, insisting that Nigeria could not get it right because the citizens allowed the same set of people to pilot their affairs again and again. Kachikwu, during a virtual broadcast titled ‘My Opening Argument’, said he will champion public service reforms, eliminate corruption and win the war against terrorism.
