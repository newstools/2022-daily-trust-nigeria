Address Homes, an estate developing firm, has said it is investing in luxury homes to meet the yearnings of Nigerians who are relocating from abroad. Chairman of the company, Mr Bisi Onasanya, who spoke to Daily Trust yesterday, said the company was changing the face of luxury real estate by delivering homes that combined high-class contemporary architectural designs with high-level finishes.

Homes that compete with the best that you can see outside the country, and yet, without getting you to break the bank in terms of being able to pay or affordability. “We see people who try to relocate from abroad – Canada, UK and Europe – and there is a minimum standard of living that they are used to. They like to enter a home, and there are basic things they look to see, the environment they also like to see. We found that these were missing to some extent.” The former Group Managing Director (GMD) of First Bank said he was satisfied with the success the company had recorded since it started six years ago. In terms of affordability, the realtor said the company offered flexible payment plans as its goal was to contribute to closing the housing deficit. He said, “We are very competitive in terms of pricing, but more importantly, we are very flexible in our payment structure. Right now, we play in the medium market sector essentially, and today we have a total of, both ongoing and completed, over 250 units of houses and still counting. The company has projects on Banana Island, Ikeja GRA and plans to expand to Ajah area of Lagos.
