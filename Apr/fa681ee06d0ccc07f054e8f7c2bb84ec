A member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibinabo Joy Dokubo, on Wednesday declared that she would contest the presidential ticket of the ruling party with bigwigs eyeing the number one seat. Dokubo, who indicated her interest to run for the office of president in 2023 at a well-attended declaration in Abuja, is the first female presidential aspirant in the ruling party. Speaking at her declaration ceremony, she said she would not hesitate to slug it out with a former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello and other aspirants eyeing the seat. The politician added that many achievements made by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration have been eroded by insecurity, saying she would tackle the menace through “neighbourhood watch”. The aspirant said she would improve on the security issues, education, women and children issues, youths’ restiveness as well as agriculture if elected president of the country.
