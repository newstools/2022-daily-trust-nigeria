Nigeria and key other sub-Saharan African countries are set to woo investors in the United States as energy transition talks intensify. The stakeholders, who will converge at the 2022 Sub-Saharan Energy Conference and Energy & Corporate Africa Leadership Forum in Texas, US this month, are expected to focus on ways to advance innovation and technology in the continent’s energy sector. One of the organisers and Chief Executive Officer of Energy and Corporate Africa, Sunny Oputa, disclosed in a statement, yesterday, that the event would open the continent to investors in the face of energy transition. Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State is expected to present the keynote address at the event focusing on utilisation of Nigeria’s abundant gas resources in the promotion of industrial development. While oil-producing nations of Africa push to attract investments and develop their natural resources, Oputa said the programme offers a platform for personalities that have contributed in the development and growth of the region’s energy industry to be celebrated. According to him, the event would throw light on boosting local content, community relations and sustainability.
