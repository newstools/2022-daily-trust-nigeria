Despite the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) having a substantive chairman, the suit challenging the illegality of the former caretaker chairman of the party and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, continued on Wednesday, as the governor filed a counter affidavit before a federal high court in Ibadan, Oyo State. The suit was challenging his role as the then acting national chairman of APC. Counsel to Buni and three other respondents, Mr M.D. Abdulsalam, confirmed service of application on the plaintiffs at the resumption of hearing on the matter. Mr Ajibola Salawu, who is the APC youth leader in Oyo State, along with three others, had in November, 2021, prayed the court to determine whether it was constitutional or not for a sitting governor to also function as acting national chairman of APC. Other respondents in the matter include APC; Mr Gboyega Oyetola, the Osun State governor; Mallam Sani Bello, the Niger State governor; James Lalu; Stela Okorotete and Odehe Akpan.
