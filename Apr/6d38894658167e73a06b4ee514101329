Emirates has launched its “Dubai Experience” for Nigerians travelling to Dubai for business and leisure. The platform was described as powerful and intuitive for customers to easily browse, create and book their own customised itineraries, including flights, hotel stay, visits to key attractions and other dining and leisure experiences in Dubai and the UAE, while experiencing the vibrancy of Dubai in a more exciting way, according to Emirates. It said customers could choose from pre-curated itineraries if they were first-time visitors, or if they had specific interests in sports, culture, adventure, or entertainment and the arts. They could also have fun creating their own unique itineraries from scratch, pulling from an extensive list of recommended activities and dining options, or mix and match, using pre-curated itineraries as a starting point. Emirates’ chief commercial officer, Adnan Kazim, said Emirates was proud to promote the very best that Dubai and the UAE had to offer on the “Dubai Experience”. He said, “This powerful platform offers our customers the ability to plan their Dubai journeys and stopovers, and benefit from exclusive rates and expertly curated recommendations. “Through the Dubai Experience platform, Emirates aims to add value to our customers and enrich their journeys, and ultimately drive more people to visit our beautiful home and hub in the UAE. We will continue to add more exciting content on Dubai Experience, and look at opportunities to launch it to customers in more markets.”
