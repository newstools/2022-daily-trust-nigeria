The speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Kennedy Ibe, has declared vacant the seat of the member representing Nkwerre State Constituency, Obinna Okwara. Ibe, the speaker, has defected thrice since 2019 when he was re-elected to represent Obowo State Constituency. The speaker, who was re-elected on the platform of APC, joined PDP when Emeka Ihedioha was governor and immediately defected to APC when the Supreme Court declared Hope Uzodinma the governor of the state on January 14, 2020. Okwara who, last week, joined PDP from APC, is among the six lawmakers suspended since December by the leadership of the house. Ibe took the decision during plenary on Wednesday. The speaker urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a by-election to fill the vacant seat.
