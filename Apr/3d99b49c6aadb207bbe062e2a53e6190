A septuagenarian, Oluwatoye Bamgboye, decided to end it all on his 67th  birthday by attempting to jump into the Lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos. He was however rescued by officials of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Police Command patrolling the axis on Tuesday afternoon. Bamgboye, who hails from Oju-Ore in Ogun State, said he was frustrated and wanted to end it all having lost a job he newly secured. He said he had secured the job only to be told that it had been given to someone else on the day he resumed. Bamgboye, in a statement by the RRS, said a personal challenge made him sell his house, land and car yet he couldn’t solve the problem. He added that he obtained a loan but the problem still persisted. “He explained further that, he secured a job and on the resumption date, he was informed that the job had been given to someone else,” the statement added. “Today being my birthday, I have decided to end it all. The burden and the frustration is too much for me to bear. My wife has abandoned me in the process,” Bamgboye was quoted in the statement. The police said he had been conveyed to the Adekunle Police Station, adding that efforts were in progress to contact his family members.
