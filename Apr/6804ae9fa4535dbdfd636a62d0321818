The Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) says it is working on bringing on the grid 40 megawatts (MW) additional energy from the newly completed Dadin Kowa hydropower dam in Gombe State. According to a statement from NBET spokeswoman, Henrietta Ighomrore, the agency disclosed this during a consultative forum with industry stakeholders in Abuja on Tuesday with representatives of Distribution Companies (DisCos), the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). NBET said the meeting is a precursor towards the finalization of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Mabon’s Dadin Kowa hydropower plant for 40MW. “This is timely and coming at a time the country is in need of every available power it can generate and wheel out to the end users,” it noted. So far, the plant will be the only generating plant located in the North East region when it starts grid operation. NBET further said President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration is committed to reducing carbon footprints and supporting climate change initiatives. “This additional power from Mabon will also contribute further towards reducing the current Weighted Average Cost of Power (WACP) within the NBET’s portfolio, as hydropower is a relatively cheaper cost of power generation.” The energy trading agency was set up by the government as an interventionist between DisCos and the Generation Companies (GenCos), especially on energy payment settlement.
