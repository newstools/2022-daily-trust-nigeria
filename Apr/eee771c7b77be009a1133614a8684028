An IT expert and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adamu Garba, has declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the ruling party. Garba, a presidential aspirant in 2019, announced his presidential bid while briefing newsmen in Abuja at the weekend. He vowed to transform Nigeria from “politically-divided unit to an economically-integrated entity” if elected. He said, “Fellow Nigerians I, Adamu Garba II do stand at the very centre of Federal Republic of Nigeria to declare my intention to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 elections. “The major interest that galvanised the global community about Nigeria is human and economic resources. But our leaders had paid too much attention to political division instead of the economy that will unite the country and make it stronger. “We intend to drive a Nigeria that will be economically integrated. Our vision is to transform Nigeria from a politically-divided unit to an economically-integrated unit. “This will be done by developing an economic blueprint that will see the emergence of nine geo-economic zones as opposed to the current six geo-political zones.” He said his administration would invest heavily in building infrastructure, including road networks and inland waterways, power and rail networks. This, he said, would make the movement of humans and goods cheaper and affordable, with a multiplier effect on the economy. The presidential aspirant said the country’s security problem was driven by politics and that addressing the menace would require the setting up of a council where all ethnic nationalities would discuss issues of common interest.
