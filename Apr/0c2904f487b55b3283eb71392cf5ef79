The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called for the scrapping of the State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) over alleged consistent electoral malpractices characterising them. The National Chairman of IPAC, the umbrella body of the 18 registered political parties, Engr. Yabagi Yusuf Sani, made the call on Tuesday when the United Nations Electoral Needs Assessment Mission (NAM) visited the council’s headquarters in Abuja. He was represented by the National Secretary of the council, Alhaji Yusuf Mamman Dantalle. The “Council will continue to engage stakeholders, particularly the National Assembly, for further reform of the electoral process, including the scrapping of the State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) as Nigerians have lost confidence in their ability to conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive elections at the grassroots. “Polls conducted by various SIECs in the country are mere charades with predetermined outcomes that make a mockery of our democratic encounter. “Accordingly, IPAC will boycott these electoral jamborees by state governments in power which have impeded the nation’s democratic advancement at the grassroots,” he said.
