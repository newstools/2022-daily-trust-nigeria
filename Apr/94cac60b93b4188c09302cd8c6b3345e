The Youth Leader of the United Kingdom chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APoC), Dr Usman Tijjani Shehu, has dumped the ruling party for the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). He confirmed his resignation in a letter addressed to the ward chairman of the APC in Kabo LGA and copied to the United Kingdom chapter of the party, a copy of which was made available to Daily Trust. The former youth leader, who is an aspirant for the House of Representatives for Kabo/Gwarzo constituency, said he decided to dump the party for the fact that it has failed Nigerians and couldn’t fulfil its campaign promises. He accused the ruling party of sabotaging the overall development of the country, and not giving opportunities to young Nigerians. “Presently in the country, there are no jobs, ASUU is on strike, there are security challenges, lack of health care facilities, poor economy and lack of youth inclusion in governance,” he said.
