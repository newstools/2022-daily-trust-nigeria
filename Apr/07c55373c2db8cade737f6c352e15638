CHI Limited, makers of fruit juice and value-added dairy brands, has said it is offering nutrition support to Muslims in the holy month of Ramadan when millions of the faithful are devoting themselves to fasting, prayer and communal bonding. In a statement, yesterday, the company said it encourages the Muslim faithful to complement their Sahur and Iftar meals with nutritional requirements needed to stay fit throughout the Ramadan. Through its latest media communication campaign tagged ‘Let the Blessings flow from Sahur to Iftar’ and ‘We’re with You Every Step of the Way’, the company highlights the spiritual blessings associated with the Ramadan fasting. It also assures consumers that it can play a healthy nourishing role as part of their Sahur meals by providing the body with the energy required to undertake daily activities and nourishment as part of their Iftar meals. According to nutritionists, when breaking the fast, drinks with natural electrolytes and essential vitamins like juices or yoghurt can provide energy, and replace fluids that are good to keep the stomach balanced. In her comment, CHI Limited Marketing Director, Mrs Toyin Nnodi, said “Our range of Chivita juices and Hollandia dairy brands provide consumers the right nourishment to complement their Sahur and Iftar meals to enable them to stay hydrated, nourished and healthy through the course of the Ramadan fast.”
