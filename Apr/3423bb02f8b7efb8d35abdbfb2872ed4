The new eight-member council is led by the chairman and emir of Kano, HRH Aminu Ado Bayero, officials of the oil sector publication said in a statement. The statement also said the council members were selected in recognition of their track records in the development of local content in the oil and gas industry. Other members of the council include Mr Hasan Hafidh, the spokesman of OPEC; Prof Wumi Iledare, GNPC professor and chair, petroleum economics and management, Cape Coast University, Ghana; Mrs Omotayo Omotoso, former director general, Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation; with the council secretary as Musa Bashir Usman who is the group publisher/editor-in-chief of the magazine. In a letter conveying his appreciation and acceptance to serve as chairman of the editorial advisory council, the emir of Kano assured of his support and cooperation. OPEC secretary general, also in an acceptance letter as alternate chairman to the council, said: “I agree wholeheartedly that the last six years have been eventful and historic for the oil industry, but all successes achieved have been a result of teamwork and collaborative ethos.” The publisher, Usman said, “We are delighted to welcome these distinguished and globally revered individuals and thought leaders to the council and look forward to working with them.” The oil sector publication started in Abuja on July 17, 2018, and has since evolved into an established media group, with an online TV channel added to its stable.
