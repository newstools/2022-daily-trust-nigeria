The former minister of aviation under Goodluck Jonathan, and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Osita Chidoka, has said that Nigerians should choose an Igbo President in the 2023 presidential elections. The former Corps Marshal stated so during a session on Arise News program, “Political Economy Ahead of 2023 Election,” on Monday. Chidoka said PDP should zone its Presidency to the South-East because no region in Nigeria has ever come together to produce a candidate. He said, “Whenever people said to me that the South-East needs to come together to produce a candidate, I have always said which region in Nigeria has ever come together to produce a candidate? “What I have always argued about the Igbo presidency is that the rest of Nigeria should choose the Igbo man of their choice. “It is not for the Igbo to give you a candidate, because whoever they give you might not be acceptable to the rest of the country. Chidoka continued, “The idea that Igbos should come together to produce a president is that if you zone to the South-East, the rest of the country will make up their minds whether they want Senator Pius Anyim who has knowledge of the presidency and has been Secretary to Government, or they want Peter Obi who brings to the table his frugal financial management skills and his record of governance in Anambra, or they want Governor Mahi who they believe has done a lot of infrastructural projects in his state. “It is the rest of Nigeria that will make that decision. The Igbos’ votes alone cannot make him president,” said Chidoka.
