A former vice president and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has said his quest to become the next president of Nigeria is to create an opportunity for youths to take the driving seat. Atiku stated this on Tuesday when he hosted representatives of Atiku Abubakar Support Groups that converged on Abuja to map out strategies to woo PDP delegates and other party supporters to key into Atiku’s presidential ambition. The former vice president also disclosed that his quest to become the governor of Adamawa State hit a brick wall four times, saying he started active participation in politics in his late 30s. He said as vice president, he was able to influence the appointment of young Nigerians into sensitive offices in the country arguing that if he emerges as the next president of the country, he will groom youths that will take over governance. He said: “Leadership is a competition; it is not going to be easy. I also started the journey like some of you, in my late 30s, to run for governor alone, I ran four times before I eventually got elected. So you need to be determined, you need to be consistent, you need to be courageous.”
