Babafemi Ojudu, Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, says he nominated Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to serve as Attorney-General when Bola Tinubu was governor of Lagos State. Osinbajo served as Attorney-General between 1999 and 2007 when Tinubu governed Lagos. In an interview with media entrepreneur, Chude Jideonwo, Ojudu said he introduced Osinbajo to Tinubu when the latter asked him to nominate someone competent to be attorney-general of Lagos. “If I support Osinbajo, he deserves to be supported; I’ve known him since 1989. And in 1999, when I worked for Ahmed Bola Tinubu to become governor, he asked me if I knew someone who would become a good attorney-general and I said I have a lawyer who is smart and principled and he said go and call him,” he said. The former Senator also said Osinbajo is passionate about federalism who has proved himself for eight years. “We sat down with him for one hour talking about federalism and the man [Osinbajo] for eight years proved himself. I was vindicated. He is comfortable with the young and old. He is comfortable with new technology and always coming out with solutions to problems. It doesn’t cost me anything to align with such a person. “I’m looking for a better society where people don’t pile all the resources into their personal account. I have the right to support that kind of person.”
