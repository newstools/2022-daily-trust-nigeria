Mr Pam Jonah Jang, son of ex-Plateau governor Jonah Jang has joined the list of politicians contesting in the Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency election in 2023. The aspirant was presented with the nomination firms purchased from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by a committee of friends. While presenting the forms to Mr Pam at a ceremony held at Tamarald Hotel Jos, on Tuesday, Dr Dagwom D toang said, “We fished him out because we want quality representation for people of our constituency in 2023. “We have done our survey on Mr Pam Jonah Jang, and we have seen he has the leadership qualities to represent us at the national assembly. That is why we purchased the forms for him so that he will not have any excuse to turn down the offer.” In his acceptance remarks, Pam said, “I consider this a great honour done to me by my friends. “As I humbly accept this clarion call to serve my great people of Jos East/Jos South Federal Constituency in the National Assembly.”
