Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has called on religious leaders in the country to continue to preach against youth involvement in social vices, saying it is capable of destroying their future. Gov Abiodun said this in Abeokuta during the breaking of fast (Iftar) organised for the state’s League of Imams and Alfas, noting that many youths were deeply involved in vices like cultism, cybercrime and kidnapping, hence the need for the religious leaders to continue to speak against them. The governor said cultism had taken over every facet of the society, including primary and secondary schools, which he noted was not acceptable, maintaining that a lot of youths did not want to work even when they had the opportunity to engage in legitimate ventures. He said, “We are coming up with a law that will make landlords who accommodate cultists lose their houses. Our state is the religious capital of this country, where prayers are answered. This should reflect on our children. Please continue to preach and pray for our youths.”
