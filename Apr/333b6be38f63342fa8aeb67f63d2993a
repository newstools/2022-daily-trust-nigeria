The National Coordinator of Tinubu School to School Campaign, Hon. Hamza Auta Mohammed, has said that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is not a threat to the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Mohammed, who spoke with Daily Trust in Abuja, said the vice president lacked the political clout to win election even in his native local government. “We have never looked at Prof. Osinbajo as somebody that is a threat to Tinubu. He is never a threat to us. Constitutionally, he has the right to contest; nobody is stopping him from contesting but he is never a threat to Tinubu. “What are his political antecedents, what is his track record and what are the structures that he has on ground to win election? “Our candidate is going round consulting with critical stakeholders from all the zones in the country so we are not looking at Osinbajo as a threat to our principal in whatever ramification you think,” he said. Despite concerns about Tinubu’s capability to lead the country, especially his alleged failing health and old age, the youth leader insisted the APC chieftain is fit, is a nationalist and has what it takes to fix the country. Daily Trust reports that both Osinbajo and Tinubu are jostling to pick the presidential ticket of the APC
