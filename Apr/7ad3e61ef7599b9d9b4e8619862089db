The Ondo State House of Assembly Thursday sacked its former Deputy Speaker, Iroju Ogundeji and declared his seat vacant. Ogundeji, who was elected on the platform of the APC, represents Odigbo Constituency 1 in the state House of Assembly. He was said to have decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on March 19. The assembly, presided over by the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct by-election in Odigbo Constituency I within 90 days. The Clerk of the assembly, Jayeola Benjamin, had read a letter written by the APC chairman in the state, Ade Adetimehin, requesting the House to declare Ogundeji’s seat vacant. Adetimehin said the request was sequel to the letter written to the party by Ogundeji on March 19, notifying it of his resignation from the ruling party. The APC chairman quoted Section 109 of the 1999 Constitution as stating that any lawmaker who became a member of any political party other than the one under whose platform he was elected into the assembly must vacate his seat. The Majority Leader of the assembly, Oluwole Ogunmolasuyi (APC-Owo II), therefore, moved a motion that Ogundeji’s seat should be declared vacant and was seconded by the Deputy Speaker, Samuel Aderoboye (Odigbo II). The speaker then declared the former deputy speaker’s seat vacant, based on APC’s letter and in accordance with the constitution, he said. He directed that a letter be written to INEC to conduct a by-election in the constituency within 90 days. In his reaction to the development, Ogundeji, however, said the assembly had acted contrary to the order of the court He said he decided to join PDP, owing to what he called division in the ruling party, adding that he had been denied his membership of the APC for about a year and a half ago.
