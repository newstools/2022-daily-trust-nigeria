Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State has said that he will never be a party to a consensus candidate in PDP as being bandied about. Wike spoke in Calabar when he came to consult the party for his presidential aspiration. He condemned those asking for consensus, saying all the aspirants should go to the field and work and the party must not condescend to accepting a consensus a candidate.

They came to me, and I have told them bluntly that I am not a party to it,” he said. Wike also maintained that he is emphatically running for the office of President and will not negotiate for even the office of Vice President with anybody. He said, “I am going round all the states in Nigeria to confirm that I will run for president of Nigeria. I don’t want to be recognised as a former presidential aspirant, but to run and win the presidential election. “I am not going to negotiate for Vice President but to win the PDP ticket and win the election. People have pressurised me to rather buy the ticket for Senate. But I said I am quite fit and ready for the race. “I am ready to demonstrate power; and power to win the election, nothing more. I have more energy to dissipate.”
