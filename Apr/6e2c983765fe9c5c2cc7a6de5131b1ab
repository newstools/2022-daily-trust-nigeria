An Ikeja magistrates’ court in Lagos State, on Thursday, ordered that a 50-year-old man, Chidi Eze, be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre for raping his friend’s sister. The prosecutor earlier told the court that Eze committed the offence on March 13, on Rabiu Ajose Street, Isheri Osun, Lagos, when he raped his friend’s sister. The magistrate, Ejiro Kubeinje, gave the order following a motion moved by the prosecutor, DSP Kehinde Ajayi, that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice and adjourned the case to May 5.
