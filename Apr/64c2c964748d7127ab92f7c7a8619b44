 The Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission (KATSIEC) yesterday began the distribution of sensitive election materials to the 34 local government areas of the state ahead of today’s poll. Briefing newsmen while dispatching the election materials at the Central Bank of Nigeria Katsina branch, the commission’s chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Bako, said over 9,000 ad hoc staff of the commission would conduct the election while there are over three million registered voters in the state. He explained that 12 political parties would participate in the elections and urged parties and their candidates to be of peaceful conduct and abide by election guidelines as stipulated by the Electoral Act. Similarly, the Ekiti State Police Command has called on political parties in the state to shun violence during their campaigns in line with the constitution and the Electoral Act. CP Morenkeji Adesina, gave the warning at the command headquarters in Ado-Ekiti, saying all political parties have the right to hold rallies in any part of the state without fear of intimidation. Adesina noted that the parties and their flag bearers were expected to inform the electorate what they intend to offer them rather than disparaging and discrediting their opponents.
