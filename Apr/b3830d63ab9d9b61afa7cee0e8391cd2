Two people have been reported dead and three others injured after an uncompleted one-storey at Hotoro Unguwar Gabas, behind Chula filling station, collapsed around 3am on Friday. A witness told City & Crime that the building was close to a Quranic school in which some of its students used to sleep. He said, “On the fateful night, two out of five students who were sleeping in the building died while the remaining three were seriously injured.” Spokesman of the Kano State fire service, Mr Saminu Yusuf Abdullahi, told our correspondent that, “We are aware of the incident, but they didn’t tell us on time. When our men were about to go there, they told us that they had since removed the victims and taken them to hospital.”
