The Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) and the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) have thrown their weights behind a policy on operations for blockchain businesses in the country. In a press statement yesterday, the managing director of NEPZA, Prof Adesoji Adesugba, stated that the authority was considering the launch of a policy in consultation with other relevant agencies on the opening up of Nigeria’s free zones to blockchain tech and crypto currency operations. Prof Adesugba, while speaking with two blockchain firms during a visit to his office, noted that Nigeria was missing out in revenue from the sector. On its part, ACCI stated that it would support a roundtable on ways the multi-trillion dollar crypto currency and block chain tech policy could be developed in the country. Faruk Shauibu
