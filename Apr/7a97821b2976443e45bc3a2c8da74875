He was rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, where he was pronounced dead. A member of the church clarified that Ogunnusi “was not the pastor of the church; he was just an elder. He was the Baale of Onikoko. But he was the one that delivered the sermon on Sunday. “He was talking about death and people who make money by killing other people, and all of a sudden he collapsed. He was rushed to the FMC, but he died. We don’t know what happened. I was very scared. Everything was disrupted. We just shared the grace and went home.”
