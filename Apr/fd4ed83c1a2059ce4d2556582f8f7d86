Ahead of the Eid el-Fitr celebration, the Kwali Area Council chapter of the Federation of Muslim Women Associations of Nigeria (FOMWAN) in the FCT has distributed clothes to over 600 orphans and widows in the area. Speaking during the distribution on Sunday in Kwali, the amira of FOMWAN in the area, Malama Aishatu Yamta Bukar, said the distribution was to help the orphans and widows to celebrate the Eid el-Fitr in good mood. She commended Babakafi Orphanage for being of tremendous help to orphans in terms of payment of school fees, monthly stipends and clothing. She, therefore, called on wealthy individuals and corporate organisations to come to the aid of the orphans, widows and the less privileged in order to better their lives. Also speaking, the secretary of Daru’l Erkam Foundation, who was a special guest at the event, said the aim of the foundation was to help the Muslim ummah and humanity at large. He also donated foodstuff and clothes to the orphans and widows at the event.
