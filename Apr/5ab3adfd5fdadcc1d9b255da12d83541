Plateau State Deputy Governor Sonnie Tyoden, Thursday, declared his interest to contest for the governorship of the state to succeed Governor Simon Lalong come 2023. Tyoden, who made his declaration in Jos, the state capital, also briefed his state party leadership led by the party chairman, Rufus Bature, on his aspiration. “My aspiration is partly motivated by the burning desire to sustain and possibly expand the frontiers of the legacies of the rescue administration in the state led by Governor Simon Lalong. “Governing a state that is as diverse as Plateau State requires one with good sense of tact, strategic and critical thinking to build robust social cohesion and harmony among the diverse social elements as a necessary precondition for sound and effective governance,” he said.
