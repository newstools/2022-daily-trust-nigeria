The 2019 National Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) State Train the Trainers Team Leaders, has called on the leadership of the party to reintegrate them into its structures. National Coordinator of the forum, Mr Uche Nnamani, made the call yesterday in Abuja during a news conference its organized in conjunction with the Progressives Grassroots Mobilizers. He emphasised that the decision, if adopted, would enhance the party’s presence at the grassroots and ultimately lead it to victory in the coming 2023 general Elections. He said the forum’s members were never considered or included in any party’s committees or at government level, since the 2019 general elections. “Our journey which started in 2018 in the run-up to the last general elections, saw President Muhammadu Buhari personally inaugurating us, and charged us to move to the grassroots so as to ensure the party’s victory. “We went to work with no financial mobilisation, banking on the words of the president. But three years after spending our hard-earned resources, and putting our lives on the line, we are yet to be considered for integration into the party’s scheme of things,” he said.
