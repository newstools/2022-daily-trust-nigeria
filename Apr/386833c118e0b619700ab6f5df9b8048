Two Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains have picked the nomination and expression of interest forms to challenge the incumbent Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, in 2023. Even though Borno State was seen as the enclave of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the two aspirants are hoping to dethrone the incumbent governor. The two aspirants, Muhammed Imam and Muhammed Ali, have purchased and submitted their forms that were sold at N21m. This report punctured the social media report that because of the performance of Zulum, nobody has picked the nomination forms of the PDP. However, the two aspirants will be facing an uphill task as the PDP has never ruled the state since the dawn of democracy in Nigeria in 1999. In 1999, Mala Kachalla was elected on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP), that was followed by Ali Modu Sheriff on the platform of the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2003. Senator Kashim Shettima was elected in 2011 under the APC and the present governor, Babagana Zulum, who was elected in 2019.
