Towards enhancing agriculture and the creation of jobs, Dangote Fertiliser Limited is set to train over one million farmers in the next three years. The training, which is part of the company’s agriculture extension services, will involve spot demonstrations, result demonstrations, field demonstrations and soil samples collections. Speaking during his presentation at the Dangote Group Special Day at the ongoing Enugu International Trade Fair, Mr Uchenna Nwankwo of Dangote Fertiliser, said the exercise was designed to instruct farmers on the best practices in fertiliser application. Earlier, the president of the Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ECCIMA), Mr Jasper Nduagwuike, praised the Dangote Group for sponsoring the trade fair, noting that indigenous conglomerate activities were making a great impact on the economic development of Nigeria.
