A 54-year-old woman, Blessing Mormah, has approached an Igando customary court, asking for the dissolution of her marriage due to her husband’s sexual incompetence. Mrs Mormah, a beautician, asked the court on Tuesday to dissolve her 25-year-old marriage, alleging that she was forced into it.

Also, we always quarrel, we fight too often and anytime we fight he will tell me to leave his house. “He forgets that quarrels abound in marriage and that no one is perfect. “I was fed up with this lifestyle so I moved out eventually.” She added that, “Also, his manhood is not working. When I found out, I took him to the hospital and drugs were prescribed for him but he never used them. He always said nothing was wrong with him. “Ok, if nothing is wrong, then perform your duty, but he cannot.” The husband, Mr David Mormah, was not in court to give his own account. The president of the court, Mr Koledoye Adeniyi, adjourned the case to May 12. (NAN)
