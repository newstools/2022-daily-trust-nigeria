Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a non-partisan and smart social network ‘Wardchat’ has been launched in Nigeria to connect voters from the same polling unit, ward, local government and state across the country. The App aims to digitize the electoral space for proximal relationships using the smallest electoral unit as a determinant during registration. At the launch of the App in Lagos, Wardchat Country Lead, Kunle Lawal, described the initiative as the world’s first social network purposely built for an electoral community. According to him, every polling unit is a community of voters that should connect and interact more as voters, no matter how dispersed they may be. He explained that the smart social network has custom features built on Nigeria’s electoral structure covering 36 states, the FCT, 774 LGAs, 8,000 wards and over 176,000 polling units across the country.
