Worried by the hike in price of staple food, the Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON) has urged stakeholders in the flour mill industry to support local farmers to produce wheat. Director General of SON, Mallam Farouk Salim made the call during an interview session after a brief meeting with stakeholders in the industry in Lagos, against the backdrop of the shortage of importation of wheat owing to the war between Russia and Ukraine. According to him, local production of wheat will alleviate the plight of consumers of wheat. “The ultimate plan is to do the same thing we did with rice where the local industry will encourage local farmers to produce the wheat, that way, we won’t have issues, whether there is issue or crisis somewhere else in the world. “So it’s important, we have a good grip of it early, so that we can cut down the prices that are already going up, because if it is not tackled, we will eventually have issues where local individuals in the country will not afford the staple food we have,” he said. The DG called for collaboration with the stakeholders in the industry in order to address issues facing the industry. The Vice president, Crown Flour Mill, Mr. Bolaji Anifowose, assured of the willingness to support the DG’s vison for the industry. He described the call for collaboration as a welcomed development.
