KIA Nigeria has unveiled Shatu Garko, the reigning Miss Nigeria as its brand ambassador after partnering with Folio Media Group, the pageant organiser. The brand ambassadorship comes on the heels of the presentation of an all-new KIA Rio to 18-year-old Shatu Garko, having won the 44th edition of the prestigious Miss Nigeria contest in December. Founder of Folio Media Group, the organizers of the pageant, Fidelis Anosike, said the vision was to create national empowerment and a role model that would serve as a driver for young women. “We want to use it to raise the voices of women. We believe that every Miss Nigeria will also take on these issues, raising the voices of women, especially as it relates to issues around the environment,” he stated. The Marketing Manager of KIA Nigeria, Olawale Jimoh, said, “As a socially responsible brand in Nigeria, we understand the various struggles of young ladies, particularly in Nigeria and so we strive to make sure our company supports organisations that uplift and support women in the country.” The newly signed KIA Ambassador, Shatu Garko said: “It’s great to be part of the KIA family; a leading global brand with deep knowledge and expertise in creating technologically advanced cars and exceptional after-sales service.”
