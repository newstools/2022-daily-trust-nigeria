The Emir of Agaie in Niger State, Alhaji Yusuf Nuhu, has rescued two girls from their parents who wanted to force them into early marriage. Nuhu disclosed this to newsmen shortly after a sensitisation campaign on Gender-Based Violence (GBV), on Saturday, in Agaie LGA of the state. Nuhu said the girls are currently in his custody and he has refused to release them to their parents until they allow the girls to marry men of their choice. “Here in my emirate, I preach against early and forced marriage. Currently, I have two girls under my custody whose parents wanted to force them into marrying men they didn’t love,” he said.
