 The wife of a late former Governor of Oyo State, Dr Florence Ajimobi, on Thursday, organised a meeting to resolve the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. She appealed to all the members of the party in the state to use the lesson learnt during the month of Ramadan and Easter to accept the decision of the leaders of the party. Speaking during the meeting, she said all the members had agreed to revisit all the faulty processes in electing the executive members of the party in order to make a valid resolution. In separate interviews, the state Chairman of the party, Isaac Omodewu, and a leader of the party, Senator Ayoade Adeseun, said the two factions of the party in the state had agreed to work together for the interest of the party.
