Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has said the proposal for the constitution of an interim administration after the expiration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure can give room for anarchy. The governor said this Tuesday while fielding questions from reporters after a closed-door meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. A legal luminary and founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), Aare Afe Babalola, had on Monday advised the federal government to suspend the 2023 elections to allow a six-month interim government after Buhari’s tenure. But the governor of Imo State, while reacting to a question on the suggestion, said Nigeria’s constitution has no room for an interregnum and wondered how the interim government would arise if there was no election to replace the current administration. The “constitution is like a bible. Some of us who are Christians, the Bible is the manager of our faith. So, the constitution should be the instrument guiding our actions as a country. “If you think there is an opinion that is worthy to be canvassed as superior to what is in the Nigerian constitution, such opinion should be taken to the National Assembly and they will through due process amend our constitution to factor in such opinion,” he said.
