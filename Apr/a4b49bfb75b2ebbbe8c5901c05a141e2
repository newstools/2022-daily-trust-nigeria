The Zamfara State Government has cautioned residents of the state against indiscriminate and unauthorised use of the cellphone number of Governor Bello Matawalle. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday by Mr Zailani Bappa, the governor’s special adviser on public enlightenment, media and communications. The statement reads in part: “The intention of His Excellency to allow his personal telephone numbers to dwell in the public domain is for effective monitoring of security matters and for grassroots developmental issues. Terrorists can be exterminated in 6 months – Retired Generals Osun Muslims kick over re-allocation of Eid prayer ground to pastor “He has also made it a habit to monitor social media and online media to personally feel the pulse of the people. “This is to further shape the priorities of his administration according to the wishes and aspirations of the people. “However, some careless people have more than once abused this privilege by adding His Excellency’s number to irrelevant social media platforms without permission.” He, therefore, advised individuals wishing to add the governor’s number to any social media platform to seek permission from the office of the special adviser, directorate of public enlightenment, media and communications.
