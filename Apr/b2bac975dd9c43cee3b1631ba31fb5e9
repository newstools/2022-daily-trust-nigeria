The Kano State Government has commenced a 10-day waste removal exercise in its effort to ensure a cleaner and healthy environment. The exercise involves clearing the dumping sites in the metropolitan LGAs. Recently, residents of the metropolis lamented the rising number of refuse dumps on streets which cause havoc, leading to hold ups and health issues. Therefore, the ministry of environment in the state mobilised resources from some agencies and philanthropists to commence the clearance of the dumps. The commissioner for environment, Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, said the exercise, tagged, “Keep Kano Clean Week”, was to prepare for the rainy season to prevent flooding. He said this time around the state government received contribution of over 50 vehicles, including tippers and pay-loaders from some companies in the state to ease the exercise and hasten it. According to him, so far within the three days of the exercise, over 30 dumping sites have been cleared and that the work is going on smoothly. While urging residents to comply with refuse management regulations in the state, the commissioner assured them that before the end of the exercise all dumping sites in the state would be cleared.
