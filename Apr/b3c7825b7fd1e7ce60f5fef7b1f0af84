Thirty four teachers in Kebbi State have been trained on self-management, my education, communication and literacy, team work, critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well efficient teaching ethics by two firms. The training which was organised by Skills Outside School Foundation in partnership with Women and Youth Initiative for Moral Awareness (WAYMA) was to help build the capacities of the teachers. In a statement, the organisations explained that the skills foundation had been working in the FCT and 15 other states over the years, and that the foundation concentrated more on the North West because of the challenges in that part. According to the bridge programme officer, Charles Jang, the training of teachers would enable students to be adequately prepared academically and be self-reliant. Earlier, the Skills Outside School Foundation’s board chair, Halima Ibrahim-Abba, said the annual training was aimed at improving teachers’/trainers’ capacities on efficient teaching ethics and professionalism in the teaching profession. Speaking on behalf of the participants, Ifeanyi Nwemeh, from Haliru Abdu Secondary School, Jega, said the training had helped them learn new skills, among others.
