Kola Abiola, son of the late acclaimed winner of the 1993 presidential election, MKO Abiola, has condemned zoning arrangement by top political parties, saying the best candidates should be allowed to contest elections. Kola, who was speaking on Arise TV’s programme, “One-on-One with Kola Abiola” on Friday, said candidates with the best intentions for Nigeria should be supported to occupy political positions. “The first thing Nigeria needs today is a President that signifies Nigeria, a person that is seen as a Nigerian first. If we solve that problem, all other things are solved,” he said. He said the youths were not concerned about the religion, ethnicity or region a candidate is from as long as he or she can do the job. “Look at the industries; music, creative arts, they don’t care where you come from, what they care about is someone that can move together. We have to bring that into politics,” Kola added. Kola, who joined the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) last week, said the party had no legacy of zoning. “No position is zoned in the party. We are looking for the best. I believe in having the best to do the job, who can relate with the teeming you, I don’t care whether he is Yoruba or from the East or North,” he stressed.
