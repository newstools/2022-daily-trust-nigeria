The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a young lady simply identified as Omotoyosi who reportedly raised a false alarm that she had been kidnapped and raped. Omotoyosi had posted a tweet on her twitter page @_misteriouss that she was being kidnapped and raped. The tweet posted at 7:15 am read, “I’m being kidnapped guys. I’m being raped. Number 78 Obayan Street Pako Akoka. Lagos.” She also went ahead to post the number of the person who allegedly kidnapped her. She later deleted the post and tweeted that it was false. “I tweeted earlier that I was kidnapped and raped. It’s false. I am so sorry for this. Please stop calling and threatening the numbers,” she wrote. She further disproved her claim in a video saying, “I am fine. I was not kidnapped or raped. I am fine and I am not making this video under duress or anything. I am very okay, I am in my house. Please stop calling or threatening those numbers. Thank you very much.” There has been outrage on social media following the tweet with many people condemning her action. One of her brothers, it was learnt, claimed she did it “to chase clout.” The spokesman for the Lagos State Police Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said the lady was being investigated. He said, the lady “is in our custody and the case is under investigation,” adding that she turned herself in.
