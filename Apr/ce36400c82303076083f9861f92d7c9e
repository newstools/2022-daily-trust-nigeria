A former Senate Minority Leader and governorship aspirant in Taraba State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Emmanuel Bwacha, has donated 16 vehicles to the party. The state chairman of the party, Barr Ibrahim El-Sudi, received the vehicles for onward distribution to the council areas during the swearing-in of the state executive of the party in Jalingo, Wednesday. El-Sudi commended Bwacha for the donation and called on other party members to do the same. He said although Bwacha is relatively new in the party, he has joined with full force and determination to uplift it in the state. In his address, Mr. Illiyasu Kirim, Director General of the Bwacha Campaign Organization, who presented the vehicles on behalf of the senator, said they were to ease movement for officials at the local government levels.
