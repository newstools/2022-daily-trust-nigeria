 The Kano State Government has commenced distribution of water to communities worst hit by scarcity. This is coming after several Daily Trust reports highlighting the challenges residents have been going through in accessing water, especially during the Ramadan. A 25-litre jerry can of water hitherto sold at N20 now goes for as much as N150 in some areas. City & Crime reports that Dandago in Sabon Titi is among the areas where the scarcity is biting hard, and as such was one of the areas supplied with water tanks where the residents, mainly children, lined up to collect the water in buckets and jerry cans. A 15-year-old girl, Zainab Ahmad, told City & Crime that she got three buckets of the water for her mother. A boy, Sanusi Bashir, said he got five buckets for his family. However, it was gathered that some smaller children could not get the water as the older ones pushed them out of the queues. A 12-year- old boy, who simply identified himself as Ahmad, told City & Crime that he could not get the water as he could not struggle with the older ones. Ahmad said, “I came here as early as possible but I could not get even a drop of water because the older ones have been pushing us out of the queue.” While some residents lauded the information, others expressed dissatisfaction with the distribution, saying the water was not enough for them, and called on the state government to find a lasting solution to the prolonged shortage of water in the state.
