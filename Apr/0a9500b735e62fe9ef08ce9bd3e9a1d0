 The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (CIPM) said it has recorded an increase in its operating surplus with a surplus of N132 million. That is an increase of three per cent compared to N121m it made in 2020, the institute stated yesterday, adding that the president and chairman of council, Olusegun Mojeed, had been re-elected. Mojeed, who spoke at the 53rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the institute held virtually, also disclosed that the institute had commenced the establishment of the CIPM tribunal to address the raging issues of bullying in the workplace and how to deal with “toxic bosses”. Mojeed further said, “However, we were able to record an increase in surplus. This we did despite a 15.63 per cent inflation rate in the country as at December, 2021. “In 2021, we made a total surplus of N132,000,000 – a three per cent increase compared to N121,000,000 in 2020. However, some revenue heads in the financial statement show a reduction in 2021 when compared to 2020,” he noted.
