The zoning committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is presently locked in a crucial meeting over which side of the country should produce the presidential candidate of the party. The meeting which is taking place at the Benue state governor’s lodge, Abuja, is said to be presided over by the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom. The ongoing meeting is very crucial because the 37-member committee is expected to come out with the outcome of its deliberations. Meanwhile, barring any last-minute change of strategy, the committee is expected to throw the contest for the sole ticket of the party open. The meeting which started at about 12 pm is still ongoing as at the time of filing this report. The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP after its last meeting recommended the composition of a 37-member Zoning Committee to trash out the vexed issue threatening to polarise members of the party. This was after the caucus and the National working committee (NEC) of the party failed to come to a compromise on the way forward. The committee was inaugurated by the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, with a charge to put the unity of the party and quest to win the presidential election upper most in their minds during deliberations.
