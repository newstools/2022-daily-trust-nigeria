The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is open to direct primaries, indirect primaries and consensus, for its presidential candidate in 2023, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, its chairman, has said. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed a deadline of June 3 for political parties to present their candidates. Speaking with State House correspondents shortly after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Adamu said any of the options are available for the ruling party. “When we get there, we’ll talk, alright? But the options are there; direct primaries, indirect and consensus. The party has a choice which of these paths to take.” On the March 26 national convention that made him the national chairman, Adamu said, “Since the history of democracy in this country; First Republic, Second Republic, up to where we are today, I don’t remember any convention, the size we held. “I don’t remember any convention that there were misgivings about the possibility of its success other than this one. We came out clean and we thought the leadership that Mr President provided the party has made all this possible.” He added that having spent a week in office already, he considered it important to pay a thank-you visit to the President. “Since the end of the Convention on March 26, we’ve not come to meet with him to thank him for providing leadership for the party to have a successful Convention. “The opportunity came today. So, I came with my predecessor to come and touch base with the President and, with gratitude, inform him that we have fully handed over. “I’m in charge of this party, by the grace of God and we will take the trust that is placed on us with every sense of patriotism,” he said. Buhari charged the ruling party chairman to be fair and firm.
