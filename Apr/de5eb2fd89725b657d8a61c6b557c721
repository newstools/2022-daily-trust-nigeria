The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) has urged Muslim women to be wary of politicians who engage in vote buying. The JNI Secretary-General, Sheik Khalid Aliyu Abubakar, stated this yesterday at the 2022 Annual Prayer organized by the Federation of Muslim Women’s Association of Nigeria (FOMWAN), in Jos, Plateau State. The Islamic cleric warned the women not to indulge in double registration as doing so would disqualify them from participating in the election. He also urged them to vote for the candidates of their choice during the 2023 general elections. He said: “The 2023 election is around the corner. The most important thing is for everyone to get their PVCs because without the PVCs, you are not qualified to vote during the election. And for those who have reached the age of 18 and above, they are qualified to be registered. “I urge you to go and register now. You can only get good representation if you have PVCs and vote the right person. When the election comes, don’t allow any politician to buy your vote. Your vote is your education, security and good governance.”
