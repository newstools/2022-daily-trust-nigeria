The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the public confession by Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has vindicated its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knows the “whereabouts and plans” of the terrorists but deliberately refused to act. The party, in a statement, also said the revelation by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirms that the APC administration has been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country. Debo Ologunagba, spokesman of the party, said in exposing the APC government which he is part of, El-Rufai had said, “we know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report…” In his confession, the minister of Transportation said “We knew what the problems will be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment…I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost… When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying.” The party said these revelations from high-ranking APC officials who are in the position to know are troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.
