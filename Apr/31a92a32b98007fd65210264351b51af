A fire incident averted at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) branch in Makurdi, the Benue State capital on Thursday was from a fuel dump behind the bank’s building. The reports of the incident filtered on social media in the morning. However, the CBN Director, Corporate Communications, Mr Osita Nwanisobi, in a statement, confirmed the cause of the incident as he said: “Reports indicate that the fire started from the fuel dump behind the branch building sending smoke into the atmosphere.  Fortunately, there were no liabilities and the affected site has since been cordoned off for further investigation. Normal work has also continued at the branch.” Nwanisobi noted that the minor fire incident was quickly checked by the facility managers, the CBN security personnel and with support from the Benue State Fire Service. “A minor fire occurred at the CBN Makurdi branch at about 7 am and was quickly checked moments after it was detected. The prompt response of the bank’s security and facility management units as well as the support from the Benue State Fire Service helped to fight the fire and prevented any damage the fire might have caused to the main office building,” said the CBN official.
