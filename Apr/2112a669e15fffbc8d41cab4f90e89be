There was confusion at the congress of the Imo State chapter of Social Democratic Party (SDP) as the delegates exchange blows following a disagreement. It was gathered that trouble started when the chairman of the party, Owerri. zone, Chidiebere Oja, insisted that the congress would not go on following the suspicion that some members of the party were working with other parties to hijack it. He and other party members, who had gathered at the Wethral Road secretariat of the party for the congress, insisted that the exercise must be suspended. The disagreement degenerated as the members threw chairs and any nearby objects at each other. They asked the staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) invited for exercise to leave. The Oguta LGA chairman, Chidi Oziri and his Okigwe LGA counterpart, Nwankwo Maduka, had a serious shouting match. The altercations between the two chieftains drew the attention of their supporters, with each group trying to defend their leader. The state chairman of the party, Mr. Ben Anochie, who spoke to newsmen, said the exercise had to be suspended to restore order.
