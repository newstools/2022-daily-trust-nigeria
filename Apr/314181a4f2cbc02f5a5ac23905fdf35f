The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the Continuous Voter Registration Exercise (CVR) exercise in Ihitte Uboma LGA of Imo State, over the killing of an official following an attack by gunmen. This is sequel to a report by the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Emeka Ezeonu, that a staff of the Imo State office of the commission involved in the ongoing CVR exercise, Mr Nwokorie Anthony, was shot dead by gunmen at Nkwo Ihitte (PU 004) in Amakohia Ward (RA 02) of Ihitte Uboma LGA. A National Commissioner of INEC and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said on Thursday in Abuja that the REC further reported that the state office is making efforts to locate the whereabouts of two remaining staff involved in the registration exercise. He urged the president generals of the various town unions in Imo State as well as all other critical stakeholders to protect the staff of the commission engaged in national assignment. He said, “The safety and security of staff are of paramount importance to the commission, particularly with the devolution of the voter registration exercise beyond our state and local government area offices in our determination to serve Nigerians better.”
