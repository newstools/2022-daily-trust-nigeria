Air Peace has announced moving its international flight operation to the new terminal of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos, becoming the first to do so. The new terminal was commissioned nearly a month ago, built by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). The airline operated its 7:00hrs Lagos-Accra flight from the terminal on Tuesday, April 19, 2022, Daily Trust reports. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said Air Peace had notified the flying public that from April 19, 2022, its international and regional flight departures would be at the Terminal 2 of the airport. Olisa’s statement reads in part: “We are delighted to be the first airline to operate a flight at the newly commissioned MMIA Terminal 2, and going forward, all our regional and international departures will be from this new terminal. We commend the federal government for the feat, and Air Peace will continue to blaze the trail.” Olisa added that passengers flying to Accra, Banjul, Freetown, Douala, Dakar, Johannesburg and Dubai were henceforth expected to proceed to the new terminal for ticketing, check-in and boarding. He added that, “Our ground personnel are ready to assist the passengers to ensure they seamlessly adjust to this new development.”
