A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Mr Peter Obi, has said he is not desperate to be president but is eager to see Nigeria work when he takes over the mantle of leadership of the country. Mr Obi, a two-term governor of Anambra State and vice presidential candidate of the PDP in 2019, stated this on Wednesday when he visited Bayelsa State governor, Douye Diri, in Yenagoa. Daniel Alabrah, Governor Diri’s spokesman, quoted Mr Obi in a statement as saying that Nigeria was a great country with untapped potentialities which he was desperate “to move the nation away from a consumption economy to a productive one.” He stressed that Nigeria was not working because of its unproductive state, which he said was unacceptable to the nation’s young, intelligent and smart population. The presidential hopeful, who reeled out the statistics of agricultural value chain to Nigeria’s economy as against oil revenue, decried the level of neglect of food production in the country. In his remarks, Gov Diri said Obi proved his worth while he served as governor of Anambra, especially when he saved and handed over N75bn to his successor.
