All Progressives Congress (APC) members in the Adamawa State House of Assembly have raised N25 million to purchase nomination form for a governorship aspirant, Abdurrazaq Namdas. Namdas, who is the member representing Toungo, Ganye, Jada and Mayobelwa Federal Constituency, Adamawa State had commenced state-wide consultation on his governorship ambition. The Adamawa State lawmakers are Abdullahi Ahmed Manager, Abdullahi Umar Nyako and Alhassan Hammanjoda. Speaking, Hammanjoda appealed to other state lawmakers to support the aspirant. He said the Toungo, Ganye, Jada and Mayobelwa federal constituency had never produced a governor after Bamanga Tukur who occupied the office for only three months. Extolling the leadership qualities Namdas possessed, Hammanjoda said the aspirant’s performance as federal legislator in the last four years had testified to his ability and commitment to progressive leadership. Represented by his Senior Legislative Aide, Hussaini Sanda at the meeting, Namdas thanked the three legislators, a group of senior citizens from the chiefdom as well as the Namdas Support Group for contributing money for purchase of nomination form for him.
