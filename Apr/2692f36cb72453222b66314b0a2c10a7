A 12-year-old girl who was raped by an Islamic teacher in June, 2021, at Unguwan Fantaro in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State has given birth, City & Crime learnt yesterday. Halima (not real name), who used to hawk chin-chin (buns), was lured by the Islamic teacher, Salihu, on the guise of buying chin-chin of N200. Inside his room, adjacent a tsangaya (Qur’anic school) where he teaches, Salihu covered Halima’s mouth and raped her. City & Crime recalls that three months after the incident, it was discovered that she was pregnant and was subsequently taken into custody by the Kaduna State Ministry of Human Services and Social Development through and NGO, Ummulkhairi Foundation. Confirming her delivery, the commissioner for human services and social development, Hajiya Hafsat Baba, said, “The little girl gave birth to a baby boy three weeks ago, and I am happy the doctors at Barau Dikko Hospital were able to manage her well to give birth on her own rather than her going through a caesarean section (CS).”
