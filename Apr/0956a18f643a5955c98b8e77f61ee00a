 The Bayelsa West Youth Congress has said that a group of politicians and their cronies who are deliberately twisting history to confuse and create needless tension among the people of Bayelsa West Senatorial District on a purported zoning arrangement in the area is out to disenfranchise the former governor of the state and incumbent Senator for the zone, Chief Henry Seriake Dickson from exercising his constitutional right. The National Coordinator of the Group, Comrade Ebide Brown, said in a statement on Tuesday that what had happened over the years in the senatorial district is a healthy contest of political parties pairing up candidates with the potential to win elections in the two local government councils making up the district. He lamented that the whole noise about zoning is a mischievous attempt by a group of politicians to make a sacrilegious attempt to disenfranchise Senator Henry Seriake Dickson from participating in the next election.
