 The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is determined to improve the well-being of persons with autism and other neurological disorders to enable them live normal lives. The FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, said this following a surprise visit he paid to Brain Bloom Centre, Apo, Abuja, a centre dedicated to the care of children with special needs and at the forefront of creating awareness on autism, yesterday. Speaking after a tour of facilities at the centre, the minister corroborated the founder of the centre on the imperative for the creation of awareness about the disorder, even as he pledged continued support of the FCTA. Stressing the need for awareness on the autism disorder, Malam Bello said, “I am very happy that you created a forum where parents of the autistic students can come and share ideas, because we realise in life that anything that happens had happened before. So, sometimes, if you share ideas, you will be able to achieve the aim of finding solutions to any challenge.” On the need for an inclusive environment, the minister revealed that the FCTA was working on making public buildings to conform with the Disability Act recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari so as to cater for persons with disabilities and other special needs. According to him, this, coupled with the planned installation of lifts at the rail stations, would provide easy access and movement to persons with disabilities in the facilities. In a welcome remark earlier, the centre’s founder and managing director, Mrs Rahanatu Yusuf, appealed for greater understanding, patience and acceptability of autistic persons to build a much more inclusive world that protects the rights of all children, particularly those with neuro-diversity. She called on governments at all levels and citizens not to forget the vulnerable populations and to implement the Disability Act and establish proper diagnostic centres.
