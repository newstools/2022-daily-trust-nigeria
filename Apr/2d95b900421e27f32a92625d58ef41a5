The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says it will apprehend motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the Easter. The Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr Ahmed Umar, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Ota, Ogun. Umar said some motorists were likely to indulge in drinking alcohol, which would make them disobey traffic rules and regulations on the highways during the festive season. “So, the FRSC personnel would be all out across the state to checkmate driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. “In addition, the FRSC would impose strict punishment on any motorist apprehended or caught driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs,” he said
