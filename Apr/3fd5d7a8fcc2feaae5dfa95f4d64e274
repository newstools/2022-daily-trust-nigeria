A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Katsina State, Senator Abubakar Ya’Ardua, has declared that if elected, he would personally lead the war against terrorism and other crimes in the state. Yar’adua made the declaration Tuesday in Katsina while addressing supporters shortly after notifying APC state executives of his intention to join the race. In the address tagged “A clarion call to Katsinawa and Daurawa” Yar’adua also promised to create at least 100,000 direct and indirect jobs for the youths annually, as part of efforts to tackle unemployment. “We need to quickly come to the rescue of our state and salvage it from current security challenges and economic quagmire – both of which are results of decades of utter neglect of the teeming Talakawa (the poor) that constitute more than 99% of our state’s population, by those who should serve them. “Most significantly, we plan to confront the current insecurity challenges head-on. Our people must not only be secured but must be seen to be and feel totally secure,” he said.
