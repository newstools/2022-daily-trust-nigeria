No fewer than 500 people living with disabilities and beggers have benefited from Iftaar meal donated by a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Dr Abdulfattah Durojaiye, in Kano. The distribution of the meal, which took place at different locations in Kano metropolis, targeted major begging spots and people with disabilities. Speaking during the distribution, the leader of the entourage, Hajiya Khadiya Abubakar, said Dr Durojaiye was known for his humanitarian activities and helping the less privileged to enjoy their stay in the world. She said if given the opportunity, the presidential aspirant would alleviate the suffering of the masses, provide employment, reduce poverty rate and fight the lingering security challenges. She said, “The motive behind this gesture is to reduce the burden among the less privileged. So far we shared Iftaar meal to over 500 people, and it will continue. The kind of smile in the faces of the people receiving the gesture is overwhelming, hence the need to continue.” Some of the beneficiaries thanked and prayed for Dr Durojaiye to fulfill his ambition.
