The Gombe Geographic Information System (GOGIS) has commenced house enumeration to enhance decision making under the State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) project coordinated by the World Bank. In a statement yesterday, the Director-General, Dr Kabiru Usman Hassan, who spoke during the launch, said the SFTAS project is to strengthen the fiscal capacity of the 36 states of the federation. The DG stressed that this was to allow informed decisions, especially when bringing social amenities closer to the people. Dr. Hassan also stated that the project will provide a seamless window for the people of Gombe to register their landed properties in order to obtain a secured digital certificate of occupancy. The enumeration exercise aims to capture detailed information about our various localities to form data that will help assess the adequacy of provisional infrastructure and social amenities. “The ongoing enumeration exercise will help the state implement the plan, especially since the data collected will highlight the various geographic areas that require certain basic amenities over others.  It will also help Gombe State provide an enabling environment for social and human development thereby boosting its socio-economic activities to the greater peaks.”
