The House of Representatives Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, has summoned the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), the Bureau for Public Enterprises, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) and others over the stalemate in the renewal of expired lease agreements of five terminal operators. The Concession for the five terminal operators amounted to N211.9 billion. Chairman of the Committee, Kolade Victor Akinjo gave the directive after a resolution on a motion moved by Benjamin Ben, which was seconded and adopted. It could be recalled that the committee had on March 4th given the transport ministry two weeks to renew the expired lease licences. Speaking, the chairman reminded that, the committee had earlier deliberated with all the chief executives of the five terminals with expiring leases as well as the ministry of transport, ICRC, BPE and resolved that, they should proceed and conclude the renewal of the lease agreements in line with Article (2) of their respective concession agreements. The chairman noted that concession for ENL Consortium was $143 million, Port &Cargo Handling Services $120 million, Josepdam Port Services $100 million while the Concession fee for Associated Marine Services was $2.4 million which brings the total to $365.4 million, equivalent to N211.9 billion. He added: “We also understand that the five (5) Terminal operators have also agreed to pay a renewal fee ranging from $1 million to $5 million as soon as the Supplemental Agreements are executed. “The committee is concerned that, all these investments will not come into our Ports without a substantive agreement”.
