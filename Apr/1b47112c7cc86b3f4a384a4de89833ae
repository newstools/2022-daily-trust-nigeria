The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has denied resuming the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in places where the exercise was earlier suspended in Imo State. National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee of INEC, Festus Okoye, said on Tuesday in Abuja that such a report is misleading. Daily Trust reports that the state Governor, Hope Odikaka Uzodinma, last week said that INEC has lifted the suspension following coordinated attacks on INEC officials and registrants by gunmen who disrupted the exercise. “This is misleading. It will be recalled that following the unfortunate incident in Imo State in which our staff was killed by gunmen in Ihitte Uboma LGA and reports of insecurity in other parts of the state, the commission suspended the ongoing voter registration exercise in all the 54 additional centres created to facilitate the registration of voters across the state. “The exercise is still confined to our state and Local Government Area offices except in Orsu, Njaba and Ihitte Uboma Local Government Areas where it is suspended indefinitely. The position of the commission has not changed,” Okoye said. He said that while the commission is not unmindful of the imperative of giving every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register and vote in future elections, the safety and security of citizens involved in the exercise is a paramount concern.
