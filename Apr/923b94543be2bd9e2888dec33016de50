The management of Coleman Cables and Wires has said the company has the capacity to solve the problem of incessant collapse of the nation’s national grid with the investment of N30 billion in the production of GAP cables. The managing director/CEO of Coleman, Mr George Onafowokan, disclosed this while reacting to the recent collapse of the national grid.

Coleman has positioned itself to help Nigeria out of this problem that has thrown millions of people into darkness. “Coleman has committed $50m investment which will in return create direct and indirect 100,000 jobs. The federal government should allow us to solve this problem once and for all with the production of transmission cables that would put an end to the incessant collapse of the national grid.” He stressed that Coleman was ready to work with the federal government, the ministry of power and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to ensure that Nigerians enjoyed steady power supply, with the supply of one of the latest technology-driven power conductor, GAP Cable, that had the capacity to carry more load than existing cables.
