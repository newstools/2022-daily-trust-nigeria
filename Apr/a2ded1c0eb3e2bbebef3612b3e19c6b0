A coalition of about 70 youth groups drawn from the Northwest region under the auspices of ‘Arewa Youth Alliance for Emefiele’ has called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr Godwin Emefiele to join the presidential race. Across the country, hundreds of groups have been pushing the CBN governor to join the presidential race. Speaking, the team leader of the youth alliance, Kabir Mukhtar Hussein, made the call at the unveiling and launching of the movement in Kano. He said the reason behind the unanimous support for Emefiele to run for the presidency was his exceptional track record and contributions, especially in the agricultural sector and the economy in general. Similarly, the Unified Northern Youth Forum has described Emefiele as the best candidate to succeed Buhari because of his experience in the economic sectors. Addressing politicians and youth in Sokoto State, the director-general of the forum, Dr Ibrahim Bature, said they are mounting pressure on the CBN governor because of the successes recorded in the agriculture sector through his initiatives.
