The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has said the country is targeting N12.4 trillion ($30 billion) in the next five years from non-oil commodities. NEPC’s North Central coordinator, Mr Samson A. Idowu, disclosed this during the inauguration of the Plateau State committee on the export promotion of agricultural products from the state known as State Committee on Export Promotion (SCEP). The inauguration was convened not only to fulfil the statutory requirement of holding quarterly meetings of SCEP, but to also intensify the drive towards the realisation of the One-State-One-Product (OSOP) initiative of the federal government. Mr Idowu said, “The target of the federal government is that we are expecting $30bn revenue from non-oil commodities. In the next five years, the country will begin to realise that under OSOP from all the states of the federation. “So, each state would be contributing from one product. In Plateau State, we have chosen potato to achieve that mandate. Different states have chosen different commodities. We are serious about it, and those products would be able to generate $30bn revenue for the country. In his remarks, the commissioner for commerce and industry in the state, Gambo Idris, noted that the project was one of the solutions to the Nigerian problem, saying, “Export should be one of their (SCEP) immediate concern, especially at this critical moment when oil is no longer paying off. And the export should be largely on non-oil commodities.
