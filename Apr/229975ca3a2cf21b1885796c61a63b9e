Against the backdrop of some influential members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) claiming that they have the blessing of the highest hierarchy of the party to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, Senator Magnus Abe has said the president has not anointed any successor. Abe said as a staunch member of APC and one of the leaders of the party in Rivers State, “President Buhari has not anointed anybody to succeed him in 2023. I am an APC member and I am not aware that anybody has been mandated to go about telling people that he has been anointed to succeed the President. That is misinformation”.

He said some of those clamouring to become president have never cared to bring votes to the party, but were going about misinforming Nigerians that they have been anointed by the president to succeed him. Addressing his teeming supporters at the Freedom House (his campaign office) in Port Harcourt, on Monday, Abe charged party faithful in the state to continue to mobilize people for the forthcoming elections.
