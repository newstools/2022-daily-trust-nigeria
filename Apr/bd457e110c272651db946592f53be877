The 27 European Union member states have agreed to send another €500 million in military aid to Ukraine. Top EU Diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced on Wednesday in a statement. Borrell said it was crucial the EU increased military support to Ukraine as Russia gears up for a new assault, noting that “the next weeks will be decisive.’’ It is the third package of military aid the EU has agreed to send to Ukraine to defend itself amid the Russian invasion. In total, the EU has sent €1.5 billion in military aid. However, in February and March, the EU had announced two previous tranches of military aid, each worth €500m, in a historic first for the bloc to arm a non-EU member under attack. (NAN)
