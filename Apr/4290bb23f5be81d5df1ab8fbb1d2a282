An Australia-based medical doctor and candidate of the African Democratic Congress(ADC) for the June 18, governorship poll in Ekiti State, Wole Oluyede, has promised that he will back local government autonomy if elected. Dr Oluyede said it would take concerted effort for Ekiti to stand up economically, with its over N88bn debt and N37.8bn indebtedness on retirees’ gratuity and arrears of salary. Oluyede, who spoke in Ikere-Ekiti yesterday during an interactive session with newsmen on his programmes for Ekiti people, declared that he hoped to win the governorship. Condemning how the governors had been opposing local government autonomy, Oluyede said, “Why are local governments not autonomous? If government is local, then development should be local.
