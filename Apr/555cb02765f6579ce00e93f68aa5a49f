A mechanic, Kesmon Samuel, a resident of Yelwa town of Shendam Local Government Area of Plateau State, has explained why he returned N2 million he found on his way to his garage. According to the man, what first came to his mind when he found the money was to look for the owner of the money, adding that he did not hesitate to return the money to the owner. He said it was not morally good to hold the money and therefore he waited for the owner to make a claim. He said, “When I was going to the garage, I found the money in a black leather. I took the money and waited around the area; believing that the owner must come around to look for it. And if I didn’t see the owner, I would have taken the money to my master at the garage so that it would be taken to the mosque for further announcement. “Moment later, I saw someone coming, looking left and right. He was so disturbed. I then asked him what was the problem and he replied that he had lost his money along that road. I then asked how much was the money, and he said it was N2m. We counted the money and discovered that it was N2m and then I gave him his money. “He dashed me N50,000, but I refused to collect it. I decided not to collect it because I don’t know what will happen to me tomorrow. I am a Christian but the person that trained me is a Muslim. He trained me not to cheat anybody. “My friends called me all sort of names. They abused me for returning the money. Some even said I would never be rich.”
