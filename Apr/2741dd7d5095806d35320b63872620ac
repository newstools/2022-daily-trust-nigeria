A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Tuesday, restrained the Edo State Government from conducting the local government council election scheduled for April 19. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a ruling on an ex-parte motion moved by counsel for the applicants, Dr Joshua Musa, SAN, granted the five prayers sought. Justice Taiwo held that he was of the well-considered view that the defendants must, in the interim, be restrained pending the hearing and determination of the substantive matter. Taiwo said that the ruling followed the exparte motion with six exhibits attached. The judge, who held that the applicants had shown the need to urgently grant the prayers, said that “irreparable damage would have been done to the applicants if not granted.” The judge, who made a consequential order that the defendants be served within seven days after the receipt of the enrolled order, adjourned the matter until April 14 for a hearing of the substantive motion. He said the hearing date would be subject to the Chief Judge of the court, Justice John Tsoho’s fiat that the matter is taken during FHC’s vacation. Reports that four members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo; Irene Enike Sylvester, Ayoboh Aloaye Francis, Edogun Aiyeki Toyin and Obioba Osabuohien Kelvin, had filed the ex-parte motion marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/423/2022 to seek for five prayers. They urged the court to make “an order of interim injunction restraining the 3rd defendant (EDSIEC), its agents, servants, officers, privies howsoever described from conducting elections into local government councils in Edo State on the 19 of April 2022 or any other date pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.
