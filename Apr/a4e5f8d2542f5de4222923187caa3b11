The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has trained 100 women and youths in Kaduna State on business skills development to enable them to become self-reliant. Speaking at the flag-off Ceremony of NDE/Nazeemmursaj Entrepreneurship Skills Development Training, the state’s acting Coordinator, Mrs Victoria Williams Dada, said the agency had already trained another set of 100 youths and women in December 2021. According to her, the training was developed as part of the efforts of the NDE to equip unemployed women and youths with professional and business skills, which would enhance their capacity to succeed in their chosen businesses. The acting coordinator said the emphasis of the training is keyed on educating the participants on how to write feasibility reports for their business and how to access funds from the government’s low-interest and flexible loans and also other financial institutions. “The directorate is achieving another milestone in partnering with Nazeemmursaj Nigeria Limited, Abuja for the training of another set of women and youth in the area of entrepreneurship skills development training,” she said.
