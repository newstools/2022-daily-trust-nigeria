The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kwara State, Malam Garba Attahiru Madami, has expressed disappointment that some political parties are encouraging their members to engage in double registration. Madami, who said this during a stakeholders meeting in Ilorin, noted that the punishment for engaging in such act is a year’s imprisonment and N1 million fine. “It is disappointing that some political parties are making their members do double registration; the punishment for double registration is a year’s imprisonment and a million Naira fine. “If you do double registration, your name will be deleted and you won’t be allowed to vote and there would be a special court to try electoral offenders, so be warned.” He, however, urged voters to transfer their registration from their previous locations to their current base. Madami assured that the commission will remain resolute in officiating for a free and credible election. He stressed further that with the new electoral act and new technology, rigging has been made impossible, adding that buying PVC will be useless as facial recognition technology will be deployed.
