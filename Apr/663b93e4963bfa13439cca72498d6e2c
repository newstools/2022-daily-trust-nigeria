A presidential aspirant on the platform of the opposition Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Patience Ndidi Key, has said Nigerians are scared of the word change because of the performance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last seven years. Key said the main political parties have run the country aground, adding that it is the turn of new set of persons with the right vision and idea to lead the country. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Wednesday, Key said, “What Nigeria needs is a visionary leader with what it takes to protect the people. “A leader with empathy, that has the political will to serve the people. Nigeria did not need a leader that is popular, a leader that is with the major political party.” She said Nigerians are now scared of the word change, because of the way it has been used and how it has turned out in the country, stressing that “We need leaders that are competent and experienced, that can develop human capacity and build infrastructure that works.”
