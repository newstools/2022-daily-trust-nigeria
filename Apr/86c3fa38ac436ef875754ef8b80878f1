The Kaduna State government has partnered with experts in the development of a data digitisation plan aimed at strengthening the coordination in the collection and use of data for evidence-based decision-making and development problems. The 2022 Kaduna Datathon is currently being implemented by the Kaduna State Bureau of Statistics (KDBS) in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGFl, and the Natview Foundation for Technology Innovation (NFTI) as a follow-up activity to the 2021 Click-On Kaduna Data Science Fellowship programme. The NFTI is basically to identify and build the capacity of no fewer than 100 young persons on data management to contribute to the policy development cycle and programme planning. Speaking at the 2022 Kaduna Datathon finals over the weekend where data hackers from across Nigeria convened and pitched their solutions, the Executive Director of NFTI, Nuradeen Maidoki, said Kaduna State government took a unique approach to solve the state’s numerous challenges in evidence-based decision-making. Maidoki said, “In a world of growing populations, scarce resources, changing demographics, and shrinking budgets, Kaduna State Government (KDSG) took a unique approach to solve the state’s numerous challenges by developing the Data Revolution plan aimed at strengthening the coordination in the collection and use of data for evidence-based decision-making. The Kaduna State Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Baloni, in her goodwill message at the occasion, said health brings wealth, adding that accurate and timely data is required to affect the life and well-being of the people as data helps to track productivity. At the end of the presentation from the selected hackers, team CORE HEALTH from Jos emerged as winners while Krocks Analytica from Kaduna and Alayaum Technologies from Jigawa emerged as first and second runners up.
