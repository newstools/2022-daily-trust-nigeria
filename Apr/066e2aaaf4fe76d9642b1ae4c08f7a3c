Cristiano Ronaldo has returned to Manchester United training. Ronaldo was granted compassionate leave and missed the 4-0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday night following the tragic death of his baby boy. He suffered the tragic loss of his baby boy earlier in the week and was understandably absent for the Liverpool game to be with his family. The 37-year-old was driven into United’s Carrington training complex this morning and it is understood took part in the full session. Ronaldo announced in October his partner, Georgina Rodriguez, was expecting twins. Their baby girl was born safely.
