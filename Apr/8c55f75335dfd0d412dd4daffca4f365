The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has said electricity consumers are not responsible “to purchase, replace or repair transformers, poles or other associated equipment used in the distribution of electricity.” Responding to questions on its twitter handle, the consumer regulatory agency, while quoting the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Investment in Electricity Networks Regulation, said Distribution Companies (DisCos) are to replace damaged infrastructures within 48 hours of official notification. “But if unable to do so, residents may agree on terms of replacement with the DisCo in accordance with the NERC Investment in Electricity Networks Regulation and get appropriate refund/compensation.” On buying meters, it said customers can decide to buy meters using the Meter Assets Providers (MAP) framework but that DisCos are responsible for refunding or compensating customers who paid for the meters. “The cost of the meter is to be reimbursed in 36 equal monthly payments using consumer-purchased energy credits,” it stated.
