A former governorship candidate of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2007 in Kaduna, Alhaji Sani Sha’aban, has joined the governorship race on the platform of the All Progressive Party (APC). He promised to build on the foundation laid by Malam Nasir El-Rufai, who has been piloting the affairs of the state since 2015. Politics of rotation in Nigeria, way forward Nigerian democracy: Entrenching exclusion! Declaring his ambition, yesterday, amid a mammoth crowd, Sha’aban said he believes Kaduna can be made better adding, “We want to see Kaduna develop, prosper and become the pride of all.” “Governor El-Rufai has raised the bar of leadership in Kaduna State with remarkable infrastructural and developmental initiatives. Indeed, Kaduna has never had it so well with visible imprints of dividends of democracy dotting the entire landscape of the state. “As a progressive and open-minded Nigerian, I consider it a golden opportunity and a chance to display my courage, rekindle my innovative instinct, showcase my character and offer myself to continue where Governor El-Rufai stops after the expiration of his tenure in 2023,” he said.
