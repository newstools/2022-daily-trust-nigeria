The Managing Director, Kano Road and Traffic Agency (KAROTA), Baffa Babba Danagundi, says he tendered his resignation but Governor Abdullahi Ganduje rejected it. In a chat with Daily Trust, Danagundi said Ganduje through Acting Governor Nasiru Gawuna, refused to let him leave the job. “It is true I tendered my resignation but the governor rejected it, hence, I have to take whatever he tells me.” ‘’The Governor has done a lot for me; he elevated me as Managing Director and did other things politically. ”Honestly, I will not go contrary to whatever decision the governor made on my resignation because he knows the best for me”, he said. It was gathered that the Acting Governor rejected the resignation of Danagundi on the orders of the governor who is currently in the United Arab Emirates. The Managing Director of the agency is one of the loyalists of Ganduje. He was with the governor in United Arab Emirates before coming back to the country on Sunday. He reportedly tendered his resignation early Monday to allow him contest an elective position in the forthcoming election as stated by the Electoral Law.
