The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-led Adamawa State House of Assembly has declared the seat of a member vacant for defecting to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The decision was taken at plenary presided over by the speaker, Aminu Iya Abbas, yesterday. The legislator, representing Michika Constituency, Joseph Ayuba, had announced his defection last week in his ward amid reports that another PDP legislator, Simon Isa (Song Constituency) had concluded plans to cross carpet to the APC to give the opposition party majority in the house. The House was inaugurated on May 29, 2019, with the PDP having 13 seats, APC 11, while the African Democratic Party (ADC) had one, but defections changed the composition to 13 and 12 for the PDP and APC respectively in the 25-member assembly. When contacted, Hon Ayuba said he left the PDP because he had been sidelined in party activities in his Michika Constituency while Governor Umaru Fintiri refused to work with him.
