President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met separately with the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal and his Kebbi State counterpart, Atiku Bagudu, at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, Abuja. Tambuwal, who is the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum, is one of the key contenders for the leading opposition party’s presidential ticket for next year’s election. Bagudu is the Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), a platform being used by the governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The visit of the governor of Sokoto State to the president came a few days after the PDP’s consensus arrangements among four northern presidential aspirants broke down. However, sources in the Presidency said the president only invited some governors their states share borders with the nation’s neighbouring countries.
