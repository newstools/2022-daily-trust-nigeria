The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole, has said he will repackage the ‘stomach infrastructure’ of former governor of the state, Ayo Fayose, if elected governor. Kolawole said he would promote and repackage the concept to make it a model in the delivery of democratic dividends to the populace. “It is not about eating amala and panla alone, or queuing on the streets to get food and money. I will modernise it. It is a good policy. Our people must enjoy the dividends of democracy. “Nothing stops a governor from giving out part of the food in the government house to feed the commoners,” he said in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, during a chat with journalists on the next poll. He also said the insecurity in the state was enough reason for residents to reject the candidate of the APC, Biodun Oyebanji, in the June 18, governorship election.
