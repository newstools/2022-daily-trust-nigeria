TotalEnergies and its partners have commissioned four projects in South-Eastern Nigeria, as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). They comprise a maternal and child referral centre, mammography centre and solar-powered treated borehole water facilities. A statement from TotalEnergies said the first project was a maternal and child referral centre built inside the General Hospital, Baraki, Arochukwu, Abia State. The project is a fully equipped maternal and child referral centre, complete with state-of-the-art facilities, including the main reception and waiting area of 30 persons sitting capacity, among others. TotalEnergies and partners also commissioned and handed over a mammography centre at the Imo State Teaching Hospital (IMSUTH). The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Prosper Success Ohanwawa, said the facility will help in early detection, which will, in turn, mitigate death cases arising from breast cancer, while Dr Ifeanyi Nwamba, Chief Medical Director, IMSUTH, said the provision of the facility by TotalEnergies and partners demonstrated a deep commitment to the state. The state-of-the-art facility includes the main reception and waiting area of 21 persons sitting capacity among others. The firm deployed 26 solar panels with a 25-year warranty lifespan for both Nawfia Anambra State and Nnebukwu, Oguta community in Imo State to ensure they have access to clean water. His Royal Highness of Nnebukwu autonomous community, HRH Eze John Ikechukwu Ezigwe appreciated TotalEnergies, NNPC and partners for siting such laudable projects in the community.
