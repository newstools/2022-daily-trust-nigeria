The Gombe State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended a former governor of the state, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, for his peaceful conduct when he returned to the state on Saturday. Daily Trust reports that the former governor was last Saturday received by thousands of his supporters during his first visit to the state since he left office three years ago. Addressing newsmen on Tuesday in Gombe, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Mr Moses Kyari, said the party was satisfied with the peaceful conduct of Dankwambo during and after the mini-rally to welcome him back. “Dankwambo left office on May 29, 2019, and stayed away from Gombe for almost three years. He visited the state last Saturday and Gombe APC noted with delight how he arrived at the Gombe International Airport and proceeded to the PDP secretariat in the state along with his supporters and other chieftains peacefully, without disturbing the public peace. “During the visit, we observed that his supporters conducted themselves in a peaceful manner, which was a sharp contrast to other politicians who during their visits to Gombe, brought in heavily armed thugs brandishing very dangerous weapons and caused massive mayhem as well as the destruction of public properties,” he alleged.
