From Yusufu Aminu Idegu, Jos  Governor of Rivers State and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Nyesome Wike, has said the only way to end banditry in Nigeria is to vote out the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023 and replace it with PDP. Wike stated this in Jos, the Plateau State capital, while addressing national PDP delegates from the state. He said: “Banditry was never known in Nigeria until APC came. The ruling party gave birth to banditry and since then Nigeria no longer enjoys peace. “The only project the ruling APC has given the people of Plateau State is banditry and killings. What you hear every day on the Plateau is death of 10, 20, 30, 100 people, this is unfortunate and unacceptable.” He called on the people of the state to ensure that the PDP takes over power in 2023 and save the state from total destruction. The governor further told the delegates that he was in Jos to inform them of his intention to contest for the office of the president, stressing that he was the only person who is credible and capable of clearing the mess caused by the APC’s monumental destructions. Earlier in his welcome address, the Plateau State Chairman of the PDP, Hon. Chris Adukuchili Hassan, said Wike has been a friend of the people of Plateau State. He said the Plateau delegates would consider Wike, stressing that it was payback time in view of the numerous assistance the Rivers governor had offered the party in the state.
