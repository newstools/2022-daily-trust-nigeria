The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has revalidated the services and products of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), noting that they meet consumer and regulatory requirements. SON, which is a regulatory body in Nigeria, audited and revalidated FCMB’s Quality Management System, ISO 9001:2015 certification, a statement from the bank yesterday revealed. ISO 9001:2015 certification, awarded to FCMB in 2018 by SON, is the internationally recognised certification for Quality Management System. In certifying the bank, it covered all departments and branches of the bank and reviewed how FCMB executed its Quality Management System (QMS) and how well the framework guaranteed continuous improvement and operational efficiency to meet customer and stakeholder needs consistently. According to SON, the bank accomplished full conformity in all aspects of operations and service delivery review, including leadership, policies, processes, and procedures in line with global best practices. The managing director of FCMB, Mrs Yemisi Edun, described it as another proof of the customer-centric focus of the bank, quality of offerings and overall commitment to best practices. She said, “This revalidation affirms our commitment to continuous improvement and the agile way we conduct business to meet the ever-changing needs of our esteemed customers. We will continue to live up to our pedigree as an organisation committed to excellence, professionalism, and best practices for the ultimate benefit of our customers and stakeholders.”
