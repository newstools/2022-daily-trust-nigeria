The Managing Director and CEO of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), Dr Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, may resign soon to join the Gombe gubernatorial race. A statement by the spokesman of the Distribution Company (DisCo), Ibrahim Sani Shawai, yesterday, dismissed reports that the KEDCO head was sacked due to financial mismanagement and incompetence. He said: “Now, Dr Gwamna has not resigned but in view of his political ambition to become the next governor of Gombe State, he will soon resign to face his political ambition based on the guidelines from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in order to commence full-scale political activities.” He also noted that announcing the sack of such high profile personality will be done through the board and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and not otherwise. “It is also good to note that Fidelity Bank has not in any way taken over the management and activities of KEDCO as it was insinuated by the online media.” Daily Trust could not verify this as sources in the DisCo and the power sector could not confirm that. However, this paper had reported earlier that the authority in the power sector has insisted that all DisCos and power firms whose investors head the assets must desist immediately. For instance, Gwamna is a board member of KEDCO and Kaduna Electric just as MD of Benin DisCo, Funke Osibodu, is the wife of Victor Osibodu who heads Vigeo, the core investor in the DisCo. Meanwhile, the KEDCO’s statement said Gwamna’s leadership made highly impressive achievements by building the company to one of the best DisCos in the country.
