 Residents of Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, have expressed concern over the continuous hike in food prices and other items in the state during the Easter period. The traders and consumers who spoke with our reporter during a market survey across markets in the state called on the government to act on the situation. According to Mrs Ayobola Gabriel, a housewife, a kilogramme of cow and goat meat now sells for N3,200 rising from N2,500 while an average goat sells for between N50,000 and N70,000. Kunle Aremu, a consumer, said “A chicken has gone up to N8,500 depending on the size”. Another customer, Sidikat Abdulsalam, said a basket of tomatoes now hovered between N20,000 to N22,000. “Before now, I bought it at N6,000 and N8,500; this is really on the high side and to top it all, about four pieces are sold for N200,” Abdulsalam said. Titilayo Olayinka, another consumer, also said she bought a custard bucket of garri between N1,000 and N1,300 depending on the brand. Mrs Alaro Aliya, a foodstuff seller at Oja Oba, said, the effect of the high cost of foodstuff is not only felt by the consumer but by the traders alike. Aliya said the sudden surge in foodstuff prices is not unconnected with the Easter celebration and the ongoing Ramadan fast. “Items that rose sharply include foreign rice previously sold at N32,000 now N36,500, tin milk from N4,800 to N6,400 and vegetable oil now sold at N30,000 from N26,000”, she said. A yam seller in the Oja Oba market, who simply identified herself as Iya Sule Onisu, said “The size of yam sold at N2,000 before is now goes for N4,000.
