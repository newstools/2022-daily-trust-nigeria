A professor of political economy, Pat Utomi, has initiated a coalition under the auspices of the “Big Tent” to form an alliance with political parties ahead of the 2023 general elections. Utomi, who spoke at the meeting of the group at the Aso Radio’s Katampe Hill premises in Abuja, said the “Big Tent” had a membership list that surpassed the number of Nigerians that voted in the 2019 general elections. He said, “What we have tried to do is to bring together social movements, political parties; we are trying to bring together vast cooperatives, including the labour. “In the next week or so, we will choose one or the other to be the one that everybody who wants to come into for the big office would come out of. “But we have the Big Tent framework that includes the ADC, PRP, NRM and others. We will present one presidential candidate from this coalition. It has happened in Zambia, Kenya and other African countries, it can happen here and we will do that.” At the meeting, a member of the group and former member of the House of Representatives, Dr Usman Bugaje, warned that Nigerians would be plunged into further doom if those he described as ‘big men politicians’ were allowed to stay in office beyond 2023. “Things can only be done by those who have the knowledge, honesty and competence irrespective of tribe or religion. We must agree on the character, emotion and knowledge of the people we would put at the helm of affairs of the country,” he said.
