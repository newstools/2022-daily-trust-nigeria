President Muhammadu Buhari has confirmed Engr. Sule Ahmed Abdulaziz as the substantive Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. This is coming about 23 months after Abdulaziz was named acting MD of the company. According to a statement by TCN spokesperson, Ndidi Mbah, on Wednesday, TCN recorded critical milestones under his watch along with four Executive Directors, bringing to bear his over 25-years of engineering experience and responsibility as a project manager. His flagship strategy was the execution of the Nigeria Electricity Grid Maintenance, Expansion and Rehabilitation Programme (NEGMERP) to guide the execution of capital and reinforcement projects across the transmission regions in the country while still giving priority to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure. Some core power projects he led included the Abuja feeding scheme project which consists of a 330kV line, two 330/132kV, and three 132kV transmission substations slated for commissioning by September; the World Bank – sponsored NETAP project is progressing as 15 power transformers were imported by TCN recently, a very significant achievement in the history of the power sector in Nigeria. Abdulaziz who holds a Master of Science in Electronics/Automation Engineering from the Technical University in Sofia, Bulgaria, has also been the Chairman of the Executive Board of the West African Power Pool (WAPP) since 2020, flagging off the North Core transmission project that will interconnect Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria for cross-border electricity trade.
