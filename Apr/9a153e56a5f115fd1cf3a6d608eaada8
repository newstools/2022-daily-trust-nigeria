To promote export growth in the country, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) is set to hold the first national conference on non-oil exports. The conference, which will be anchored on the theme “Export for survival: Optimising Nigeria’s non-oil export potentials,” is expected to draw stakeholders in the non-oil sector to aggregate ideas aimed at promoting growth and the development of the sector. Addressing the media in Abuja on Wednesday, the Executive Director/CEO of the NEPC, Dr. Ezra Yakusak said: “The conference is crucial to showcase the export potentials of Nigeria by exhibiting various non-oil exportable products, while speakers will lead discussions on topical issues around sustainable market access for Nigerian non-oil export as well as innovative solutions in booting non-oil export growth”. To this end, he said, the agency launched an awareness campaign with the theme, “Export for Survival” geared to sensitising the public on the need to embrace non-oil export as a major driver in the diversification efforts of the federal government.
