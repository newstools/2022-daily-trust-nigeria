A group, Crystal Muslim Organisation, has embarked on a programme to feed 5,000 residents of the FCT during the Ramadan and Easter period. Speaking at the distribution of food items, the group’s FCT ameer, Musa Daibu, said the gesture was to help reduce the hardship that the less privileged were facing in the country.

This is to touch their lives in the little way we can; which we know they all deserve better. The target is for us to feed as many people as we can.” While calling on other Nigerians to reach out to those in need of assistance, Ba’idu urged Nigerians to inculcate humanitarian gestures without boundaries.
