A non-governmental organisation, Velma ARC Foundation has organised a second rehabilitation boot camp for repentant cybercrime offenders, popularly known as ‘Yahoo Yahoo’. In a statement by the project coordinators, David Diya Ashaolu, Carla Ceravolo, and Matilda Adefalujo, the NGO said the second rehabilitation boot camp had been scheduled to hold from April 24 to May 22 at Igboya Community, Ile-Ife, Osun State. The NGO said the motivation to organise the boot camps was to reduce “the slew of societal vices stemming from massive unemployment, including the desire for quick riches, negative role models, and a society that does not support appropriate law enforcement.
