The Director General of the Gombe Geographic Information Systems (GOGIS), Dr Kabiru Usman Hassan, alongside the legal adviser of the agency, Barr Hussaini Ibrahim, has visited the Gombe Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial and Crimes Commission (EFCC) to seek partnership in combating corruption in land dealings and administration in the state. Speaking during the visit, Dr Hassan said the agency recognised the mandate of the commission and felt the need to seek its collaboration to strengthen the ongoing land administration reforms in Gombe State. He said, “Our visit today is paramount considering the role the commission is playing to ensure Nigeria is free from corruption at all levels. We at GOGIS recognise the importance of the commission’s mandate and therefore seek to partner with you, especially in areas of fighting corruption in land dealings and administration in the state.” In his response, the Gombe head of EFCC, Babashani Umar Sanda, “I am very impressed with the visit. It is timely because the highest cases the commission recorded last year were land-related matters.” He pledged to support the agency with staff capacity building trainings and other requisite supports to ensure that it delivered on its mandate. Commenting on the visit, the head of land fraud of EFCC, Gombe office, Mr Ofenimu Sunday, said the commission appreciated the agency’s prompt response on all its correspondences.
