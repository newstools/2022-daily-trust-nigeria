The immediate past speaker of the Gombe State House of Assembly, Abubakar Sadiq Ibrahim Kurba, Thursday resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a letter dated March 31 and addressed to the speaker of the Assembly, Kurba said he resigned from the APC for personal reasons with immediate effect. Kurba was elected the speaker when the sixth assembly was inaugurated in June 2019. However, on November 24, 2020, his colleagues impeached him over allegations of conniving with the executive arm of government against the interest of the legislators. However, he later fell out with Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, after the relationship between the governor and Senator Muhammad Danjuma Goje went sour. Kurba, believed to be a loyalist of Senator Goje, is said to be in Goje’s camp since his impeachment. Meanwhile, in a phone interview with Daily Trust, Kurba said he will announce his next political move soon. “When I pick the membership card of my new party, I will tell the good people of Gombe State why I resigned from the APC,” he said.
