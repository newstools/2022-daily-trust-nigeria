 The commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Osun State, Emmanuel Ocheja, yesterday, said community interface was working for the command in keeping peace in the state. He said the command was interfacing with communities across the state to aid its intelligence-driven operations to ensure safety of lives and property. He, therefore, emphasised on the need for security agencies to imbibe community-based approach to tackling insecurity rather than show of force. Mr Ocheja further said the Civil Defence Public Relations Committee (CDPRC) set up by the command was yielding good results and enhancing mutual cooperation between NSCDC operatives and the communities in the state. He assured the people of the state that any intelligence information given to the NSCDC would be proactively used to nip crime in the bud.
