 The Nigerian Maritime Safety and Administration Agency (NIMASA) has received a donation of $2.4 million (about N994.8m) from the Japanese government to support its Deep Blue Project. It also received another donation of a warship to add to its fleet from the Korean government. This was disclosed by the Director General of the agency, Dr Bashir Yusuf Jamoh in an interview with newsmen in Zaria, yesterday. He explained that the Deep Blue Project, otherwise known as the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, was initiated by the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Defence while being implemented by NIMASA. “Our Deep Blue Project, the SPOMO Act enacted by the National Assembly, the convictions of criminals under the SPOMO Act, the commitment of the Nigerian Navy and other military arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces, not forgetting the support from the international community, all led to the reduction of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr Jamoh has said the agency’s floating dock would soon be deployed. Jamoh made this disclosure while playing host to a delegation from the Nigeria Maritime University (NMU) to NIMASA in Lagos. The DG explained that experts from the manufacturers of the floating dock have been in Nigeria for over a month working on the nitty-gritty of deploying the dockyard. “When I gave them a deadline recently, I was given professional counsel not to rush the deployment. If we have waited this long, we might as well wait a while longer and ensure we don’t regret a deployment in a hurry,” the DG said. He also informed the NMU management that the facility will be available for students from the university for practical experience when it becomes functional.
