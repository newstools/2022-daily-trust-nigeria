A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, has called on Nigerians to elect leaders who are responsible and have the interest of the country at heart irrespective of their age. The former speaker made the call in Kaduna at the weekend while speaking as the special guest of honour at the 16th Annual Ramadan Lecture organised by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria (VON). “We will continue to pray and take part in the process and try as much as possible to have responsible people interested in the Nigerian project to lead irrespective of their age,” he said. Speaking on the topic ‘Social Media; Effects on Morality’, Bankole said social media is not the cause of Nigeria’s problems, but rather a consequence of its problems, adding that, “without a proper diagnostic experience, we cannot begin to proffer solutions to Nigeria’s problems.” He said, “If we get our responsibilities in the right order, from home, this thing can be treated from primary schools, secondary schools, formative years of young people, parents getting involved, empowering the local governments to make sure this thing works, then we will begin to get a proper foundation that would be very difficult for anyone to dissuade into bad immoral behaviour.”
