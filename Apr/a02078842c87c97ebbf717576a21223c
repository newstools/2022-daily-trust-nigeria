The Diaspora Coordinator for the Peoples Democratic Party National Women Parliament, Mrs. Olanike Babawande, says the party is optimistic of emerging victorious in the forthcoming July 16 governorship election in Osun State. She urged the people of the state to get their Permanent Voter Card (PVC) ready saying it remains the only weapon they need to make the change. She said, “PDP will reclaim Osun State from the All Progressives Congress in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. With Senator Ademola Adeleke, it’s right step in right direction. We urged people of the state to vote for him.” Babawande said if Adeleke received the necessary support of the people, the state would achieve the desired peace, progress and robust economic development. She said, “Osun State people should not allow the enemies of the people who camouflaged themselves as elders in society to trick them again. “Osun State people are wiser now and can no longer be deceived with lies and deceit again. We now know that we need the Peoples Democratic Party and Sen. Ademola Adeleke for the state to move forward positively in economic prosperity, statewide security and as well as in infrastructural development.”
