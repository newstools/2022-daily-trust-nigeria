The federal government has launched a document to guide the implementation of power distribution projects under the first phase of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI). Speaking at the launch of the six-volume document in Abuja on Tuesday, the minister of power, Engr Abubakar D. Aliyu, also announced the conclusion of the pre-engineering activities for the PPI distribution work package. He said, “It is with great pleasure that I declare the launch of the approved six volumes. We now have the playbook for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) that will form the bedrock of their implementation arrangements.” The PPI which pre-engineering contract with Siemens of Germany was approved in 2021 is a means to fast track the delivery of the initiative. The pre-engineering process involves officials of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) and the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) and Siemens. It is coordinated by FGN Power, a firm solely established by the government to drive the 25,000 megawatts (MW) target in phases. The managing director/CEO of FGN Power, Kenny Anuwe, highlighted the progress made with the PPI, especially in its Phase I, which is to rehabilitate and modernise the electricity value chain. He said, “This will create a rapid transformation in the on-grid electricity value chain, spur economic growth, create jobs and opportunities for Nigerian youth and enterprises, drive local content development through training opportunities and capacity building in the sector.” Mr Anuwe also said the close-out of the Pre-Engineering of Distribution Systems signified a milestone for the PPI, FGN Power and Nigerians to transform the power sector while assuring that the PPI will ensure achieving commercial autonomy by facilitating crucial investments for power delivery to Nigerians.
