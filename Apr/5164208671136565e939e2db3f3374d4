Worried by the increase in criminal activities around the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), on Tuesday, demolished over 500 illegal houses in Zamani, one of the communities around the airport. The director, development control of FCTA, Murkhtar Galadima, who spoke to journalists at the venue, said the operation would continue today. He said, “We are demolishing illegal structures all over Abuja. Over 500 illegal houses have been demolished today alone.” “Even those houses we marked, some people tried to cover up our markings and we removed those structures. We haven’t finished the exercise; until tomorrow.” The senior special assistant on monitoring, inspection and enforcement to the minister of the FCT, Mr Ikahro Attah, explained that the indigenous houses were spared because they had been living in Abuja before the creation of the capital city.
