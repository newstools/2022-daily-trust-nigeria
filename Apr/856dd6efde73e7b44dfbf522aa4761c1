Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) Plc has taken delivery of a fleet of Ground Support Equipment (GSE) with more ultra-modern equipment. The new fleet of equipment acquired included 10 passenger step units that were manufactured by Mallaghan, a renowned aviation industry manufacturer and supplier of highly acclaimed ground support equipment. The passenger step units have the capacity to provide passenger access to a wide range of aircrafts which includes B747, B777, B767, A340, A380, A320 etc, the firm said. Also, the equipment is fitted with proximity sensors which are devices that shut down the equipment engines when they are positioned too close to the aircraft to prevent aircraft damage. Another equipment acquired in the new fleet is an Air Starter Unit (ASU) which is used to supply the needed quantity of air at a specified pressure to aircraft while it is parked. The ASU was acquired from Guinault in France and has an eco-friendly engine while the chassis is made from steel to reduce the rate of corrosion or wear. It also has a safety device attached to the fuel gauge to enable it to shut down when fuel is less than 30 litres to prevent engine damage due to fuel shortage. Furthermore, two units of Airmarrel High Loader LAM 7000 are also part of the latest acquired fleet of GSE. The LAM 7000 has the capacity of loading about 7,000kg of pallets or containers at a time. In a related development, SAHCO Engineering team has produced 20 baggage carts from locally sourced materials. The equipment, which have been dispatched to SAHCO’s Abuja station, were produced according to European standards with huge improvements on their European counterparts. The Managing Director/CEO of SAHCO, Basil Agboarumi, said the company’s management decided to constantly invest in modern ground handling equipment to boost service delivery to clients.
