Senate President Ahmad Lawan has warned Multichoice Nigeria not to dare Nigeria by going ahead to hike the tariffs of its products while the matter is under investigation. The Senate had, on March 30, 2022, set up a seven-member ad hoc committee to investigate the tariff hike introduced by DSTV and other pay-tv service providers operating in the country. The panel is chaired by the Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi. Speaking while iinaugurating the committee yesterday, Lawan cautioned foreign operators in the country against taking Nigeria for granted. “No operator should take us for granted. We mean business. We want you to be here. Nigeria always provides the climate for you to do your businesses but don’t abuse the laws of our country. “Meanwhile, stay action. No increase. No increase. And that is to say don’t dare our country. No increase in tariffs,” Lawan warned. He explained that the constitution of the committee was to protect the legitimate interests of Nigerians. “It has been the practice of many companies, especially foreign companies operating in Nigeria to treat the Nigerian consumers of their products in a different way and manner that is not consistent with global best practices. “I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of this investigation but one thing is clear, that the Senate is prepared to go all the way to unearth the exact situation that is happening with respect to how much Nigerian consumers of the DStv or Pay-TV tariffs are charged and how does that compare to other jurisdictions in other countries,” he said.
