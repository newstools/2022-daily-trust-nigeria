A civil servant in Kano, Pharmacist Ghali Sule, has said he resigned from his work voluntarily to join the state gubernatorial race to improve the welfare of the people and boost economic development in the state. Contesting under the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), he said he commands the support of 99 per cent of pensioners and civil servants in the state. In an interaction with journalists at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat in Kano, the aspirant said he voluntarily resigned from the civil service after 31 meritorious years; with the remaining of four years to retire to allow him join politics. “There are certain abnormalities in governance, but you have to keep quiet as civil servants. Government officials don’t have right to criticize any wrong decision or policy of their employer. “I really need to bring change, and I have realised that the best option for me is to resign and join politics; you can correct wrongdoing if you have political power,” he said.
