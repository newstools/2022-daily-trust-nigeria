The owner of an abandoned scooter, with the brand name, Vespa, that recently caused panic in Pakata area of Ilorin West Local Government Area, Kwara State, has surfaced; bringing relief to the community. Our correspondent gathered that the white unmarked Vespa which was parked in front of a compound was there for over three weeks before it was removed last week. Speaking with Daily Trust, a community leader, Alhaji Ibrahim Agbobamu, in front of whose compound the scooter was parked, said the owner told them that he ran out of fuel the night he left it there. Alhaji Agbobamu explained that, “The owner came with a gallon of fuel and wanted to remove the scooter but was accosted by residents who almost descended on him for throwing the community into panic for weeks. “But for my intervention, it would have been a different story by now.” Another resident, Muhammad Isa, said, “The owner of the Vespa is a manager of one of the petrol stations in Pakata who ran out of fuel. Isa futher said, “However, he couldn’t return as he was arrested by the filling station’s owner that night over a fraud by some fuel attendants. “He told us that he spent about two weeks in police cell while rallying to get money to settle the case. He pleaded with us not to add to his predicament.” Effort to get the reaction of the police spokesman in the state, Ajayi Okasanmi, was not successful.
