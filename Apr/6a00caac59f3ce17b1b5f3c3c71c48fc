An expert in real estate development and business management, Rev. Ugochukwu Chime, has advised business owners on the need to build trust to achieve their individual and organisational goals. He said this at the Enugu Business Summit (AMADEO WEEK 2022) tagged, “Dare To Be Different,” in Enugu. The event, which had over 2000 persons consisting of leaders of industry, students, artisans and traders, also featured exhibitions, trade-fair and others. Chime, who is the Group Managing Director of COPEN Group, stated that the tendency and danger for most people today is to focus on the challenges of the Nigerian society and economy. “Unfortunately, focusing on these breeds hopelessness and despair. However, regardless of the times and nature of business, if we build trust with those we serve, we can thrive and succeed regardless of the state of the economy,” he said. He also added that trust is an indispensable asset for any business that is worth all the commitment and effort we make to gain and maintain it. Chime said the realisation of the value of trust had led to the era of packaging to ‘impress’, adding that while packaging might open the door to business opportunities, it is trust that will keep the door permanently open. According to him, gaining trust, which makes customers “repose confidence in us and our brands, requires a mixture of elements like honesty, patience, gracefulness etc.” Chime stressed that as a “customer’s decision to patronise you is totally dependent on the trust factor, it is essential we attach utmost importance to winning and retaining their trust.” He further said, “trust separates you from the rest; trust builds customer loyalty; trust helps you overcome difficult times, and it enhances lead conversion.”
