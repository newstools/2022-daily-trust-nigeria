The 15-year-old girl who was raped during a robbery early last month in Kubwa, a satellite town of Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has contracted gonorrhea. City & Crime had reported how armed robbers attacked a house and during their operation sexually assaulted the only girl in the family in the bedroom where all the other family members were tied up. A health worker at the Kubwa General Hospital, who pleaded for anonymity, confirmed this development to our reporter. She said the victim had been suffering from an unusual vaginal discharge, pain in her lower abdomen and pain when urinating since the incident. She further said, “The victim hasn’t been responding to treatment and her family has spent a lot of money. I learnt that she would soon be referred to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada.” A medical doctor, Kuti Demilade Kehinde, told our reporter that, in women, gonorrhea could spread into the uterus or fallopian tubes and cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).
