By Daniel Dada Keystone Bank Limited has partnered with Momas Electricity Meter Manufacturing Company Ltd (MEMMCOL) to train and provide financial independence for young women. Chairperson of KWEEC, Mrs Helen Maiyegun, said the committee was set up in line with the directive of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for commercial banks to support the empowerment of women in Nigeria. According to her: “We have been training women on skills acquisition such as catering, bead making, fashion design among others, but this time we decided to think outside the box and this brought about the partnership with MEMMCOL. “When you empower a woman, you are empowering the nation and that is why the Keystone Bank Women Economic Empowerment Committee monitoring and evaluation team will continue to monitor the progress of these women to ensure that they put into practice what they have learned.” Chairman of MEMMCOL, Mr Kola Balogun, appealed to other corporate organisations, as well as state and local governments, to key into the initiative to positively engage women. Chairman of the academic board, Momas Metering School, Engr Ademola Olorunfemi, also lauded the bank for providing a unique opportunity for young women, stressing that the initiative would not only add value to their lives but to their families, community and Nigeria at large.
