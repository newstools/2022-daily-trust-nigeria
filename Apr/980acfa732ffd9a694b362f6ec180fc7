A former Assistant Comptroller General of Customs (ACG), Bashir Abubakar, has declared his intention to contest the Kaduna State governorship position come 2023 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He described himself as the best person to replace the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, because of his paramilitary background and sound discipline in public service. Speaking at the party’s secretariat in Kaduna on Wednesday, he said he joined the race following calls by the people of the state. “After I retired in 2020, some associations requested that I joined politics because they see me as the most qualified person among all the contestants for the governorship position because they believe with my paramilitary background, I will be able to address the security challenges in the state,” he said. He also urged other contestants in the party to step down for him and join him to achieve his aspiration as he promised to carry them along to develop the state if elected the state governor.
