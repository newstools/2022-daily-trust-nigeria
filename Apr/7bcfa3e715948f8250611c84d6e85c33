A governorship aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Umar Sanda Abdullahi, has said that Niger State requires a leader with a genuine commitment to ending the ongoing onslaught on communities by bandits and insurgents. He stated this while declaring his intention to contest for the governorship position in the state in Minna, the Niger State Capital.

He said, “Peace and Security are key to Development and there is no way you can fight the current banditry without engaging the locals to work with the conventional security agencies. With the current security challenges facing Niger State, you would agree with me that at this point in time, the state deserves a highly committed leader that is willing and able to mitigate the current difficulties and move the state forward developmentally.” Abdullahi pointed out that the government would not have allowed the insecurity to deteriorate to the level it is before taking decisive action. According to him, any leadership that would take over in the state requires genuine interest to do everything possible to tackle insecurity and allow displaced farmers to return to their farming activities. The aspirant added that government also needs to focus more on agricultural and rural transformation to bridge the poverty rate in the state.
