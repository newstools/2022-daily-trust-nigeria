The Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said he will not make any declaration to contest for the presidency in 2023 until the conclusion of both the Lent and Ramadan fasts. Fayemi, who is the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), stated this Wednesday in Gombe, when he paid a courtesy call on Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya. According to him, he has already taken a position on whether to run for the office of the president in 2023 or not. He, however, stated that it was not the right time to make his position known to Nigerians. He explained that the country is in spiritual season and in respect of Nigerians, who are observing the Ramadan and Lent fasting, the time is not right for him to make a political declaration. “I have taken a position on that, but this is a very spiritual season to Nigerians, for us in the Christian faith, this is the period of Lent and for the people of Islam faith this is also Ramadan, and it is very rarely you see the two come together. Now they have come together in our country, it is a period that requires sober reflections. “I don’t think this is a period for political declarations, at a time that people are really into themselves and are introspecting about how we can build a better country,”he said.
