The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State to ensure all projects initiated by his administration are completed before 2023. The chairman of the party, Isa Sadiq Achida, made the call during the distribution of working tools donated by the member representing Wamakko/Kware Federal Constituency on Tuesday. “Let me passionately appeal to Governor Tambuwal to hasten the completion of the few projects embarked upon by his government so that our incoming government will not inherit a backlog of projects. “We know right from the beginning that they are white elephant projects which will never be completed,” he said. In his remarks, the leader of the party and a former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, advised leaders of the party at the local government level to fear God and ensure the masses benefit from any intervention from members of the party in positions of authority. “Don’t make it an affair for members of your immediate family alone; ensure your neighbours and those in dare need also benefit,” he said
