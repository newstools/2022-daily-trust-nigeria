A pro-All Progressives Congress (APC) group, Emefiele Solidarity Vanguard (ESV), has warned against the campaign of calumny against the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Godwin Emefiele, ahead of the 2023 general elections. Emefiele, who is yet to officially declare for the presidency, is being promoted and projected by various groups in the country. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, the leader of the group, Daniel Enyi, said Emefiele would boost all sectors and consolidate on the gains of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration if given the mandate. “We firmly believe that the economy needs a seasoned technocrat, an economist of high standard who understands monetary policy, diversification of the economy as well as a patriotic Nigerian who shall improve on the security situation and consolidate the gains of the Buhari administration. This we have found in Dr. Godwin Emefiele. “Nigeria needs a president who thinks beyond 2023, a man or woman who understands the economic situation of the country and is poised to improve on it. “This is a man who was appointed by the PDP administration of Dr. Goodluck Jonathan and was reappointed by President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term based on his dedicated service to the nation,” the group said.
