The Forum Of PDP Female Aspirants (FOFA) has called on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to exempt women who are aspiring for various elective positions from paying any fees. FOFA’s Secretary, Irene Awunah-Ikyegh, made the plea yesterday during a press conference held in Makurdi, the Benue State capital. “Exempt women standing for electoral office from paying any fees,” she said. The group further demanded equal opportunities in accessing microfinance by women cooperatives and selective provision affirmative action for women participation in democracy and other social areas. They also urged the PDP to ensure equitable representation of women in all aspects of national life, including party organs, by using affirmative action to ensure that at least 30 per cent of the workforce is women.
