The Accord Party has condemned the train attack in Kaduna and challenged security agencies to sit up in protecting the lives and property of Nigerians. The party, in a statement, described the attack as barbaric and condemnable, saying it sees the attack by the bandits, which left nine persons dead, many others wounded and others kidnapped, as one too many. The statement, signed by the National Legal Adviser of Accord, Maxwell Mgbudem, condoled with victims and families of the bereaved and wished those injured speedy recovery. The party, which also bemoaned the rising spate of killings across the country, said the time has come for the security architecture of Nigeria to be restructured, to adapt it to the modern-day realities of efficient and effective protection of citizens. To this end, the party urged Nigerians to vote massively for the Accord candidate in the 2023 presidential election if the country is to witness a genuine transformation in all aspects of its socio-economic and political life.
