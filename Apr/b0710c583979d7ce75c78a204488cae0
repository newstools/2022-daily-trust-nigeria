The Tin-Can Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service processed export goods with a N56.2 billion Free on Board (FoB) value in the first quarter of 2022. The goods weighed 71 metric tons, an increase of 62.7 per cent from the 44.5 tons of export goods with N31.4bn FOB it processed in the first quarter of 2021. The Customs Area Controller in charge of Tin Can Island Port, Comptroller Steven Oloyede, attributed the feat to the commitment of the management and entire officers and men of the command. He named some of the products exported to include copper ingots, sesame seeds, cashew nuts, cocoa beans, rubber, cocoa butter, leather, ginger and frozen shrimps, among others. “The Federal Ministry of Finance has recently published the 2022 Fiscal Policy with an effective date of April 1, 2022. However, a grace period of 90 days has been given for the implementation of the new duty and excise rates, which are to take effect from June 1, 2022,” he said. Oloyede listed some of the challenges the command faced in the period to include poor handling of overtime cargo which, he said, was due to non-implementation of existing laws that guide the treatment of such cargo. He also listed the gross shortage of government warehouses that would have provided a temporary storage for the overtime goods. Comptroller Oloyede said: “Despite our successes, the command is still facing challenges in the area of treatment of overtime cargo because of the non-implementation of extant laws guiding overtime cargo.”
