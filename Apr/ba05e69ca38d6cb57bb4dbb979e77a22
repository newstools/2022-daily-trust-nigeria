A former governor of Ekiti State and candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, has chided the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Mr Bisi Kolawole, for referring to him as a nomadic politician. Kolawole, while featuring on a media programme in Ado Ekiti, berated Oni for defecting from PDP to SDP, describing the SDP candidate as a nomadic politician. According to a press statement issued by the spokesman of the Ekiti Build Back Better (EBBB), a group campaigning for the actualization of the governorship ambition of the SDP candidate, signed by its spokesman, Idowu Adelusi, yesterday,  the group lambasted Kolawole, telling him that his comment was uncharitable. Adelusi said the decision and eventual movement of Oni to SDP was not about himself, but the collective decision of the Ekiti people, explaining that “previous attempts at a third force in Ekiti failed because the situation then did not call for it.”
