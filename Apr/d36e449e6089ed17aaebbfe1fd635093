The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employee (NULGE) has urged d Nigerians to vote out any state governor opposing local government autonomy, saying it is one of the impediments to development in Nigeria. The union also blasted governors in 36 states of the country over alleged poor conduct of local government elections. Speaking at a conference held at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, the NULGE National President, Comrade Olatunji Ambali said there was need to restore the country’s glory. “We need to restore Nigeria back to how it used to be. People no longer know the difference between the governor and the local governments’ chairman. That’s not the narration. Local governments should be returned to a service centre that would be able to provide social services. “All security challenges are local. So, local governments should be allowed to provide security and safety in the rural communities,” the union leader said.
