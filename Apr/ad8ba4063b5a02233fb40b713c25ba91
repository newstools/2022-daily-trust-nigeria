The new Chery auto brand of Kaduna-based PAN Nigeria Limited has been selected for the Nigeria Transport Awards at the ninth edition on 19th May, 2022 in Abuja. The Nigeria Transport Awards is a segment of the Nigeria Transport Lecture, which also features Lectures and Exhibitions. According to Transport Day newspaper, organizer of the event, the Chery auto brand was selected for recognition for making a grand re-entry into the Nigerian market. Transport Day Editor, Frank Kintum, stated that the awards’ board was convinced that the new brand was coming out with models that would meet the expectation of auto patrons in various economic strata of the country. The Chery is just one of the few selected transport brands up for recognition on that day. PAN had signed deals with two leading Chinese companies, Chery Automobile and Higer Bus Company, which specialize in the production of passenger cars and commercial vehicles. While Chery is a leading manufacturer of Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV) and Sedans, Higer is a reputable producer of mini and city buses. The assembly of multiple brands at the PAN plant has increased capacity utilization, created new jobs, and promoted local content development.
