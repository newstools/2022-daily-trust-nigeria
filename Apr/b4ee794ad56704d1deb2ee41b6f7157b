A former deputy president of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu and the youth wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo have condemned the violence that disrupted the expanded stakeholders’ meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Aninri LGA of Enugu State at the weekend. In a statement by his media adviser, Mr Uche Anichukwu, yesterday, Ekweremadu, a governorship aspirant in the state described as unacceptable the alleged violent attack on his political supporters and associates during the said meeting at Ndeaboh and asked security agencies to arrest and prosecute perpetrators of the crime. Ekweremadu recalled that the attack left many, including the member representing Aninri State Constituency in the Enugu State House of Assembly, Chinedu Okwu, critically injured and hospitalised, calling on the security agencies to ensure that the culprits faced the wrath of the law. “I received with utmost sadness the news of the violence that marred the expanded stakeholders meeting of the PDP in Aninri LGA at the weekend, as well as the brutal attack on my supporters and associates at the said meeting. “I also condemn any attempt to pollute the processes leading up to the 2023 elections in Enugu State with acts of political intolerance, intimidation, violence and destruction of lives and property. That is not what Ndi Enugu, the Waawa people are known for. “I, therefore, call on the security agencies and the relevant authorities to swing into action to ensure that the perpetrators and masterminds of this brigandage are fished out and brought to book to serve as a deterrent to future troublemakers,” Ekweremadu said.
