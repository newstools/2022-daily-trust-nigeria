Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has promised ”to unite the divided country” if given the opportunity to lead the country. Addressing APC chairmen from the six states in the North Central geo-political zone and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), during an Iftar dinner in Abuja, Olawepo-Hashim explained that “anyone who grew up in the North Central zone where about 86 ethnic groups lived would have learnt one or two lessons in diversity. He told the chairmen that “Charity begins at home. The North Central is where I have made home. And that is why my consultation is starting from here, adding that the lessons in diversity will assist him in tackling the problems in Nigeria. He also noted that the country is presently “really divided along ethnic and religious lines” and re-emphasised his intention to run an inclusive government since “it is very difficult for any party to even produce a candidate right now that can win in more than four zones out of the six zones of the country because of the division in the country.” The aspirant also said he would declare for the race on Tuesday, May 3, 2022, explaining that there was the need to allow “our Muslim brothers and sisters to conclude the observation of the holy month of Ramadan, which will end on April 30th. The meeting had in attendance Haliru Jokantoro, Niger; John Mamman of Nasarawa; Prince Sunday Fagbemi, Kwara; Hon. R. D. Bature, Plateau; Comrade Austin Ajade, Benue and Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, FCT. Other critical stakeholders include Senator Makanjuola Ajadi from Kwara and Hon. Miko, the 1999 House of Representatives member representing Ogoni, Rivers State. In his remark, Senator Ajadi harped on the sterling qualities of Mr. Olawepo-Hashim who, he said, is a credible aspirant for the party’s position for the office of president.
