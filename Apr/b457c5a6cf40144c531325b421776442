The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has said it is training some youths and women in Enugu and Bayelsa States on business skills. In Enugu, NDE commenced the training of 100 unemployed beneficiaries under the Small-scale Enterprises (SSE), Department’s Start Your Own Business (SYOB) scheme. The Director General, Mallam Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo represented by the Enugu State Coordinator, Donatus Uchegbu told the trainees that they should avail themselves and make use of the window provided to access the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) funds available for business start-ups. In Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, NDE said it disbursed N8.06 million to 235 beneficiaries that have been trained in business skills. Fikpo who was represented by the Bayelsa Coordinator of NDE, Mr Aham Osuchukwu, said the SYOB has seven beneficiaries who are all graduates of tertiary institutions, who wrote business feasibility studies and the agency deemed viable to assist them to grow. Osuchukwu said: “Each of them got a loan of N500,000 only to enable them set up their businesses. The remaining 228 beneficiaries who got N20,000 were selected under the Micro-Enterprise Enhancement Scheme to boost their existing micro-businesses.” He said the loan has an interest rate of nine per cent and a moratorium period of six months. A grant beneficiary, Miss Ayibalayefa Jones said they will make effective use of the facility as they are aware that it is a revolving loan.
