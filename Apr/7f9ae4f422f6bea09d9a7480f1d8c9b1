Kinsmen and supporters on Monday morning stormed streets in Abeokuta, Ogun State, in solidarity with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, hours after he declared to run for the presidency. Osinbajo, in a seven minutes video, in the early hours of Monday, joined the race after many months of denial and pressure on him by his supporters to make his intention known. The supporters, under the aegis ‘The New Tribe, Ogun State’, stormed the streets in a solitary demonstration tagged ‘A walk for Osinbajo’. The group, led by a three-time gubernatorial candidate in the state, Gboyega Nasiru Isiaka (GNI), marched through the streets of Abeokuta, expressing their satisfaction that Osinbajo has finally accepted their call. Speaking with newsmen, Isiaka who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), extolled the virtues of the vice president, describing him as most suitable for the job. He said “I don’t see his declaration as a betrayal to Tinubu. I think it is a clarion call that he has heeded to. If there are issues that need to be sorted out, I think there are better ways of sorting that out aside from the fate and the future of 200 million Nigerians.” It was a similar scenario in Kano as supporters of the vice president trooped out in celebration of his declaration. Our correspondent reports that the popular Maiduguri road in Kano came to a standstill as Osinbajo’s supporters trooped out. The chairman, Coalitions for Osinbajo, Sagir Wada Mai Iyali, said the V-P’s declaration has stamped a testimonial for the prosperity of Nigeria and Nigerians.
