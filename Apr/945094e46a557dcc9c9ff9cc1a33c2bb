 To provide lasting solutions to real-life marketing challenges, Eko Innovation Centre, in collaboration with GDM Group, has unveiled the maiden edition of its Media and Marketing Hackathon tagged MarkHack 1.0 which is also regarded as the first of its kind in Nigeria. Speaking at the official launch of the hackathon, founder of Eko Innovation Centre & Curator, Art of Technology Lagos, Mr Victor Afolabi said, “The Nigerian marketing industry has started to see preliminary innovation, but acceleration is slow to disrupt the future in line with changing consumer behaviour. “We are yet to experience notoriety for a homegrown technological breakthrough at a remarkable scale in the marketing industry.” He stated further that the MarkHack was conceptualised to make a difference. Organisers of the event revealed that over 500 individuals registered to participate in the hackathon from 72 locations, five countries (Nigeria, US (California), Kenya, Pakistan and UK (London), and three continents (Africa, Europe and North America). It also announced that the best 10 teams with the most viable concepts would go head-to-head at the finale on 18th May for a chance at the $20,000 prize pool and an acceleration programme with up to $50K equity investment to get their products ready for the market among other benefits. Delivering the keynote address, David M. Raab, Founder/CEO, Customer Data Platform Institute, urged marketers to be innovative, understand the concept of disruption and be deliberate about it.
