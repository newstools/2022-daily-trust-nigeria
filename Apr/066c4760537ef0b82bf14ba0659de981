These include the base transceiver stations (BTS), the underground fibre optic cable, as well as associated infrastructure. “One of the major challenges to quality of service that operator provide to you, is vandalism of telecom infrastructure, such as Base Transceiver Stations (BTS). “Others are theft, hostility from some host communities, which have continued to pose a major setback to the industry.
