The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kwara State has vowed to replicate the ‘Otoge’ movement of 2019 against the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections in the state. The Otoge slogan, which was adopted by the APC during the 2019 elections played a huge role in the party’s overwhelming victory and the defeat of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. But following the victory, the APC later found itself in a leadership crisis that led to the decamping of some members of the faction hitherto led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to the SDP. But speaking in Ilorin on Tuesday after his inauguration and other executive members, the new party Chairman, AbdulAzeez Afolabi told reporters that the party will repeat the Otoge mantra in 2023 against the ruling party. Responding to the issue, the Chairman of the APC, Prince Sunday Fagbemi, described the “boast” as a white elephant project and wishful thinking.
