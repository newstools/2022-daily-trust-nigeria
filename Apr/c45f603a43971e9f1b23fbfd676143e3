The Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) has urged Nigerians to put pressure on the National Assembly to pass the Electoral Offences Commission Bill to curb electoral offences in the country. The Chairman of INEC, Mahmood Yakubu, who made the remark yesterday in Abuja, said the establishment of the commission would ease the prosecution of electoral offenders. Speaking at a roundtable organised by the Electoral Hub, Yakubu stated that the country is not short of electoral laws but prosecution is the bane of the commission. On his part, a former Chairman of INEC, Attahiru Jega, said political parties, candidates, election officials and security operatives are culprits in electoral offences, thus, canvassed for the establishment of the commission.
