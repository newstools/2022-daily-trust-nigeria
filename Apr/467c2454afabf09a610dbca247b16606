Nnaji stated that none of the victims had been identified so far as they were burnt beyond recognition. He said, “We are awaiting the arrival of the commissioners of Petroleum and environment to perform mass burial because the bodies are decomposing. “It is a large market involving people from all parts of the country; and since they burnt beyond recognition, it is very difficult to identify them. A family just came and saw one body, which they said resembled one of their own and they carried it for burial according to traditional rites.”
