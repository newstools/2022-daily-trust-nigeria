The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has visited the emirs of Kano and Bichi as part of consultation towards the actualisation of his presidential ambition. The consultation visit is coming days after the minister declared his intention to vie for the presidency. He visited the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and later that of Bichi, Alhaji Nasiru Ado Bayero, at their palaces. While welcoming him to the palace, the Emir Aminu thanked the minister for choosing Kano State for his first consultation visit. “I know him since when he was speaker, to the time he became governor and now a minister. All these made him to qualify to contest for the seat of president of Nigeria,” the emir said. On his part, the Emir of Bichi, Alhaji Nasiru said they have a long-standing relationship with Amaechi and wished him well. He urged all contestants and the present leaders to always put the country first before themselves, saying only this will bring peace, harmony and progress to the country. On his part, the minister thanked the two emirs for their warm reception, kind words and blessings towards his aspiration.
