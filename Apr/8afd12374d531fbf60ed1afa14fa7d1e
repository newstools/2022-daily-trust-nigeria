The Managing Director (MD) of Doxas Digital Nigeria, Mrs Adedayo Benjamin Laniyi, who is contesting the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) senatorial ticket on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said she is in the race to win the poll and represent the interest of diverse ethnic groups in the territory. Speaking with newsmen after obtaining her expression of interest and nomination forms on Thursday in Abuja, Mrs Laniyi noted that the unity of all Nigerians living in the FCT was non-negotiable and pledged to give the FCT the best representation at the upper chamber of the National Assembly. Mrs Laniyi said she was in the race to succeed Senator Philip Aduda of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to fulfil the strong desire of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, that women should take central positions in the politics of the country.
