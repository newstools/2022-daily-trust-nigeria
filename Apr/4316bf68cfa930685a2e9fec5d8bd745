The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has declared his intention to run for the presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ngige, while addressing his supporters in his home town, Alor in Idemili North of Anambra, also said President Muhammad Buhari has not failed. According to him, the president worked with the resources available to him. “Some people will say this administration has failed, a government that built Enugu-Onitsha express road, Enugu–Port Harcourt express, restored Nigeria’s aviation industry, built railways and built many other landmark projects across the country cannot be called a failure. “Buhari performed according to the resources available to him,” he said. Ngige said if given the opportunity to lead, he would be president of Nigeria and everybody will be proud of him. He said he has what it takes to embark on the journey to the contest and become Nigeria’s next president. He said his present position has broadened his horizons and exposed him to the reality of Nigeria, noting that he knew what to do as president.
