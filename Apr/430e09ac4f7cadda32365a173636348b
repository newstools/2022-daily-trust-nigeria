Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, has accused the United States  of plotting to profit from the Russian-Ukraine conflict, thereby indebting future generations of Ukrainians. President Joe Biden had on Thursday asked Congress for $33 billion to support Ukraine, and the Ukrainian president pleaded with lawmakers to give the request a swift approval. TRT World reports that the Biden’s funding request includes over $20 billion for weapons, ammunition and other military assistance, as it also called for $8.5 billion in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government and $3 billion in humanitarian aid. But the Russia’s parliament chief Friday said Ukraine is effectively mortgaging itself to the United States by seeking to tap billions of dollars of weapons loans proposed by US President Joe Biden. Volodin said, “Lend-Lease is a commodity loan, and not cheap: many future generations of Ukrainian citizens will pay for all the ammunition, equipment and food that the United States will supply. “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is driving the country into a debt pit.”
