 Ahead of the July 16 governorship election in Osun State, the Yiaga Africa, a civic group, has raised the alarm that politicians are inducing the voters with 5,000 and food items. It also said the election may be threatened by activities of political thugs and cult groups. The organisation stated this in its “Watching the vote pre-election observation report” for Osun State. Yiaga said it deployed Long Term Observers (LTOs) to all 30 local government areas in Osun to assess preparatory activities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) towards the election. “Some of the activities reported are violent physical attacks during political party meetings or campaigns and vandalism of properties belonging to party supporters,” the report said. Similarly, the organisation also tracked voter inducement in the form of distribution of money and gift items to voters and the purchase of PVCs in Atakumosa West LGA. “Long Term Observers witnessed and heard of the distribution of money and food items by candidates or their supporters while campaigning in Boluwaduro, Ejigbo, Ife North, Ifedayo, Ilesa East, Ilesa West Irepodun, Isokan, Odon-Otin and Orolu LGAs. “Also, politicians distributed food items like rice, beans, garri, and semolina; and money ranging between N2,000 and N5,000 per voter,” the report said.
