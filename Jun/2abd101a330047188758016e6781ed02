An Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, on Wednesday restrained the state House of Assembly from impeaching the deputy governor of the state, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan. Daily Trust recalled that 24 out of the 32 members of the State House of Assembly had last week petitioned the speaker of the house over alleged “gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office, insubordination and other offences by the deputy governor.” We are in mood of winning 2023 polls – APC PDP, NNPP to Ogun striking workers: Don’t compromise The deputy governor had dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). But in a ruling presided by Justice Oladiran Akintola, the court restrained the state House of Assembly from removing the state deputy governor, Raufu Olaniyan, from office. Our correspondent reports that Rauf Olaniyan, on Tuesday, approached the state high court to stop his proposed impeachment process by the state House of Assembly but the case was adjourned till Wednesday. Efforts to get the reaction of the chairman House Committee on Information, Kazeem Olayanju, proved abortive as his number was unreachable. A chieftain of the party, Mogaji Wale Oladoja, however, told Daily Trust that the party would continue to find legal means to remove the deputy governor. He said; “We are going to remove him with all legal means. I spoke with the leadership of the assembly and I can assure you that they are yet to receive such directive from court. This is an issue of morality. He should resign honourably. “We cannot continue to play bad politics. The party that brought you into power must be respected. Let him resign to avoid disgrace,” he said.
