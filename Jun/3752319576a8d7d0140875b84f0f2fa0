The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Sunday, said he has grown the monthly Oyo State Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) from N1.8 billion he inherited in 2019 to over N3.3 billion within three years. Makinde, who stated this while featuring on a live interview programme, “Meet the Governor”, hosted by the state-owned Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State, and joined live by radio stations across the state, said he was confident that the people of the state would pay him back with their votes in 2023. Makinde said his government had done well in the areas of education, economy, infrastructure, health and other key areas of the economy in the state. He noted that the government had gone far with building infrastructure that targeted the economy, as it was equally constructing roads from Oyo to Iseyin, from Ogbomoso to Iseyin, from Beere to Ona-Ara, from Ajia to Airport Road and Amuloko, while a limited rehabilitation was going on at the Igbo Ora-Igangan Road.
