Justice Mohammed Ibrahim of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court sitting in Kubwa has ordered the FCT Administration to swear in the newly elected chairmen and their councillors immediately. It would be recalled that on May 18, 2022, same Justice Mohammed Ibrahim suspended the swearing in of the elected chairmen and their councillors, which generated confusion. Following the earlier judgement, the FCT Minister, Muhammed Bello, suspended the inauguration and ordered the legal team of the FCTA to seek redress of the judgment. Justice Mohammed, while delivering the fresh judgment on Thursday, clarified that everyone was in a learning process and that people were bound to make mistakes and also bound to make corrections. He said it was very clear that some mistakes were made and a judgment was entered which brought a lot of issues concerning the elongation of the tenure of the outgoing chairmen in the six area councils. Justice Mohammed further said that in his wisdom, he had vacated the first judgment that was given by him and thereby directed that the FCT minister should immediately go ahead and swear in the new area council chairmen and their councillors who were recently elected and issue certificates of return.
