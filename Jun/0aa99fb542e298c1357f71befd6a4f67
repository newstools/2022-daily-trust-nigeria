The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has told President Muhammadu Buhari that the South East will not accept any presidential candidate from the northern region of the country ahead of the All Progressives Congress primary slated for June 6, 7 and 8. The group said it would be grateful to the president if he anointed any of the APC presidential aspirants of Igbo extraction. The apex social-cultural group also warned that APC would lose the 2023 presidential election if another northern aspirant emerges as flag bearer of the party. Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, made this known in a statement issued on Thursday and made available to our correspondent in Abakiliki.
