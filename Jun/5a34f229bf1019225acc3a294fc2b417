The Northern Women Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the party’s governorship candidates to pick women as running mates. The group’s coordinator, Hajiya Zainab Abubakar Ibrahim, made the call yesterday at a campaign launch on Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) registration and collection in Katsina. She said the campaign was also aimed at admonishing women to desist from engaging in vote trading and other malpractices. She said: “The task of choosing good leaders across all tiers of government lay on your shoulders. I am pleading, appealing and urging those who are yet to register or collect their PVCs, to in the patriotic interest of this nation, register and collect them before the deadline.” She urged the participants to campaign and vote for APC candidates across the country during the general elections. The event was hosted by Hajiya Hadiza Bello Masari, wife of Katsina State governor, and attended by APC women leaders from the northern states.
