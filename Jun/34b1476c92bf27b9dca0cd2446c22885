The Group Managing Director, Rainoil Limited, Mr Gabriel Ogbechie, has narrated how he started the company with N300,000 when he was 30 years old and recorded growth in the investment in the last 25 years. He stated this at the weekend during a celebration to mark the silver jubilee of the petroleum firm in Lagos, noting that there is no shortcut to success. “We built our first depot at Oghara (Delta State) and the second in Calabar (Cross River). Today we are the only downstream company that has three depots in the country,” he said, adding that the firm now employs over 2,000 staff.” Pastor of Daystar Church, Bolutife Oluyomi, speaking at the occasion, said people should strive for commitment. “No matter how much we justify our excuses, they’re still just that – excuses. Therefore, we must endeavour to give our best no matter what to ensure that no stone is left unturned in achieving our organisational goals,” he said. The Group Executive Director, Rainoil, Mrs Godrey Ogbechie, spoke on the outlook of the firm, saying, “Certainly, the next 25 years promise new opportunities for us here at Rainoil Group as a whole – and we are optimistic. That is why we have organised this service to celebrate our past wins, as well as to till the ground for fresh growth.” The company said it made donations to two schools in Lagos and three in Delta State.
