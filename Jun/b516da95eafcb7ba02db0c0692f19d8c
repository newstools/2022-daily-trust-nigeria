Berger Paints Nigeria (BPN) PLC, a manufacturer of coated paints and allied products, has emerged as the first company in Nigeria to commence a four-day work week, scheduled for July 1, 2022, to upscale productivity through flexible operation and extended rest period for its staff, the company has announced. The novel work initiative, which has been embraced by the company’s staff, will neither lead to staff rationalisation nor salary reduction, it explained. With this, Berger Paints joins Kaduna State, which on December 1, 2021, adopted a four-day work week.  The government argued that allowing workers an extra day of rest had the potential of boosting their productivity. In an emailed statement, the company’s chairman, Mr Abi Ayida, gave assurance that the new four-day work week would not affect the customers and other external stakeholders as a full week of services would still be provided in certain core functions related to customer fulfillment. “We have thought long and hard on how we can better take care of our people in an impactful and lasting way. I am therefore pleased to announce that from next month we will be the first Nigerian company, that I am aware of, to permanently change to a four-day work week,” the chairman said. He declared that the four-day week will not lead to staff rationalisation, as the intended outcome of this change is enhanced productivity from better-rested people, adding that rest and recovery are key metrics of sustained performance. “This initiative will go a long way in redressing this imbalance and is not only beneficial to the employee but will also benefit the company,” he said.
