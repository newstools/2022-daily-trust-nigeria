Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, the Senate Leader, has defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State. Abdullahi’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Muhammad Jamil Gulma, confirmed the defection on Tuesday. “Senate Leader Dr Yahaya Abdullahi will on Wednesday by 9 am leave Abuja for Kebbi and proceed to Kamba local government to formally declare for PDP and to possibly indicate his interest to contest his present seat,” Gulma said. Yahaya who participated in the APC’s Kebbi governorship primaries was reported to have scored Zero vote, an outcome which he had since rejected and described as shambolic and a child’s play.
