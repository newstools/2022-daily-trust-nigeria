The Ekiti State governor-elect, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, and his Deputy, Mrs Monisade Afuye, yesterday, received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Oyebanji polled 187, 057 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Engr Segun Oni, who polled 82,211 votes. The governor-elect, after receiving the certificate at INEC office in Ado Ekiti, described the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Authentication System (BVAS) as a game changer in the country’s electoral process. Oyebanji, while addressing the crowd of party supporters and admirers, pledged to execute his 6-point agenda zealously to usher a new dawn of progress and development of Ekiti. “Let me thank the INEC for providing a level-playing ground for the contenders in this election. I can’t agree with the INEC as the BVAS was a game changer in our election. “Nobody ever believed what happened on Saturday could ever happen. Some people didn’t believe that the rigging of the election was over but the Ekiti election really convinced us.” The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Ekiti, Dr Adeniran Tella, urged all the stakeholders to support the INEC in conducting credible elections. INEC National Commissioner (South West), Sam Olumekun, urged the winner that while celebrating, he must think of how to understand the problems of the citizens, and how best to resolve them.
