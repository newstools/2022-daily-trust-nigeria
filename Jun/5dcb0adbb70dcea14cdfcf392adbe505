City & Crime learnt that Abiodun and his “co-travellers” were left off the hook on Sunday night by the kidnappers after a N1.5m ransom. A source close to the family told City & Crime that the headmaster’s body “is all sores and wounds. He came home around 8pm. He was badly beaten. “They were given raw cassava to eat throughout any time they complained of hunger. So he and the other man have been hospitalised. “The lady among the kidnapped has also been taken to a hospital in Ilorin.” The Kogi State police spokesman, SP William Aya, confirmed their release, saying they had been reunited with their families. It would be recalled that the headmaster and the two others were abducted penultimate Friday on their way to a burial ceremony at Kabba.
