 The deputy national publicity secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Yakubu Murtala Ajaka, has said a former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, should return to the party because he has better chances of becoming president on the party’s platform in the future. Kwankwaso, a former minister, had left the APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and contested its 2019 presidential ticket but lost to a former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Recently, he dumped the PDP for the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) where he picked the party’s apex ticket to run for the 2023 poll. But speaking with newsmen on Sunday in Abuja, the deputy spokesman for the APC, said it is not too late for Kwankwaso to retrace his steps. He said Kwankwaso knows much about the formation of the APC and had contributed immensely to its success in the 2015 general poll, adding that APC leaders hope to repay him at the appropriate time. He however said the former lawmaker cannot be outside the party’s fold to be a beneficiary in the future. “Kwankwaso needs a national party like APC to achieve his presidential ambition. So, I plead with him to do the needful before it’s too late. The APC is where he naturally belongs and has an assurance of becoming a president one day, and not his current sectional NNPP. “Just like Kwankwaso, Peter Obi is only enjoying sectional sympathy but a real presidential candidate needs to enjoy acceptability from all parts of the country,” he said.
