The Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) has sought partnership with Nigerian shippers to maximally utilise the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). AGOA is a key component of US/African strategy that focuses on increasing African non-oil exports to the US.

Speaking at a meeting with Nigerian shippers in Abuja, Salaam said, “The AGOA project initiated by the United States of America in 2000 was to help develop trade and facilitate the export of over 6, 000 goods into America with no tariff. “The trade agreement, primarily set up to simulate the African economy, covered 15 years and had since elapsed in 2015. However, Nigeria and other countries on the programme have been given a second chance when the programme was extended by another 10 years.” Mr Salaam added that it was only exporters that could liberate Nigeria from the present economic slavery through a focus on the exportation of non-oil products. He further said, “I, therefore, call on all shippers to associate with NACC to take maximum advantage of the second chance by leveraging on the 6,500 items allowed to be exported to the USA.” The Director, Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Abuja Liaison Office, Mrs Karimatu Uthman, said partnering with NACC would boost the economy of the country through increased export of non-oil products. She said, “We will continue to work with NACC in the country by leveraging on exporting non-oil products outside the shores of the country. Over time, we will organise training on how to export products through shipping.”
