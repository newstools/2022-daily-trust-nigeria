Anambra State governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, says he will play key role to ensure that his party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), produces the next governor of Abia State. Soludo stated this yesterday at the Governor’s Lodge, Amawbia, in Awka South LGA of the state when the party’s governorship candidate in Abia State for the 2023 poll, Prof Gregory Ibe, visited him.

He said, “Prof. Greg’s personal contributions to the development of society are deserving of commendation. I am certain Abia desperately needs a Greg Ibe. We shall be in Abia to lead the charge when the time comes.” The governor asked some South easterners who are dissipating into other platforms to return to APGA to expand the frontiers of development. Earlier, Prof. Ibe said the visit was to formally congratulate Soludo on his assumption of office as governor of Anambra State and subsequently identify with his administration.
