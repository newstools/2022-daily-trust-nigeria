Senator Ibrahim Shekarau has emerged as the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP)’s candidate for the Kano Central Senatorial District at the 2023 general election. He won the party’s ticket unopposed at the primaries in Gezawa, headquarters of Gezawa Local Government Area (LGA) of Kano State. Shekarau, a former governor of Kano State and a serving senator, defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to NNPP after failing to secure the party’s ticket for another term in the senate. Dr Abdullahi Baffa also won the NNPP ticket for Kano North, while Mr Kawu Sumaila got the ticket for Kano South. (NAN)
