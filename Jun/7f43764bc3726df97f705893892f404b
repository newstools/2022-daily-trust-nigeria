An aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the just-concluded Nasarawa West senatorial primary, Barrister Labaran Magaji, has urged the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to set up a special committee to investigate the alleged 125 fake delegates from the zone. Magaji made the appeal in an interview with newsmen shortly after he was received in Nasarawa Toto LGA on Sunday by his teeming supporters at a grand reception organised for him.

He said the primary poll in the district was marred by irregularities, alleging that there was a doctored list of 125 delegates from Nasarawa and Keffi LGAs. He, however, promised not to dump the APC for another political party and appealed to his supporters to remain calm and resolute over the outcome of the primary poll held at the convocation square of the Nasarawa State University, Keffi. He said after a series of postponements, the election was held on June 4, and that “by the special grace of God, the election was held peacefully. I polled 114 votes while my opponent was alleged to have polled 179 votes. “Soon after the election, facts emerged that touched the credibility of the process, which we revealed, and we discovered that there was a very fundamental controversy surrounding the process.”
