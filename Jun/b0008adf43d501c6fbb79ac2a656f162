The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has decried the high rate of insecurity in Mpape, a settlement close to the Maitama District of Abuja, saying it will embark on a fresh demolition exercise in the community aimed at checking the trend. City & Crime recalls that about six months ago the FCTA task force on sanitation visited the community and removed illegal structures and street urchins. The administration, at a stakeholders meeting with security agencies, traditional rulers, market associations and scrap materials sellers on Monday, said it would relaunch the demolition exercise. The Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, who presided over the meeting, said the case of Mpape seemed very complex but that his team was committed to solving it. Attah noted that FCTA’s plan to transform the crush rock area of the community to a world class tourism site was on course with a committee already working on it. Tanko Yamawo, Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Community Relations, who was present in the meeting, called on all stakeholders to work in synergy in tackling the criminalities. Also speaking, the Secretary of Bwari Area Council, Kadanya Peter, who represented the chairman of the council, pledged support to the proposed demolition but pleaded that the areas not marked should be spared. In his remarks, Chief Musa Haruna, the traditional ruler of Mpape, while consenting that removal of rebuilt illegal structures, pleaded that roadside traders should be given a more convenient place.
