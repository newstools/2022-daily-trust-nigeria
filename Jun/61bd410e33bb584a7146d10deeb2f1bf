A member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Elder Tim Osadolor, has said the choice of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as running mate to a former Vice President presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, will help in delivering the South-South and South-East votes to the party in the 2023 polls. He also cautioned Nigerians not to waste their votes on the All Progressives Congress (APC), arguing that a vote for the party was a vote for the continuation of insecurity and punishment for Nigerians.

Osadolor said, “I am confident that PDP will win the presidential election, because if you see the upsurge in people getting registered, it is to say thank you to the APC, and this thank you doesn’t mean they are grateful; it means thank you for the ones you have done, but what you have done is grossly inadequate, so please, go home and make space for a more credible alternative.” The PDP chieftain further said his party had done something very noble and commendable in paring Gov Okowa, who is an acclaimed grassroots mobiliser, with a personality like Atiku, also a known national grassroots mobiliser. He added, “To the people of the South East, Ifeanyi is a son to us in the South-South; Okowa is a son, so that alone will bring the votes like never before from the South East and the South-South. It is a good combination that is capable of winning the election.”
