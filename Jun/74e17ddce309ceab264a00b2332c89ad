The Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), Muhtari Aminu-Kano, has called on Nigerians to cultivate the culture of afforestation and reforestation towards combating desertification and climate change impact. He spoke in Abuja at a one-day workshop on enhancing biodiversity mainstreaming in the actions of the Great Green Wall (GGW) organised by BirdLife International and the NCF. The gathering was with the theme: “Make the Sahel Greater and Greener for Nature and People”. According to Aminu-Kano, if nothing is done, climate change, especially desertification, will drive humanity into annihilation, unexpected devastation and pandemics. The Director General of the GGW National Agency in Chad, Ahamat Mahamat Haggar, said, “The Great Green Wall is a great development opportunity for communities to integrate socio-economic and ecological conditions in a context of climate change and insecurity.
