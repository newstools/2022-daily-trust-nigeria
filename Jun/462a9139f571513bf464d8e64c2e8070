The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has suggested that the House Committee on Constitutional Review should revisit the gender bills earlier rejected by the house during the “clause to clause” consideration of constitution amendment. He made the suggestion shortly after addressing members of the house at the resumed plenary yesterday after its short recess for members to participate in the primaries held by political parties to elect candidates for the 2023 general elections. Gbajabiamila said, “Lest I forget, I would encourage the Committee on Constitution Review to very quickly, among other bills, revisit the issue of gender neutrality or empowerment as the case may be, which we looked at a couple of months ago so that we take a look after rescinding our decision. We can take a look at those decisions and look for some kind of consensus in passing those gender-sensitive bills in the constitutional amendment. “Before I close, I want to repeat for emphasis, the process, the electoral process that we have just experienced. We thank God that all of Nigerians have now seen what we saw.”
