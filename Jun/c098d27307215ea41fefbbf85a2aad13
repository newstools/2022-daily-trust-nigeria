The board Chairman of CSDA, Chief Peter Sani Ochijele, noted that the exercise was meant to train stakeholders invited from the local government areas so that they could know more about the project. The CSDA Manager of Basic Services, Engr Thomas Agbo, intimated that the project was meant for the provision of services for vulnerable groups and communities in the rural areas of the state with a community-driven approach for livelihood support, food security and services within two years.
