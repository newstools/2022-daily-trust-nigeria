The Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, in Oyo, Mr Abiodun Oni, says not less than 197 waste collectors have re-applied for contract under the Private Sector Participation (PSP) arrangement. This is contained in a statement issued on Monday in Ibadan by the State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr Wasiu Olatunbosun. The News Agency of Nigeria  recalls that the state government recently terminated the appointment of the contractors due to the poor service delivery regarding waste collection. Government consequently appointed Mottanai Recycling as the state’s waste management consultant, as part of steps to create a turnaround in the environment sector. (NAN)
