Patients at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) have continued to lament worsening power failure and scarcity of water. The development which started on Saturday has affected services at the facility and hygiene of the patients. Relatives of patients who spoke with City & Crime on the issue said surgeries for some patients had either been postponed or rescheduled. Ono Mike, a relative of one of the patients said, “We were supposed to have a surgical operation for a patient at the main theatre, but we were told that there is no water and power to carry it out. When we asked why can’t there be generator to power, we didn’t get any reasonable response.” A patient at the emergency ward said the situation had worsened the condition of their illnesses because of lack of proper hygiene. He said, “There is no light to power the borehole for us to get water for three days now. We have found it difficult to wash some of our blood-stained clothes and other materials that we have used since then. This is very disturbing for a federal hospital.” When City & Crime visited the facility on Monday, the stench from the toilets in most of the wards was a major points of discussion among the patients, with some of them going out of their way to get water for cleaning and other uses. It was also observed that some of the patients who can afford have been moved to the VIP ward. When contacted, the spokesperson of UITH, Mrs Elizabeth Ajibiye, said the situation was occasioned by scarcity of diesel, adding that it was a national issue. She said, “Before now, management had put in place generators that use petrol to power some areas in the clinical. We are on top of the situation and everything has been put in place. Before the close of work today diesel should be available to power the affected generators.”
