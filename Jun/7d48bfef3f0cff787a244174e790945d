According to him, the entire Uturu community is happy that the women are organising prayer sessions together to seek God’s intervention in the killings, kidnappings and banditry taking place at the Ihube junction end of Uturu Okigwe road. He said, “God will grant their prayers because it appears the town is hopeless and helpless. The prayer session is timely and opts to ward off the evil acts by the killers and kidnappers in the town. “There is nothing prayers and God cannot do. With God, all things are possible and we believe that He will hear the mothers’ prayers and save us from these calamities.” Ogbaegbe stated that only a few youths and their leaders were allowed to be in the prayer session to avoid unforeseen circumstances, adding that the youths would join other security officers and personnel to guide and regulate the movement of the women. He urged the women to be peaceful throughout the exercise.
