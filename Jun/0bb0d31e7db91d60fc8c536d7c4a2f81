The FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board is set to commence airlifting the first batch of intending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia on Friday. To this end, the board has directed intending pilgrims from the territory to report at the permanent Hajj Transit Camp at Bassan Jiwa near the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja, immediately. In a statement, the Director of the board, Mallam Muhammad Nasiru Danmallam, said the camping was to prepare the intending pilgrims. Mallam Danmallam informed that the first flight of FCT intending pilgrims was scheduled for Friday and requested those in the first flight to report on Thursday from 10am for the collection of their travel documents and other preparations. He further explained that the intending pilgrims would be subjected to a mandatory PCR test in line with the guidelines for this year’s Hajj by Saudi Arabian authorities, and therefore advised them to report for the exercise and abide by the laid down regulations. He disclosed that the intending pilgrims should check for their flight schedules at the head office of the board in the Central Area, Abuja, or at the Hajj camp to know their schedules. He further said the board had taken measures to ensure compliance of all guidelines for the exercise and had started receiving visas for the 2022 FCT intending pilgrims, while arrangements for the Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) had been concluded. Our correspondent further reports that about 2,000 intending pilgrims from the FCT are expected to be airlifted from the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport for the exercise this year.
