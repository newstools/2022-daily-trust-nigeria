The Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) has said that electricity meters produced in the country or imported do undergo three levels of test to ensure they are suitable for consumer usage. The Managing Director/CEO of NEMSA, Aliyu Tukur, said this was to ensure consumers were not cheated by electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) or easily become defective due to environmental factors. Speaking at a retreat organised for the management staff of NEMSA yesterday, Mr Tukur said meters were modules which had to be accurate always. He said, “So electricity meters have to be qualitative and accurate to avoid cheating of consumers or the utility company selling the products. This is where NEMSA comes in to ensure that these electrical instruments are developed to our own standards and specifications.” On his part, the Chairman of NEMSA Governing Board, Engr Suleiman Yahaya, said the retreat would give insight into the development of the agency and the plans to be able to carry out “our core projects”. He added that it was also seeking how best to improve revenue generation by upholding best practice in the industry.
