A former national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Chekwas Okorie, has urged Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State to intervene and resolve the crisis rocking the party. Okorie, at a press briefing yesterday in Abuja, said it was unfortunate that Dr Victor Oye, still paraded himself as the party’s chairman when there was no lawful national convention of APGA that legitimised his emergence for his second term in office since 2019. According to him, the 2019 convention of APGA held in Imo State, which produced Edozie Njoku as national chairman and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) has been affirmed by the Federal High Court in Abuja as lawful and binding. He warned that the party would suffer a huge defeat which may likely lead to its extinction if the issues are left unaddressed, before the 2023 elections. When contacted, INEC National Electoral Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye, said the commission won’t trade words with anyone.
