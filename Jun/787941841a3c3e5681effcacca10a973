Ola Awoniyi, the Special Adviser to the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has described the viral video purporting that Lawan had defected to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from All Progressives Congress (APC) as false and mischievous. Awoniyi clarified in a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday, that the original video clip was ‘mischievously’ edited to 26 seconds. He said the original video was a three minutes and 30 seconds clip where Lawan read the letter written to the Senate by Sen. Adamu Ailero of Kebbi State, informing them of his defection from APC to PDP over issues in the state chapter of the APC.

The fact is that, at the commencement of the session on Tuesday, the Senate President read out some correspondences, one of which was the said letter written by Sen. Aliero. “Sen. Aliero was not the only senator who officially announced their defection this week from one party to another. It was the video clip of the Senate President reading out Sen. Aliero’s letter that was doctored to give the wrong impression that Lawan has renounced his membership of APC. “For the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Lawan is a committed member of APC and has no reason whatsoever to renounce his membership of the party.” Awoniyi urged members of the public to discountenance the video in reference, describing it as the handiwork of mischief-makers.
