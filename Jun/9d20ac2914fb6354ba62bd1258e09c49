Okija community in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State has invoked the powers of 15 deities to fight gunmen terrorising the area. A viral video shows the villagers trooping out en masse to perform a ritual to that effect. Following the community’s action, City & Crime gathered that some native doctors allegedly working with the gunmen fled the community to evade the wrath of the deities. During the ritual, curses were placed on anybody or any group that attempts to perpetrate or indulge in any crime in the community. The people were led in the cleansing and invocation ritual by the Chief Priest of Ezi-Odinamma Okija, Ozo Calistus Ahize (Onatara Dike Nma). Speaking on the significance of the ritual, Ọzọ Ahize said the community had been fighting insecurity since, noting that Okija land had never been comfortable with the gunmen and other perpetrators of related crimes. He assured that henceforth more spiritual wars and their deities’ wrath were coming down upon such people irrespective of their ethnicity.
