 A group under the aegis of the Northern Christian Youths of Nigeria has asked the top echelon of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate for the 2023 polls, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to pick Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, as running mate. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Kaduna, the Vice President of the group, Calab Goni, called on the youths in the country to stand with one voice to ensure that Lalong filled the vice presidential slot. He explained that Lalong was a grassroots mobiliser and would add value to the country in no small measure if given the mandate. He said, “The APC should not support a Muslim-Muslim ticket as being suggested because it will be giving the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) an upper hand. They should rather consider Lalong as their VP to win the election. “We decided to support Lalong because he has shown he has the interest of the country and the masses at heart. He has been able to suppress the ethnic crises in Plateau State, and with him as governor, Jos North which had always had a Christian as chairman now has a Muslim chairman because Lalong opened the doors for everyone to come in.”
