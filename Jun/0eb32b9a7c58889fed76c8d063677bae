Ameerah, daughter of the abducted Kaduna Kadpoly lecturer, Dr Ramatu Abarshi, has regained freedom after spending 38 days in bandits’ den. She was released on Tuesday and moved to an undisclosed hospital for medical check up, according to a source. Daily Trust reports that Dr Abarshi, her daughter and their driver, Ibrahim, were abducted on April 24, 2022, along Kachia-Kaduna Highway while returning from a Charity mission. While she was released about three weeks ago, the driver regained his freedom last week while the daughter was released five days after the driver. “Yes, the daughter Ameerah was released on Tuesday evening; she reunited with her family before taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical attention. It was not easy but we thanked God she is back home safely,” he said. The source told Daily Trust that the abductors collected ransom that ran into millions.
