President of the Nigerian Youth Union, Comrade Chinonso Obasi has urged elder statesmen in the country to be guided in their comments in order not to heat up the polity. Obasi stated this while addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday about the recent comments by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders’ Forum on the choice of Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa as the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said as elders they should have settled their differences with the governor amicably and not resorted to name-calling. “There are more diplomatic ways of resolving crises without calling people names. Lately, we have observed that these regional speakers speak for themselves and tag it with the position of their region while in the actual sense they are expressing their personal opinion. We advise that they stop heating up the polity,” he said. He said the youths support the move by the PDP to nominate Governor Okowa regardless of the earlier position of the southern governors that the presidency should be zoned to the region.
