A customary court sitting in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has dissolved the marriage between one Mr Ige Iyiola and Mrs Ojo Funmilayo. The petitioner, Iyiola, had dragged Mrs Funmilayo to court to grant him access to the only child of the marriage and for a dissolution of the customary court marriage between them.

She told the court, “I was pregnant for him four times with miscarriages caused by him. “My last miscarriage was in early 2015, and I left his house and had the child in September 2016. “The father of my child is Debo Oluranti, who I met after I left the petitioner.” Mrs Funmilayo agreed that a DNA to determine the paternity of the child should be done. The President of the court, Mrs F. O. Oyeleye, noted that the parties had been separated for seven years and that they had no interest of coming back together. She thereby ordered that the customary marriage contracted by both parties was dissolved, saying they had the right to appeal the judgment within 30 days.
