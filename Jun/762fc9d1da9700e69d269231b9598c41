The Association of Mass Communication Graduates (AMACOG) of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta, Ogun State, has concluded plans to mark its 30th graduation anniversary on Friday July 1, in the school. AMACOG 92, the 1992 graduates of the then Ogun State Polytechnic, Abeokuta, said the visit would allow the old students to support the mass communication department of their alma mater in key areas. In a statement, the Chairman of AMACOG 92, Mr Adekunle Adeshina, stated that the members planned to unveil a television studio which they had renovated and installed modern equipment. Adeshina said, “We can’t allow 30 years of our graduation from the school to pass away unnoticed and uncelebrated.” He said the one-day event would be rounded up with a dinner on Friday, noting that it would allow the old course mates to network and exchange ideas on how to move the association and the department forward. He added that the acting Rector of MAPOLY, Adeoye Odedeji, the Head of Department, Mass Communication, Mr Lekan Togunwa; and the Olota of Ota, Prof Adeyemi Obalanlege, were members of the association.
