 The Kwara State Police Command has called on the leadership of motorcycle and tricycle unions in the state to embark on adequate profiling of existing and new members for easy identification and monitoring. The Commissioner of Police, Tuesday Assayomo, in a statement, said this was necessary in order to check the influx of the banned Okada riders from other states, especially Lagos, to Kwara. In the statement signed by the command’s spokesman, Okasanmi Ajayi, the CP also advised the leaderships of religious bodies and other leaders in the state to “put in place CCTVs in places of worship and employ private or local guards to complement the police.”
