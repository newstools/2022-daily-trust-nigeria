Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said that President Muhammadu Buhari never said that presidency would go to the South in 2023. Yahaya Bello disclosed this while commenting on the recent Northern Governors Forum’s endorsement of power shift to the southern part of the country, when he appeared on Channels TV on Sunday. Ten Northern governors had thrown their weight behind Southern presidency, saying it was fair for another region to take charge after Buhari’s eight years in power. Bello, who said he would accept ‘wholeheartedly’ whosoever the president anointed, said nobody notified him of the Northern governors’ meeting that led to the decision. When asked whether President Buhari said the presidency would be zoned to the South, Bello said, “I don’t know where Mr President made such statement, but I want to tell you categorically that judging from the statement that came out from his spokesmen; Chief Adesina and Alhaji Garba Shehu, I don’t think there is anywhere Mr President made such a statement. “Number two let me put our mind on this. It’s high time we deemphasized this issue of zoning. From day one, I always caution. Here are victims  of bomb blast and shooting in Ondo and several other parts of this country. “Ondo is a town that is hosting the current governor of Ondo State, Akeredolu. Gov Mimiko handed over to him, no such bomb blast ever took place. Now what happened? Will such people be saying our person, our person? No, in the country today we are faced with insecurity. What Nigerians want is who will come and secure them.” Bello added that he would beat the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, if he clinched the APC ticket, saying he is the only person among the aspirants with a clear roadmap.
