There is internal wrangling in the Yobe State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as eight aggrieved aspirants moved to take legal action. The aspirants are dissatisfied with the outcome of the party’s primaries for state and federal constituencies. Already, the APC ticket for Yobe North senatorial seat has been generating controversy as the name of the Senate President Ahmad Lawan, who lost his presidential bid, appeared as the party’s senatorial candidate in a list submitted by the party’s leadership to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Bashir Sheriff Machina, who won the primary election held in Gashua on May 28, 2022, has refused to step down and went ahead to challenge the party’s decision in court. However, another Yobe North senatorial aspirant, Abubakar Abubakar Jinjiri, has also approached the court to challenge the exclusion of his name during the primary election. Eight cases have been filed before Justice Fadima Murtala Aminu of the Federal High Court, Damaturu. They are challenging the outcomes of APC primaries in Fika/Ngalda constituency, Goya/Ngeji constituency, Nangere constituency, Bade West constituency, Jakusko constituency, Potiskum Central constituency, Bade Jakusko federal constituency and Yobe North senatorial zone. The court has fixed July 21, 2022 for hearing.
