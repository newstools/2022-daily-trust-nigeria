The Presidential candidate of the main opposition PDP Atiku Abubakar is yet to pick his running mate, Paul Ibe, Atiku’s media aide said yesterday. Ibe told Daily Trust that the former vice president has not picked a former governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha as being rumoured in some quarters. Atiku emerged PDP candidate for the 2023 presidential poll last week during the party’s presidential primary poll held in Abuja. Following the development, there are speculations over his choice of a running mate. Ibe said, “When we decide to speak on the issue of running mate, it will not be a subject of speculation; we will roll it out. It is not going to be something that will be speculated on the social media, online platforms or WhatsApp groups. “So I cannot confirm that to be true. These are the times for all manner of speculations. People should endeavor to wait for the official announcement. This speculation is unknown to me.”
