Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has appealed to residents of the state who have not collected their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) to do so without further delay. Oyetola made the appeal while speaking during his tour of Iwo Federal Constituency comprising Aiyedire, Iwo and Ola-Oluwa LGAs.

Oyetola said his administration, despite the pockets of challenges, was able to record great things and ensure good governance. In their separate remarks, the Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama; the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul- Rasheed Adewale Akanbi: and the Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Adetoyese Agbajelola, said Oyetola performed well in his fi rst term and promised to ensure his return for a second term. Oba Oyelude told Oyetola that his last achievements would earn him the second term, saying, “You have done excellently well to earn second term. Your re-election is our collective project. We don’t need campaign because your good works have campaigned for you already. “You are a perfect example of the saying, ‘one good turn deserves another’. We don’t have any doubt that you will be returned, and this can be attested to by visible indices. You have used your managerial skills to take us to where we are today. All the awards you earned, you deserved them. We will do all possible to support you.”
