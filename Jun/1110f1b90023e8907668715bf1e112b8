The Association of Pharmaceutical Products Marketers of Nigeria (APPMAN) has charged its members to increase intake of graduate pharmacists in order to reduce unemployment rate in the country. It also said employing qualified pharmacists would strengthen the process of drug dispensation, adding that the association, in collaboration with the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN), would uproot those practicing illegally. The President of APPMAN, Afolabi Nurudeen, disclosed this in Abuja at their end-of-year ceremony organised in honour of immediate past Registrar of PCN, Pharm N. A. E. Mohammed. Nurudeen noted that his association was doing everything possible to ensure that non-registered companies with PCN were not allowed to sell drugs in the country.
