The abducted board member of Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC), Alhaji Isah Ozi-Salami, has been freed by his abductors. Kogi State Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), Mr William Ayah, confirmed his release on Thursday in Lokoja. He said Ozi-Salami, who was kidnapped two weeks ago, was released on Wednesday night by his abductors around 11pm. Ayah added that the HYPPADEC’s boss is hale and hearty, adding that he has since been reunited with his family members in Ogaminana in Adavi local government area of Kogi State. It would be recalled that last Sunday, his abductors called his family members to demand for N120m ransom but our correspondent cannot immediately confirm if money was paid before his release. He was forcefully picked up by unknown gunmen while on his way to the mosque to observe his early morning prayers two weeks ago in his family home at Ogaminana.
