The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has urged the presidential candidates of PDP and APC Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu to allow the true teachings of Islam on peacefulness, truthfulness and honesty guide their footsteps. It called on them to also eschew thuggery, hooliganism, ballot-snatching and election rigging as the 2023 general elections draw closer. The MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, in a statement on Wednesday, charged the duo and other contestants to eschew rigging and run issue-based campaigns. He congratulated them on their victory in the presidential election primaries and commended President Muhammadu Buhari for resisting temptations to be autocratic in his party’s presidential primaries. Akintola, who noted that though the PDP did not abide by the principle of rotation, however, commended the northern politicians in the APC whose leaders unanimously stood by the unwritten principle of rotation thereby making it possible for a southwestern candidate to emerge. He said, “It will be recalled that MURIC had been calling for a Yoruba Muslim president for the past three years. It was this show of solidarity from the North and their readiness to identify with our call that made our dream a fait accompli. “We, therefore, see freedom on the horizon for the Muslims of Yorubaland who have for long been oppressed, down-pressed and repressed.”
