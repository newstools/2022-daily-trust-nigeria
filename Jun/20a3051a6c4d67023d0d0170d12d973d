The Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, has said the federal government has over the years made lots of investments in agriculture to employ and feed the growing population in the country. Speaking at the training of trainers for the National Agricultural Sample Census (NASC) organised by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Wednesday in Abuja, Agba said Nigeria could still be classified as an agrarian society, thus, the sector is integral and essential to the development of the country. by Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Olushola Idowu, the minister said the investment by the federal government has led to the sector recording positive growth despite the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war. “It is because of these investments and attention to this sector that during the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and security challenges being encountered in some parts of the country, the sector has consistently recorded positive GDP numbers growing at 33.16 per cent in real terms in the first quarter of 2022,” he said. Statistician General and CEO of NBS, Prince Adeyemi Adeniran, said the sector alone accounts for approximately 25 per cent of the economy and employs over 50 per cent of the workforce of the country, both directly and indirectly.
