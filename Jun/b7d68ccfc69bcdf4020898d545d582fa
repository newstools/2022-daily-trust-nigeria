A former managing director of Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM BANK), Roberts Orya, has emerged as the governorship candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP) in Benue State. Orya emerged as the party’s flagbearer unopposed during its primary election held in Makurdi. The gubernatorial candidate, in his acceptance speech, assured that education both at primary and secondary levels would be free in Benue if he is elected governor of the state. He also pledged to employ qualified teachers that would provide quality science and technological education for the pupils for a better Benue. Orya added that globally, science and technology are now tools for development. He also stressed on using two-point agenda to address the problems of Benue if voted into power in 2023. “I am coming to address the problems of Benue with a two-point agenda, which is economy and security. I tell you that if you solve the problem of the economy, automatically the problem of security will be solved. “Right now, as it is, your state, Benue has so much debt, salaries have remained unpaid and pensioners are suffering. “Benue needs someone that has deep knowledge of the economy; one who has the desire to develop the state, one who has the capability and experience,” he stressed.
