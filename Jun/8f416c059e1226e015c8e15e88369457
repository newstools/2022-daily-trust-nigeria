As part of its long term strategic growth plan, Nigeria’s retail Point-of-Sale solution provider, ZirooPay will leverage its recent funding round to tap into the growing opportunities in Africa’s retail sector. With the recent  capital injection of $11.4 million, ZirooPay said it is strategically positioned to explore the continent’s growing retail opportunities, especially as the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement, AfCTA with a combined market of 1.2 billion people and a GDP of $2.5 trillion takes off. Speaking recently, The Chief Executive Officer, CEO of ZirooPay, Omoniyi Olawale said innovation payment solutions such as ZirooPay will remain an imperative ad wholesale and retail sectors continue to dominate Africa’s contribution to its GDP, even as population growth and rapid urbanisation continue to drive consumption across the continent. “ZirooPay has set out to build an operating system for retail in Africa by providing solutions that not only drive financial inclusion but also support the payment infrastructure needed for retail to thrive on the continent. Lack of reliable payment technology for the continent remains one of the major challenges that has hindered trade tremendously and ZirooPay Mobile POS solution will address this challenge.” Beyond payments, ZirooPay also provides merchants with automated sales history, sales analytics, and inventory tracking to help them monitor and manage their businesses more efficiently. ZirooPay’s superior transaction success rate and the integrated nature of its service stand it out from the competition. The payment provider, which started operations in Nigeria in 2019, has organically grown to 15,000 merchants processing over $500m in 10m transactions and looks to replicate this success across Africa.
