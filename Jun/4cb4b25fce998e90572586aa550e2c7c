President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Mohammed Bello Shehu as Chairman of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). Buhari, in a letter read by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, at plenary Wednesday, sought the senate’s confirmation of the appointment. Buhari explained that the request was in accordance with the provisions of Section 154 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). He said, “It is my hope that the senate will consider and confirm the nominee in the usual expeditious manner.” Similarly, the Senate President, Lawan, on Wednesday, forwarded Buhari’s request to confirm the nomination of Joe Aniku Michael Ohiani for appointment as substantive Director General/CEO of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) to the Committee on Works. Also forwarded was the president’s request for the confirmation of Umar Yahaya as co-chairman of the governing council of Unclaimed Funds to the Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions. Both nominees are expected to appear before the relevant committees for screening before the committees revert to the senate in two weeks.
