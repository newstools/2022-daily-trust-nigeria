Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari will visit the state next Tuesday to campaign for the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji. Fayemi also said the APC presidential flagbearer, Bola Tinubu; National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu; governors and other critical stakeholders would also storm the state for the campaign. The state governorship poll will hold on June 18, 2022. He said the electoral victory of the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu, would start from the success of the party in the coming Ekiti gubernatorial election. He spoke in Ado-Ekiti, upon his arrival at the state after the APC presidential primary held in Abuja. The governor, a presidential aspirant, said he stepped down for Tinubu to support intentions geared towards the progress and prosperity of the region. “There can be victory in what appears to be a loss. There can be success in what others call failure. We had to act in unity and cohesion for the manifest destiny of Nigeria to arrive, for the unity of Nigeria to be consolidated and for the success of our party to be whole,” he said. Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has constituted a National Campaign Council for Ekiti State Governorship election, to be chaired by Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. The council, according to a statement by PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba in Abuja on Thursday, has Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia as the Deputy Chairman. The party also listed Mr. Adedamola Adegbite as its Administrative Secretary, while other members included Governors Nyesom Wike, Udom Emmanuel, Amb.  Taofeek Arapaja and Sen. Samuel Anyanwu among others. The party added that the date for the inaugural meeting of the council and other details would be announced in due course.
