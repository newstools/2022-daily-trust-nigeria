But the coalition said the extension of the deadline would enable more eligible voters be accommodated democratically. Eze said instead of INEC’s one-week extension of political party primaries, “the more widely acceptable option would have been an extension for the continuous voter registration cum online pre-registration deadline to give room for more Nigerians to exercise their franchise.
