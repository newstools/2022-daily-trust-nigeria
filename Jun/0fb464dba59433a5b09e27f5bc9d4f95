Executive Chairman, Butane Energy Limited, Alhaji Isa Mohammed Inuwa, said their new Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) bottling and storage plant in Katsina has offered a choice and stable product supply to consumers in the state. Speaking during an interview in Abuja yesterday, Alhaji Inuwa, a former Group Executive Director with the defunct Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, said: “We have now provided consumers with choice and stable supply of gas in Katsina and I can say that since we began operation, we have never ran out of stock.” APC group asks Tinubu to pick Niger gov as running mate Reserve plunges by $2.9bn as banks tighten forex Inuwa also lauded the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB) for its equity investment fund which his firm benefited from for the investment. He also noted that plans are ongoing to create four other plants across Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Abuja in the first phase of expansion and that the firm has procured all equipment for the expansion which would boost its capacity and create more jobs across the states. While the Butane Energy boss said the firm was being prudent in reducing its landing cost and crash LPG retail price, he however said the rising cost of logistics occasioned by high diesel price, poor road infrastructure, forex issues and import issues are hurdles to the business. He also added that the influx of LPG from the Niger Republic with Low Heat Value (LHV) was another issue that needed to be tackled for the domestic gas market to thrive. Alhaji Inuwa called for the Federal Government’s intervention by reducing taxes for the investors, banning the import of low-quality gas, improve on road infrastructure and increasing cheap funding like the NCDMB Fund.
