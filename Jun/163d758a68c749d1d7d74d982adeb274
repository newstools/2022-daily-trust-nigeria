The Senator representing Ebonyi Central, Obinna Ogba, has won the governorship ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state for the 2023 general elections. Chairman of the electoral committee, Chris Okolo, said Senator Ogba polled 253 votes to defeat other aspirants, including his closest rival, Edwin Anayo, a House of Representatives member, who garnered 110 votes. Speaking after clinching the party’s ticket, Ogba said, “This victory is for all of us, and that is why I am bored to say there is no victor, no vanquished. We shall walk together as one indivisible party to win in the general elections next year.”
