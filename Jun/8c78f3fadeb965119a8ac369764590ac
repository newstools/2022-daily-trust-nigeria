Nigeria’s commodities market player and first private sector commodities exchange, AFEX has committed to feeding an additional one million households over the next one year. The commitment was made in commemoration of this year’s World Hunger Day. The World Hunger Day is an internationally recognized day of awareness focused on tackling the global hunger crisis. The United Nations (UN) estimated that in 2021 alone, up to 811m people experienced hunger. AFEX said it has helped smallholder farmers grow their income by 400 per cent, within 2-3years while it has worked with over 350,000 farmers and traded 600,000MT worth of commodities, which in turn has resulted in the company feeding over 4m households. The CEO of AFEX, Ayodeji Balogun therefore stated that the company is focused on helping an additional one million households to avoid hunger in the coming year. He said, “What our food producers do is to ensure that Africa is fed, and our mission is to ensure that an additional one million households over the course of the next year don’t go hungry.”
