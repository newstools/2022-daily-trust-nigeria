The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has described a social media post that the commission has ‘21 INEC registration centres in the Republic of Niger’ as false and unsubstantiated. Mr. Rotimi Lawrence Oyekanmi, the chief press secretary to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said yesterday in Abuja that such post and similar falsehoods should be ignored by the public. There have been calls for INEC to extend the June 30 deadline for the continuous voter registration (CVR) amidst a court ruling asking INEC not to close the CVR registration. A Twitter user, Nche Nwanbunike has posted that INEC was having 21 voter registration units in the neighbouring Niger Republic and also blaming the nation’s media for being silent on the matter. However, reacting to the claim Mr. Oyekanmi, said, “The post was an unsubstantiated allegation made by a Twitter user, Nche Nwanbunike. The person who made such post should be asked to prove it.”
