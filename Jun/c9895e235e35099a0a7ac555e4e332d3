The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has barred village chiefs, ward heads and district heads from the use of the prefix “His Royal Highness (HRH)”. Alhaji Yunusa said only the 17 upgraded traditional rulers in the FCT were entitled to the use of the prefix. He spoke at the three-day fidau prayers for the late Chief of Pai, Alhaji Abdullahi Bala Pai, who died on Saturday, at the age of 86 after a protracted illness. He frowned at the way and manner some village chiefs and district heads are using the prefix, HRH, on their private vehicles and motorcycles, especially in Kwali Chiefdom. He, therefore, called on the Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Danladi Chiya, to caution such village chiefs, district heads and ward heads to desist from using HRH. He prayed for repose of the late Pai chief, even as he urged his family members to remain united. Alhaji Yunusa disclosed that the process of selecting a new chief would be carried out transparently. Also speaking, the Chairman of Kwali, Danladi Chiya, said the death of the Pai chief had created a vacuum and prayed for his soul.
