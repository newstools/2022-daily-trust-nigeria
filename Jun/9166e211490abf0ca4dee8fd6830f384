The Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has disclosed plans by his administration to constitute a high-powered committee that will reconcile all the aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. The state’s chapter of the party is enmeshed in a crisis following the outcome of the recently conducted primaries in the state. The governor revealed this yesterday when he presided over the monthly State Executive Council (SEC) meeting at the Government House, Lafia. He said, “Anyone who feels very strongly that they have not been treated fairly, there are proper procedures to address such issues. I am appealing to our members that very soon we are going to set up a high-powered committee that is going to go around and speak with various members of the party and hear how they feel about what has happened and see how best to address those issues.”
