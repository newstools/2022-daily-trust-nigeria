At least 5,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The defectors are believed to be loyalists of the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Ladi Adebutu and late Senator Buruji Kashamu from Iperu, Ikenne Local Government Area of the state. A statement yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary to the state governor, Kunle Somorin, said Governor Dapo Abiodun received the defectors into the party. Led by lfaneye Shittu, lsiaka Sonoiki and Mufutau Gbadamosi from the Ladi Adebutu faction as well as Adeleke Adesanya, the chairmanship candidate of the party from Buruji group, at a political meeting, the defectors cited the sterling performance of the state governor as the reason for their action. Receiving the former PDP members, Abiodun thanked them for joining the ruling party, stating that the inclusiveness and open-door policy being adopted by the current administration has attracted many members of other political parties to pitch their tent with the APC. “I want to assure you that you will be given equal treatment as every member of the party is one family. This government is your government and we are ready to accommodate whoever is ready to join hands with us towards the development of the state irrespective of religious, political or tribal affiliation. “Our party is focused and committed to the transformation of the state. Since the inception of the current administration, a lot of developmental projects, including road reconstruction, rehabilitation of primary health centres, youth empowerment among others had been carried out in all the three senatorial districts of the state. We are currently constructing the Gateway Cargo Airport, which was delayed by the previous administrations for more than a decade and by God’s grace, it will be ready for commissioning by December this year”, the governor stated.
