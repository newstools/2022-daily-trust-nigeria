The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Anambra, has expressed worry over the erosion menace ravaging its Permanent Orientation Camp in Umuawulu/Mbaukwu, Awka South Local Government Area. Mrs Blessing Iruma, the NYSC State Coordinator, raised the alarm at the swearing-in ceremony of 2022 Batch B, stream 1 orientation course on Tuesday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 791 males and 1,029 females were sworn in for the service year in Anambra. Iruma expressed regrets that the continued existence and integrity of some of the structures in the camp were being threatened by the erosion. The scheme appealed to Gov. Chukwuma Soludo to rescue the camp by completing the remaining parts of the project which include landscaping of the premises. (NAN)
