The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has commenced training of political party officials on the use of the redesigned INEC’s Candidate Nomination Portal (ICNP) in preparation for the 2023 general elections. The Candidate Nomination Portal is one of the technological innovations introduced by the commission in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce physical interactions and automate its processes. Speaking at the opening of the four-day training workshop yesterday in Abuja, INEC National Commissioner and Chairperson of the Legal Services, Clearance and Complaints Committee (LSC&CC), Mrs. May Agbamuche-Mbu, said the Electoral Act, 2022 makes provision for several technological innovations and gives the commission a general discretion to apply technology as it sees fit. The training was organised with support from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). She said the portal was recently redesigned to accommodate the greater demands of a wider, general election nomination process. She said, “This training is of utmost importance to political parties as it will enlighten them on the guidelines for nomination of candidates and the new procedure of the ICNP bearing in mind that political parties will be submitting forms on the portal in respect of candidates they intend to sponsor for the various offices in 1,499 constituencies in Nigeria.”
