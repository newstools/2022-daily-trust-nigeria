The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Monday night, shunned members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and governors who are members of the party. The governors met with the APC NWC members to discuss the way forward for the party’s consensus candidate ahead of its presidential primary slated for today. Adamu was conspicuously absent at the meeting, which lasted for about 40 minutes at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja. Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, is reported to be backing Senate President Ahmad Lawan while other members of the NWC and the governors from the North and South are agitating for a presidential candidate of southern extraction. The Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari who was asked by newsmen to speak on the outcome of their brief meeting with the governors simply said, “We are yet to reach decision on consensus.” Kano State governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Aminu Masari (Katsina), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Simon Lalong (Plateau) and many others were at the meeting.
