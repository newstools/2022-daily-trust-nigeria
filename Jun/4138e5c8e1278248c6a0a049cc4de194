The Nigeria Political Science Association (NPSA) has advised Nigerians and the political class to stop dissipating energy on the issue of a Muslim/Muslim ticket. The polity has been heated up over the likelihood of a Muslim/Muslim ticket by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). While the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has rejected the idea and warned parties against it, some stakeholders have asked Nigerians to focus more on competence than sentiment. Addressing journalists in Ilorin, Kwara State, the President of NPSA, Professor Hassan Saliu, urged Nigerians to rather channel their energy on how to vote leaders who would fix the country. He said, “Nigerians should preoccupy themselves on how to elect the person that knows how to fix the country as president in 2023 instead of dissipating energy on Muslim/Muslim ticket.” According to him, Nigeria needs a president that will restore dignity of the country, uphold the rule of law, constitution and fundamental human rights. He further said, “What the NPSA is after is the election of a president that knows how to fix Nigeria and whose body language will not influence government decisions on national issues.” He added that security challenges across the nation’s geopolitical zones were as a result of political exclusiveness.
