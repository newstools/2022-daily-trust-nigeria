The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has consoled his colleagues who failed to secure return tickets of their political parties to contest in the 2023 general elections. Lawan gave his message at the resumption of senate’s plenary yesterday in a remark to welcome the lawmakers from break. The red chamber suspended plenary on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, to enable its members participate in the primaries of their political parties. Lawan, who contested for the APC presidential ticket, and over 20 other lawmakers who contested various offices were defeated at the primaries conducted across the country between May and June. The senate president urged the senators who lost out in the primaries not to lose hope but remain committed to the political system of their respective parties not minding the outcomes of the just concluded primaries. Lawan said there was the need for the senate to prioritise the nation’s security challenges, as well as undertake further amendment of the Electoral Act, noting that the electoral process in the just concluded primaries had thrown up issues that must be critically looked at by the National Assembly. He said, “Some of us participated in the congresses for their senatorial districts, some of our colleagues went for governorship of their states, and four of us went for the presidency of our great country. “We have recorded different results from those activities, but as politicians, it is never over until it is over. We should continue to support the political system that we believe in. Those of our colleagues who have recorded successes, we wish them more successes in the general elections.”
