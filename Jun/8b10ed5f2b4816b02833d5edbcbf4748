Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has expressed joy over reuniting with Precious Chikwendu, his estranged wife, and her four sons after almost two years of being apart. The tussle for the custody of their four children, who have been in their father’s care, has been a heated one. In December, 2021, Chikwendu lamented that her ex-husband had frustrated all attempts to see her kids over the past year. “The children are with him, I haven’t seen them since August 2nd, 2020. Yes, since August 2nd, 2020, I haven’t seen my children and I’ve been physically prevented from seeing them,” she said. Responding to the accusation, FFK had countered his ex-wife noting she had been granted access to the kids for over 17 months but has willfully refused to visit them. “Their mother has been given access to see them in the house for the last one year and five months but she has refused to do so,” he said. In a new development on Friday, Precious finally got a chance to visit her four sons at Fani-Kayode’s house and the former Aviation Minister shared photos on Instagram. “It was the dramatic return of a great and beautiful queen who was simply resplendent and who shone as brightly as the morning star. “There are some moments that words cannot capture or express and this was one of them.” “Mama Aragorn displayed such courage, grace, dignity & class. This was a moment that light overcame darkness & that the secret prayers of four handsome little Princes were answered,” the caption of the photos read in part.
