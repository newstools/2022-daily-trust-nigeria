 National coordinator and founder of Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) Project 2023 in Nasarawa State, Umar Yakubu-Yunusa, has said Tinubu who is the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 general election would end terrorism and other forms of insecurity if given the mandate. He stated this during a meeting with members of the Tinubu Support Group who were in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, to strategise for his victory at the 2023 poll. He said Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, has the experience and tact to end the security challenges bedevilling the country, adding that he is the best man to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. “Tinubu has come with a coherent vision on how to improve the nation, such that our schools, industry, agriculture and infrastructure will become the pride of all. “We saw what he did in Lagos State as the then governor. He has the capacity to end the security situation across the country and by the special grace of God, by the time he becomes the president of this country, I believe everybody will sleep with his or her two eyes closed. “The security situation in Lagos was terribly bad before he became the governor of the state and was able to handle the situation,” he said.
