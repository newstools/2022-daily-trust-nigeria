Voting was temporarily suspended at the convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Eagle Square, Abuja, on Wednesday. The exercise was put on hold as Kano delegates were casting their ballot in the keenly contested exercise. Chairman of Kano APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas, was seen arguing with some officials before voting was suspended. Less than 20 of the 127 delegates from Kano had voted before the exercise was suspended.
