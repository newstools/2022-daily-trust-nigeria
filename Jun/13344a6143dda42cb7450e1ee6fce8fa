The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has disowned a document in circulation purported to be his manifesto for the 2023 campaign. Tinubu, the APC national leader, explained that he has not endorsed the document as his manifesto, adding that it was a mere draft proposal and suggestions on the programmes he should implement if elected in February 2023. 30-year-old threatens to behead dad, step-mum in Kwara Many killed in Benue attacks, houses set on fire In a statement on Sunday, the Director of Media and Communications, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, said Tinubu’s manifesto must be a more serious document than the one in circulation. Part of the statement reads: “I want to place it on record that the manifesto being circulated via social media platforms and already published by a section of the mainstream media is not the official manifesto of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and APC for the 2023 general elections. “While our presidential candidate appreciates the spirit and efforts of his associates that produced the document being passed around mostly on WhatsApp, we want to clearly state that the document is an unofficial document and Tinubu cannot be held accountable on any of the issues raised in the document. “The presidential candidate and APC are currently working on an all-embracing manifesto that will inspire the confidence of Nigerians. When the official policy document of Tinubu is ready it will be formally presented to Nigerians and our candidate will be in a position to defend every word that will be contained therein. “We appreciate the interest and enthusiasm of Nigerians to know about the programmes and policy options Asiwaju Tinubu will pursue in government when elected.”
