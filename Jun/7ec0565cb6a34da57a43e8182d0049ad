An Ikeja magistrates’ court on Tuesday ordered the remand of a 38-year-old man, Sola Lawson, who allegedly touched his 17-year-old daughter’s breast and thereafter defiled her. The Magistrate, Mrs O. A. Layinka, who did not take Lawson’s plea, directed the police to send the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for advice and adjourned to July 7. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that Lawson committed the offence between 2019 and 2021 at his residence. He said the matter was reported at the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Agency, Alausa, that Lawson unlawfully had sexual intercourse with her twice and that her mother who was aware refused to take any legal action.
