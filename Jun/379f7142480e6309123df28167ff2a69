A former governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kwara State, Prof. Shuaib Abdulraheem Oba, has joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Oba was a leading figure of the Otoge movement during the 2019 election in Kwara State. Also, a former aide to Kwara State governor on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Alhaji Ope Saraki, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to NNPP. Ope Saraki is a cousin to the former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. Speaking at an event to welcome them to NNPP, Oba said he joined the party because of its integrity which, he said, was lacking in other political parties. “In Mallam Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, our presidential candidate, we have a man of integrity who is ready to sacrifice for the betterment of the nation. NNPP is the party that will guarantee a new Kwara and the Nigeria of our dreams,” he said. Also, Ope Saraki said his association with the NNPP should not be a surprise. Asked why he left the PDP and his cousin, Ope said: “I am a Nigerian and I have freedom of interaction and can decide to join and interact with any political party for the progress of the people. In our presidential candidate, Mallam Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, we see a new Nigeria.” Meanwhile, the state NNPP chairman, AbdulRazaq Abdulsalam, said the party has picked Oba as its gubernatorial candidate for the 2023 election. “We have picked Prof. Shuaib Oba as our governorship candidate for 2023 in Kwara State. “He will be attending the meeting of all the NNPP gubernatorial candidates in Abuja on Tuesday (Today),” he added.
