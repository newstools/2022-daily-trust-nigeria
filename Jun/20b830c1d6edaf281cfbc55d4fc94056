A chieftain of the PDP who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the lawmakers failed to get the return tickets because of their low-level performance in their various constituencies, while some were not on the same page with the governor. He added that internal and consensus arrangements from home denied most PDP lawmakers the tickets. He further said, “Yes, in a democracy, we can’t rule things like that out. You can’t expect every one of them to get return tickets. They come from different constituencies and they didn’t perform the same way.”
