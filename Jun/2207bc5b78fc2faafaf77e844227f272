The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State, Prof Sandy Onor, has said there was apprehension in the PDP over the emergence of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, as the party’s presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. Tinubu emerged as the APC flag-bearer at a special convention of the ruling party held from June 7 to 8, after scoring 1,271 votes to beat 13 other contenders for the party’s ticket.

He said the PDP had to now work hard to unite in order to defeat the APC in 2023 and reclaim power so that it could deliver dividends of democracy to the people. He said, “The emergence of the former Lagos State Governor, Alhaji Bola Tinubu, was what we did not expect. We did not want that to happen.” He, however, expressed optimism that with a former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, as the PDP presidential candidate, the opposition party would dislodge the APC. Onor added that the choice of their running mates would be another big factor that would impact the presidential election next year.
