The embattled Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engr Rauf Olaniyan, has approached the state High Court to stall the impeachment process instituted by the State House of Assembly. Daily Trust reports that 24 of the 32 members of the State House of Assembly had in a petition accused the deputy governor of “Gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office, official duty, insubordination and other offences.” It was gathered that the deputy governor has responded to all the allegations raised in the petition through his legal counsel, Chief Afolabi Fashanu, SAN. The Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Hon. Kazeem Olayanju, who confirmed the response, said the matter would be discussed when the House reconvenes on Wednesday (today). However, the development took another dimension on Tuesday when Olaniyan approached the court with prayers, seeking the order of the court to stop the House of Assembly from carrying on with the impeachment process. The case has been adjourned till today (Wednesday). The court ordered that the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, and the clerk be put on notice about the litigation.
