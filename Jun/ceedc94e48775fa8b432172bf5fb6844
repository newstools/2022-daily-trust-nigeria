A dead new born baby was on Thursday morning found dumped on the busy Ayobo Road in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the body was wrapped with flannel and surrounded with dirt. A resident said, “The body is wrapped with a hospital flannel, which means the mother was discharged from a hospital. “The newborn must have died of cold because the flannel which the mother used to wrap him/her got removed thereby exposing the baby to cold. NAN reports that the Deputy Divisional Police Officer of Ayobo, who refused to mention his name, said his men had been drafted to the scene. (NAN)
