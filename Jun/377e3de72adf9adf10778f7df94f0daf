 Osun State Muslim Community has appealed to residents of the state to conduct themselves peacefully before, during and after the forthcoming governorship election in the state. President of the group, Alhaji Mustafa Olawuyi, made the appeal during a press conference in Osogbo, the state capital, to herald OSMC 25th commemoration. Olawuyi appealed to politicians in the state to shun vote buying, violence and any act capable of threatening the peace of the state during the election. He also called on residents to collect their PVCs and vote for candidates of their choice during the election. He said OSMC was engaging governorship candidates to know their plans for the state and promised to step up the advocacy for the collection of PVCs and intensify the campaign for a peaceful election.
