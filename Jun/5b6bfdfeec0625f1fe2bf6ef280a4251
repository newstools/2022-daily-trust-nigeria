The Member of the House of Representatives representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa in Oyo State, Shina Peller, has joined the Accord Party (AP). Peller had last week renounced his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over “the undemocratic actions of some gladiators within Oyo State APC” who he alleged were determined to take the youths and the majority for granted. His decision to join AP was disclosed in a statement by his spokesman, Kola Popoola, yesterday in Abuja. According to the statement, the lawmaker has formally informed the leadership of the house of the development. Peller said he settled for AP which he noted had shown commitment to the yearnings of the people of Ogun; being the first party in Oyo State to zone Oyo North Senatorial ticket to the region.
