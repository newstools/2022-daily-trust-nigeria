There are up to 24 active Gencos on the grid system, but even from the 13 GenCos on Sunday evening, only Delta (Ughelli) GenCo did up to 371MW; Rivers IPP had 156MW, Omotosho did 130MW, Olorunsogo did 128MW while the other nine GenCos did not generate up to 100MW. “Sadly, the baseload GenCos which are the three hydropower plants that guarantee stable electricity were affected. While Kainji had 51MW, Jebba had 88MW and Shiroro was down, some 45 minutes before the national grid collapsed,” said the official. Reports from the Nigeria System Operations, a section of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and grid manager, indicate that there has been a lull in power generation. The highest generation on Saturday was 3,685MW, also being the highest electricity generated in Nigeria for a week (since Sunday 5th June). As of when filing this report, TCN was yet to officially issue a report on the remote and immediate cause of the grid collapse. But an official told this paper that the restoration process has intensified with power being restored to Abuja and some states, first.
