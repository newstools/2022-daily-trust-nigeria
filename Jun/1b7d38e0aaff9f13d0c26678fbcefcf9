The Benue Youth Forum (BYF), the umbrella body of Benue State youths, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) never conducted any primary election in the state. President of the forum, Terrence Kuanum, told newsmen on Thursday in Abuja that the declaration of Rev Fr Hyacinth Alia as the APC candidate is a nullity. Th is is coming on the heels of the APC Benue State Publicity Secretary, Daniel Ihomun, insisting that Alia’s candidature as APC governorship fl agbearer remains valid. Kuanum said the forum had documentary evidence that the APC had no governorship candidate due to its failure to submit its register of members in Vandeikya and Katsina Ala local governments to the appropriate authorities. “Th is means that the purported APC candidate is not a member of APC having not being in a register of the party and therefore cannot stand election. Since the deadline for the conduct of party primaries has elapsed, parading any governorship candidate for the APC is a nullity,” he said.
