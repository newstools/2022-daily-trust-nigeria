The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirants in Zamfara State have petitioned the party’s National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, calling for the cancellation of the primary, which produced Dauda Lawal Dare as the flagbearer. The aspirants, Ibrahim Shehu Gusau, Wadatau Madawaki and Aliyu Hafiz Muhammad, alleged that the exercise, conducted 25 May 2022, was marred by irregularities. In the petition, they accused the state Chairman, Col. Bala Mande (rtd) of working for his preferred candidate, Dauda Dare who, they said, was barely three days old in the party when he contested the primary. The petitioners, through their solicitor, Ibrahim Ali Esq, also alleged that the list of delegates was doctored and that genuine voters (PDP members) were replaced with supporters of Dare, who are All Progressives Congress (APC) members. “The primary election conducted on Wednesday 25 May 2022 was in clear violation of chapter 8 section 50 (3) of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) constitution 2017 as amended, which states categorically that three delegates to state congress one of which shall be a woman to participate in the election. “To our dismay, on the day of the election all the women were replaced by men who were not card-carrying members of our party,” they said.
