A former Minister of Science and Technology and a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ogbonnaya Onu, yesterday promised to create jobs and end poverty if elected president in 2023. Onu, who spoke through his Edo State Campaign Coordinator, Salisu Momoh, made the pledge in Benin, the state capital while seeking the support of the party’s delegates. He said: “Nigeria has the key to unlock the prosperity of the nation. The key is knowledge economy driven by science, technology and innovation. “We must be self-reliant. We can no longer continue to depend on other countries to solve our problems. We have to deploy science and technology for nation-building. This is the roadmap that we must take if elected.” He said Onu joined the presidential race because he was passionate about the growth and development of the country. “He has the knowledge, experience as well as the credibility and vision to lead the nation out of the current challenges,” Momoh said. He said Nigerians must join hands together to promote discipline, justice, fairness and equity and allow creativity to flourish. “Nigeria must be a producing nation instead of a consumer nation. We must produce what we need. We have what it takes to achieve this. It is by doing this that we can create wealth and defeat poverty for a prosperous nation,” he added
