 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has discovered 29,000 multiple registrations for the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) in Kwara State. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mallam Garba Attahiru, said 50 per cent of those who registered for the PVC between June and December last year did multiple registrations. Attahiru disclosed this in Ilorin yesterday at a lecture organised by the Michael Imoudu Institute for Labour Studies (MINILS) to mark this year’s Democracy Day. He said, “We have 29,000 multiple registrations in Kwara State so far. 50 per cent of those who registered for PVC between June and December did multiple registrations. The fine for multiple registration is one year imprisonment or N1m or both. Those affected cannot get their PVC.” Attahiru, who warned politicians against buying PVCs, added that, “You can buy PVCs, but you can’t use them. Technology has been put in place to detect multiple registrations.” He further said the 2023 elections would be the best ever conducted in Nigeria. He added that, “Collation officers cannot tamper with the election results any longer. We will transmit results electronically. In 2019, we relied on the integrity of the retuning officers and other electoral officers for transparent elections.”
