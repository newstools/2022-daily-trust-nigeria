The FCT Administration (FCTA), through its Social Development Secretariat, has concluded plans to graduate over 120 beggars who are undergoing training in various vocational skills. The FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu, revealed this at a routine assessment of the secretariat on Tuesday in Abuja. The trainees, who were beggars, were picked from major streets of Abuja and rehabilitated at the Bwari Vocational Training Centre. Dr Ramatu said the training was part of measures to implement a strategy towards the realisation of President Muhammadu Buhari’s promise to take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty. Earlier, the Head of Ceramics of the secretariat, Mr Stephen Mordi, revealed that since 2015, he had graduated over 120 youths yearly. Mordi added that he was currently training five students from different higher institutions posted to the secretariat for industrial training.
