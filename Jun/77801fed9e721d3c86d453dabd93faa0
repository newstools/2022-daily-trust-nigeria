The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday presented the Certificate of Return to the party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Atiku, a former vice president, won the party’s presidential ticket at a special national convention last weekend in Abuja. Governors, governorship candidates, presidential aspirants, members of the Board of Trustees (BoT), members of the National Assembly and other stakeholders of the party attended the ceremony held at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja. Speaking after receiving the certificate, Atiku pleaded with the party’s NWC to bring everyone on board towards wresting power from the APC. He said, “We should not take their defeat for granted. We must unite and work extremely hard for every single vote in this country. There is so much to do, and there is very little time to waste. So, let’s get to work. “Let us all remember that what just happened is a contest within a family to decide how to put our best foot forward. The main contest is the one to win the presidency of our country for our party. “It will require the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathisers. We must pull everyone together. Nobody should be excluded. “I have already visited some of those who contested against me as a way to lead in that effort to unify the party so that we can face our real opponents, defeat them in the elections and begin the process of rescuing and rebuilding this country from the callous and dangerous APC misrule over the past seven years which is there for everyone to see.” Earlier, the PDP National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, said, “There was no victor, no vanquished. It is the party that won. Atiku Abubakar is not yet victorious. He has only been produced as our candidate.”
