The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, disclosed this Tuesday in Abuja at the official flag-off ceremony of the Service–Wide Financial Literacy Programme in the workplace on Financial Inclusion in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN) and other relevant stakeholders. Represented at the event by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mallam Aliyu Ahmed, the minister said the pilot stage will have 12,000 staff in the ministry benefit from the training but plans are underway to extend the opportunity to all federal ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). “The ministry intends to extend the programme to other MDAs in January 2023,” she said adding that she has requested the Head of Civil Service of the Federation to mandate other MDAs to cooperate with the implementation of the programme to empower the targeted civil servants with final literacy empowerment. She noted that “there is a great concern on how government employees manage their finances. These days public employees face serious financial challenges as a result of the dwindling economy. Studies have shown that lack of primary skills on how to manage money, save and invest is one of the reasons public employees experience financial troubles.”
