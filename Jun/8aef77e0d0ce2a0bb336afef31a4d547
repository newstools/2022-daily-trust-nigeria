OMO, Unilever’s generational and innovative detergent brand, has donated thousands of clothing and household items to NGOs in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kwara and Lagos targeted at empowering vulnerable groups through its “Lend A Hand Of Care”. The campaign, which began with a call for Nigerians to donate pre-loved clothing materials during the last Ramadan season, saw the brand receive over 10,000 pieces of clothing across the country. OMO’s Brand Manager, Chinonyerem Opara, said, “OMO ‘Lend A Hand Of Care’ campaign started during the season of Ramadan when we saw a need to give back to society. “We asked the public to donate clothes to enable us to provide clothing to the less privileged or people that cannot afford good or decent clothes. We are immensely grateful to the well-meaning Nigerians who answered the call and made this possible.”
