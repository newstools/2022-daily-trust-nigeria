Women have called on stakeholders across the country to do more for the training of the girl child at all levels. The National President of the Market Women Association of Nigeria, Mrs Felicia Sani, stated this on Tuesday during the 2022 World Poetry Day organised for school girls in the FCT by Helpline Foundation for the Needy in Abuja. She said the girl child remained the hope and future of Nigeria, hence that necessary steps should be put in place for their academic success. Mrs Sani called on the girl child to be bold, brave but humble anywhere she found herself. She said parents and stakeholders should provide the enabling environment for the girl child at all levels to succeed in her education pursuit, noting that the future of Nigeria depended on the contribution of the girl child; which must be taken serious. She further said, “Women are the neck of the nation; they carry men on their neck, so there is every need to support and encourage them.” In her remarks, Cecilia Kadiri, who spoke on behalf of Helpline Foundation, said the initiative was to encourage children to be committed to their studies, especially the girl child. On her part, a co-convener of the poetry day and corps member, Fatima Nuhu, explained that, “There is a lot of patriarchy and problems associated with the girl child. She said, “We want a situation where we can have a better future for girl child education in Nigeria.’’
