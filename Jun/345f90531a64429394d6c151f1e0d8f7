A senatorial aspirant for Nasarawa West on the platform of the APC, Barrister Labaran Shuaibu Magaji, has said he will not succumb to any “shoddy and illegal” primary election. He said he is still in the race despite the pressure on him to withdraw, adding that the delegates’ list was being manipulated to favour a particular aspirant hence the postponement of the exercise. Magaji, a senior lawyer, told our reporter in an exclusive interview yesterday in Abuja, that following the postponement of the primary poll in the Nasarawa West zone, stakeholders of the party are to meet to pick a new date. He said, “And that is why I insisted that as a criminal law expert, I will not allow such illegal process of primaries to take place under the present democratic setting. “Nasarawa State APC stakeholders and party executives will meet to deliberate on fixing another date for the primaries.”
