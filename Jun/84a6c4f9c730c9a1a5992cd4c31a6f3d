The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Thursday met with 99 presidential delegates from Oyo State ahead of the presidential primary of the party. He promised to resolve the crisis that emanated from the party’s governorship primaries in the state. In his entourage to the state were Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, his Lagos State counterpart, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; former Borno State governor, Kashim Shettima; Lagos State speaker, Mudashiru Obasa; Senator Ridwan Akanbi; and Senator Dayo Adeyeye. Others included Senator Fatai Buhari, the Oyo central senatorial district candidate, Dr. Yinus Akintunde, and APC governorship candidate in Katsina State, Dikko Umaru among others. Speaking at the meeting, Tinubu who sought the confirmation of the stakeholders on the candidature of Folarin, said the leadership of the party would go by the collective decision of members. The presidential aspirant, who is optimistic of his victory on Monday at the national convention in Abuja, said as a way out of the present crisis, a reconciliation/peace committee would be set up to proffer lasting solution to the issue. In a related development, Tinubu has endorsed the candidacies of Dapo Lam Adesina and Olamiju Adebayo Alao Akala for the House of Representatives and Idris Ajimobi for the House of Assembly.
