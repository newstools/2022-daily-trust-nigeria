The European Union (EU) Ambassador to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Samuela Isopi, has said that low participation of youths in elections is a challenge to democracy in Nigeria. Speaking during an interview on Arise TV at the weekend, Isopi said apathy was one of the key points of the recommendations of the European Electoral Observation Mission. She said, “When you have a population that is composed of 80 per cent, 70 per cent of young people and you see that the interest for elections is very low and they do not participate, that is a problem, and so we felt, together with INEC and the civil society, that we should do something. “The message is to remain engaged, and most importantly they have to vote on the days of elections. This is the message today; don’t sell your vote.” She further said, “We are also in partnership with the other partners. For example, the United States is working with the same civil society, YIAGA, to mobilise young people in the rural areas, especially young people in the North. Not just music, but other means to reach out to them.” The ambassador noted that Nigeria must get the 2023 elections right considering the effect it would have on the West African sub region. She said, “The political development in the region is not good for the country and the continent. We want Nigeria to get it right. Nigeria according to the latest figures I got from INEC has 80 million registered voters; which is more than all the voters in West Africa. It is important that these elections are good, peaceful, credible and transparent.”
