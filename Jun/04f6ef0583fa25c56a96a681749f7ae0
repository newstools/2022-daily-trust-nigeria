A presidential candidate under the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Kola Abiola, stated why he wants to be the president of Nigeria by contesting in the next presidential election come 2023. Abiola who is the first child of late M.K.O Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 annulled presidential election, said he wanted to “reset” Nigeria with his party, which is one of the oldest in the country. He said this while speaking on Arise TV about his candidacy and issues surrounding the 2023 general elections on Monday. He said, “I want to be president because I believe it is time for complete reset of Nigeria. And I did not make any mistake by joining PRP. I did my homework thoroughly before joining the PRP. And I joined it because it is the only party that has no baggage, no problems or legacy issues. It is the only party that can convince the younger generation to get involved in the game, and not just to elect leaders.” Abiola also said he was not intimidated by other more popular candidates from other political parties, saying he was confident of his chances to win them even in the North. “The chances of Kola Abiola is a surprise factor. Check the whole northern states, Kaduna, Katsina, Kano, Jigawa states, I will win those states again for PRP,” he said. Kola Abiola had emerged the PRP presidential candidate on June 6, after a keenly contested primary election, in which the party’s delegates from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory voted the aspirants from their respective states. While Abiola got 2,097 votes from across the 36 states including the FCT, his contenders which included Dr Usman Bugaje came second with 813 votes, while Ms Key and Mr Mosugu got 329 and 263 votes to emerge third and fourth, respectively.
