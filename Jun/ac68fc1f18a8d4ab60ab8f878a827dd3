The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, has appealed to traditional rulers in the state to support his ambition. He said he joined the race to collaborate with the monarchs to better the lives of the people. Oyebanji spoke yesterday at a meeting with the monarchs in Ado-Ekiti. He recalled how the traditional leaders laboured and sacrificed their comfort to actualise the creation of Ekiti in 1996. Oyebanji assured them that he would accord them the necessary respect and ensure that their interests and well-being were well protected if elected governor. Earlier, the Chairman of the Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers and Onisan of Isan-Ekiti, Oba Gabriel Ayodele Adejuwon, described Oyebanji as a thoroughbred and homegrown Ekiti man with a lot of experiences garnered within and outside government which were needed to govern Ekiti.
