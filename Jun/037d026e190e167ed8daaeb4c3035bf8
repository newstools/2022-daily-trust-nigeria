He said the ruling party is “unfair and unjust” to Tinubu. Sani said this in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday.

He explained that he witnessed several meetings when Asiwaju frequented Kaduna to meet with Buhari. The post reads: “The APC is unfair and unjust to Asiwaju. Allah made Buhari president but Asiwaju played a pivotal role. I have been in some meetings when Asiwaju frequented Kaduna. “Unfortunately, people like us have left the party, we could have lent him our unwavering support. I would never have sat on the fence or kept quiet. But the truth is evident; they don’t like Asiwaju. Let him join the Atiku train,” he said. It could be recalled that Senator Sani left the ruling party before the 2019 general election due to a rift between him and Governor Nasir El-Rifai.
