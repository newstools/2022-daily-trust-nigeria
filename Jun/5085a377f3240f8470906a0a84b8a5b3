The Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) has directed network providers in Nasarawa State to ease the difficulty being faced by People Living with Disability (PLD) in registering their Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs). Speaking at the inclusiveness of Persons with Disabilities awareness and engagement programme in Lafia yesterday, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, said the commission seeks policies and regulatory guidelines that would address the concerns of the physically challenged regarding ICT accessibility. Pantami was represented by the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Mr Umar Danbatta, said the full spectrum of ICT requires everyone to have equal opportunities for participation in everyday socio-economic life in the digital economy which is the basis for the inclusion of a forum for People Living with Disabilities. The state chairman of the Nigeria Association of the Blinds, Mr Shugaba Oloshu, explained that the PLDs have been facing some challenges and difficulties in capturing, adding that sometimes they have to look for relatives that would stand for them before they could register their SIMs.
