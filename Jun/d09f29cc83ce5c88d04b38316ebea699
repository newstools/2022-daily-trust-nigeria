Ahead of the 2023 election, aspirants into various public offices have been urged to respect the tax policy review that required them to show their tax payments before running for political positions. The President, the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Mr. Adesina Adedayo stated this while fielding questions from newsmen after the institute’s 29th Annual General Meeting held in Lagos on Wednesday. Adedayo stressed that before public resources would be entrusted to anyone, it would be pertinent for such a person to show a sign of responsibility by being tax compliant. He said, “It is actually not a new thing, we had it far back around our tax policy review level where we made it clear that the only important thing is that if you want to manage people and resources, let’s see what you are contributing.
