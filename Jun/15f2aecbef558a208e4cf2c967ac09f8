Akinrogun Yusuf, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and head of the media office of the party’s presidential candidate in the 2023 general election, Atiku Abubakar, has said the governorship election in Ekiti State will be a tight contest. The Governorship election in Ekiti is slated for 18th June 2022. Yusuf, who was speaking on the Trust Tv programme, Daily Politics, on Friday night said there might likely be a rerun at the end of Saturday’s poll. He said with Segun Oni, a former governor of the state, flying the flag of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), it is now a three-horse race. Abiodun Abayomi is the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) while Olabisi Kolawole Kolapo is running on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said: “It’s a three-horse race in that place [Ekiti] now so to say with Engineer Oni on the ballot for SDP, with the PDP and APC. “The good news is that INEC is doing its best, we have seen the show of strength by the security and with the electoral law and use of the electronic transmission and the rest of it, nobody is going to have a lot of cannel voting where you get millions of votes. “I’m not expecting any party to have so much votes. There might not even be a clear winner at the first instance because it’s going to be very close. “Like INEC was saying, everybody is going to see it. There is a portal and as you are voting the result will be counting both in Ekiti and Abuja and on the net.” Yusuf said there  might be voter apathy following the recent attack of worshippers in Owo, Ondo State where at least 40 people were killed. He said many people may be scared to be anywhere there is a large gathering for now. He, however, expressed optimism that the people of the state would make the right choice at the end of the day and vote for the PDP’s candidate as their new governor.
