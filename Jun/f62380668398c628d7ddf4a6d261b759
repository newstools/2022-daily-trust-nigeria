Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, has said he has no deal with the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of this Saturday’s governorship poll in Ekiti State. There are claims that Oni has reached a pact with Tinubu so that he would step down and pave the way for the All Progressives Congress (APC) to retain power in the state. Presidency: I’ll run again, says Yahaya Bello Bad governance persists due to voter apathy – ADC presidential candidate But addressing newsmen in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, Oni said he has not signed any deal with Tinubu to shelve his governorship ambition. “Let me say that this is a lie; I have not seen Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for over a year now. I am here for Ekiti people and I will not compromise the interest of Ekiti people for anything,” he said.
