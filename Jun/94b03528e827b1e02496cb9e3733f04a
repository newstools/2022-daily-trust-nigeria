The Tinubu Vanguard, a support group of the former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, has pledged that all those who supported his emergence as the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate would not be abandoned. The director-general of the organisation, Dr Johnny Benjamin, said yesterday in Abuja that the northern state governors and other stakeholders would always be carried along during Tinubu campaigns and after he may have been voted by Nigerians in 2023. He said: “The clear and overwhelming victory of Asiwaju Tinubu at the Eagle Square, Abuja, is well deserved and a very clear indication of the love and trust of the people, particularly the rank and file of the APC, believing in his ability and capacity to lead the party to victory, which he has worked for, all through a better part of his life. “Asiwaju’s emergence as the standard bearer is assured victory for the APC at the general elections in 2023.”
