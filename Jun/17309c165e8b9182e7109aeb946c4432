Natives of the FCT under the auspices of the Abuja Original Inhabitant Youths Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEO) have launched a network platform. Speaking at the launching in Abuja on Saturday, the Executive Director of AOIYEO, Commandant Isaac David, said the FCT Youth Yetwork was launched in order to bridge the gap between the government and the people of the FCT. David said the network was in line with their objective to build bridges between the people at the grassroots and those in urban communities across the six area councils of the territory. According to him, the FCT Youth Network will be the most extensive grassroots network in Abuja, saying his organisation had done lots of research on community-building projects and had decided to formalise them. Also speaking, the Senior Special Adviser on Community Development to the AMAC Chairman,  Comrade Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf,  said the FCT Youth Network was a platform meant to unite FCT youths to speak in with voice. He said, “This platform is to ensure good governance at all levels for the people of the FCT: residents and indigenous people.”
