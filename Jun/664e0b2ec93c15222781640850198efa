However, firemen are often at the receiving end; incurring the wrath of mobs whenever fire wreaks havoc, with the mobs claiming “slow response” on the part of the firemen. A resident, Madam Bintu Adelakun, who witnessed a fire incident at Oke-Popo in Osogbo, said firemen came to the scene immediately they were called but that they went back to get water. She said, “Before they brought the water the fire had consumed property worth millions of naira.” Another resident, Hon Adeoye Adelakun, while speaking on the effort of firefighters, lauded them for ensuring that fires did not spread to other buildings. Mr Segun Adegoke, a journalist who shared his experience, said the attitude of people trying to take pictures and record videos during fire incidents could constitute hindrance to firemen while carrying out their duty. The Director, Osun State Fire Service, Mr Michael Ogundipe, urged residents to call the service immediately a fire breaks out and assured that firemen were always ready to do their job. He said, “People will not call us on time when there is fire incident. They will call when it is beyond their control. When we get there, they will blame us for not coming on time. This may lead to mob attack on our men and equipment. People should call the fire service on time when there is fire incident.”
