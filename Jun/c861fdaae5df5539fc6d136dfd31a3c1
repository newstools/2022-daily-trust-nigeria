Some party officials were seen fighting over money disbursed to be shared with voters in the Ikole Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondents who were on the ground said vote-buying was going on in some of the polling units. They also reported that some Action Democratic Party (ADP), officials were lamenting that money meant to be shared in their polling unit was not disbursed. At PU 011 Anglican Primary School, Ward 10 Oke Ayedun, Ikole Local Government Area, officials of ADP were quarrelling over money that was disbursed to be shared with voters. The woman in the video said they were supposed to share N50,000 with voters in that polling unit but got nothing yet while a nearby polling unit was given N40,000 to share with voters. Our correspondents also captured on camera an agent of one of the leading political parties bringing money to a polling unit.
