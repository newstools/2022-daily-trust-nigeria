Shareholders of NASCON Allied Industries Plc, a subsidiary of Dangote Industries Limited (DIL), have commended the food seasoning company over its impressive performance in the year ended December 31, 2021, despite the harsh economic operating environment as the company emerged the best haulage company of the year. Speaking during NASCON’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) held at the weekend in Lagos, a representative of the shareholders, Mrs Bisi Bakare, said the performance reflected the ability of the management of NASCON to steer the company through difficult times, especially in the face of lack of power, fluctuating exchange regime and dwindling purchasing power of consumers. She expressed the belief that the overall performance of the company was a reflection of its seven sustainability pillars adopted by NASCON and which were geared towards ensuring that the company connected with all stakeholders. Another shareholder, Mrs Adetutu Siyanbola, said the NASCON Transport Team section should be commended as indicated in the financial report for winning the best haulage company of the year out of the 684 companies that enrolled for the Road-Transport-Safety-Standardisation-Scheme of the Federal Road Safety Corps. In her remarks, the Group Executive Director, Commercial of the company, Hajiya Fatima Aliko Dangote, said the company used the period of the downturn occasioned by the pandemic to lay a solid ground for the company with the construction of the state-of-the-art salt processing factory at Apapa, and that going forward the company would begin to reap the reward which ultimately would translate to higher dividends for the shareholders.
