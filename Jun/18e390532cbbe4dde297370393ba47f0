President and Chairman of Council, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), Prof. Benjamin Osisioma, has said members are deliberately being equipped with requisite knowledge to excel anywhere in the world. He disclosed this during the opening ceremony of the 3rd Session of the 2022 Mandatory Continuing Professional Development (MCPD) programme in Jos on Tuesday. Prof. Osisioma said the training is aimed at equipping members with knowledge of the current accounting system globally for both domestic and international opportunities for Nigerian accountants. The ANAN president charged participants on completing the training by giving the desired commitment to benefit from the new knowledge and skills. He also commended the Plateau State government for supporting the hosting of the event and appealed for the completion of a road project leading to the ANAN University as well as the protection of the school, students and host communities from the activities of bandits. Governor Simon Lalong of the state, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Danladi Atu, commended ANAN for securing accreditation from the National Universities Commission (NUC) to operate the ANAN University. He also appealed for the inclusion of more Plateau people in the executive team of ANAN. The Plateau State Branch Chairman of ANAN, Hon. Andy Udah, stressed that Lalong deserved to be honoured by the body as the friendliest governor in recent times.
