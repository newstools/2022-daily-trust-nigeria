The Risk Management Association of Nigeria (RIMAN) has announced plans to hold its 21st Annual International Conference and Annual General Meeting (AGM). In a statement yesterday, RIMAN said the event slated for June 23 to 24, would be held at the Grand Ballroom of Eko Hotels and Suites, Lagos. It stated that the conference would be the largest gathering of risk practitioners and stakeholders in the country, and that it was going to be invaluable for the enlightening and upskilling of risk practitioners over the years as it offered unique opportunities for capacity building, knowledge sharing and networking. In a statement, RIMAN said, “The theme for this year’s conference is ‘Sustainability and Enterprise Risk Management: 2022 and Beyond’. This is because executives have realised that more robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) frameworks are required to remain competitive in this new era. “Risk leaders, in turn, are looking beyond the reactive measures organizations usually deploy in handling unexpected incidents such as the pandemic, to having more proactive and effective risk mitigation strategies, which can be a competitive differentiator for their companies.” It stated further that as the scourge of COVID-19 abated, more businesses were returning to near normal operations and looking to more sustainable ways of doing business. It said, “It is therefore crucial for businesses to examine their approach to sustainability and elevate their understanding of resulting risk exposures.”
