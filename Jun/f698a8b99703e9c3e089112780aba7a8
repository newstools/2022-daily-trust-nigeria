Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said that the emergence of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will determine the action the APC will take in a few hours to come. Sule disclosed this while answering questions from journalists at the venue of the party’s presidential primary on Tuesday. Arrangements have gone far for the APC to conduct its presidential primary at the Eagles Square. The governor noted that the PDP has produced a strong candidate known to everybody all over the world. Sule said, “We have to produce someone who can match Atiku and beat him. Any decision less than this, we, as a party, are in trouble. “So any decision we take will be determined by this factor.”
