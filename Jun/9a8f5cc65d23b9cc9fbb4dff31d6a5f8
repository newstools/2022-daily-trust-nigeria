Work on section II of the ongoing dualization of Suleja-Minna road and construction of the Agaie-Baro road will be completed by January and May 2023 respectively, said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing. Daily Trust reports that both roads are being funded by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) under the Tax Credit Scheme introduced by the federal government. NNPC had in 2021 provided funds for the construction of 21 roads in the country to aid the movement of trucks to supply petroleum products to all parts of the country. But in a press statement, the Director Highways Construction and Rehabilitation in the ministry, Engr. Folorunsho Esan, said work on the Suleja-Minna road is impressive with the contractor on site making progress on various aspects of work. He noted that the only challenge on the road is that of security but that is being taken care of with the presence of security agents. The director said the road, when completed, would boost the economy and that of the North Central region in particular as it leads to the Baro Port through which goods and services can be brought into the country and exported. The Team Leader of NNPC, Tahir Ahmed, said the company is funding the construction of the roads because of their importance to the economy of the nation through which petroleum products are being conveyed to other parts of the country. He reiterated that the Tax Credit Scheme has allowed corporate organisations to invest the tax that would have been paid to the federal government into infrastructure development.
