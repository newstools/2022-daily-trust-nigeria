The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said the 2023 elections will be a referendum on the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration’s scorecard. Atiku said it was disturbing that when the rest of the world was in a sober mood on account of the massacre in Owo, Ondo State, the ruling party could not find the moral rectitude to cancel a dinner with their presidential aspirants. In a statement, Atiku’s spokesperson, Paul Ibe, said with the blood of innocent worshippers flowing on the street of Ondo State, leaders of the APC were gathered in Abuja, treating themselves to a dinner in a manner that suggested lack of empathy to the mood of the nation. He said, “It is important to ask the managers of the ruling party why they slated the so-called convention on a working day, thereby disrupting economic activities around the Federal Capital Territory. “Even as delegates in the so-called election entered into the Federal Capital Territory, they must have been greeted with long queues of vehicles waiting to buy fuel and darkness that continues to grim the capital city on account of seizures in electricity supply. “Should the APC delegates ask themselves what they have been brought to Abuja for, they should know that the primary of their party is not about any of the individuals vying for the presidential ticket of their party, but a referendum on the APC’s scorecard in the past seven years.”
