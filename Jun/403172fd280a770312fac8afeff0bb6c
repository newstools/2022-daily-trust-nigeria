A commercial motorcyclist, Mr Adegoke Adejare, on Monday, donated writing materials worth thousands of naira to pupils of St Paul’s Anglican School, Yanbule, Ibadan, Oyo State. Adejare, who charged the beneficiaries to always read their books, urged them to use the materials he donated to enhance their studies, noting that it was his little effort in encouraging those who might be in need. The “bike man”, also nicknamed “One Nigeria”, urged Nigerians to collaborate with government in the development of the education sector. He said, “I donated books, pencils, pens and erasers. This is what I like to do. I never had the opportunity to attend a formal school, so I have vowed to do my best to support the government in developing the education sector through little gestures such as this.” Mrs Oluwatoyin Gbaroye, the headmistress of the school, said One Nigeria’s gesture would encourage the pupils to take their studies seriously. She thanked the donor on behalf of the management and teachers of the school and assured that the books would be put to good use. Similarly, Dr Nureni Adeniran the Executive Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, commended One Nigeria’s philanthropic act, while thanking him for his consideration to complement government’s effort.
