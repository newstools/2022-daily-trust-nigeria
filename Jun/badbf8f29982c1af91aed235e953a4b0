Hamagam, Birnin Kebbi The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has announced the result of its presidential primary election held on Sunday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja with  Kola Abiola emerging  the winner. The National  Chairman of the PRP, Dr. Falau Bello, said  Abiola won landslide having polled  2097 to defeat his closest challenger, Alhaji Usman Bugaje who scored 813. Patience Ndidi and  Gboluga Mosugu trailed the duo with 329 and 263 votes respectively. The results were collated from the states where delegates voted and transmitted to Abuja where a final collation at the party’s Secretariat in Abuja last night showed that 3522 delegates were accredited with 3416 valid votes recorded while 141 were invalid. Earlier in his remarks, Bello said the party did its primaries differently because it wanted to take the process nearer to the people. Kola is the son of Chief Moshood Abiola, the late philanthropist and the presumed winner of the 1993 presidential election which was annulled by the President Ibrahim Babangida military junta. The older Abiola contested on the platform of Social Democratic Party (SDP). Meanwhile,  Salihu Tanko Yakasai has emerged as the flag bearer and winner of the just concluded governorship primary elections conducted by the PRP in Kano. Similarly, a former Head of Service (HoS) of Kebbi State, Abubakar Udu Idris, has emerged as the PRP governorship candidate in Kebbi State. Also, an Islamic cleric and business mogul Sheikh Ahmed Umar Tijjani has won the Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone ticket on the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP).
