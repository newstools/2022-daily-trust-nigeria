A Federal High Court in Lagos has approved the purchase of all the minority shares of Venus Construction Company Ltd in Oando PLC as the energy firm reports N132 billion net loss. According to its filing on the NGX, the approval was part of the outcomes of the petition filed by 14 shareholders, holding 299,257,869 shares in Oando. In the disclosure signed by the Company Secretary, Ayotola Jagun, Venus had approached the court on March 25, 2021 for the shares buyout either by Ocean and Oil Development Partners Limited, OODP or Oando. The court ordered Oando PLC to convene within 120 days a meeting of shareholders to consider, and approve for the Oando shares purchases; Oando told NGX it will take a step in one month for that. “Today, OODP has a shareholding of 57.37% in Oando PLC and the above-mentioned minority shareholders 42.63% shareholding. This action precipitated by the petition from certain Oando minority shareholders, if approved by all the minority shareholders at the court-ordered meeting will result in a voluntary delisting of the Company’s shareholding on the NGX,” it noted. Meanwhile, its unaudited results for the four quarters of 2020 reported Loss-After-Tax of N132.6bn compared to N207.1bn in 2019; it recorded 15% turnover decrease which was N490bn compared to N576.6bn in 2019.
