Ahead of next year’s general elections, Mazi Okwudili Nwa-Anyajike has emerged as the presidential candidate of National Rescue Mission (NRM). Nwa-Anyajike, a businessman, polled 180 votes to defeat his closest rival, Prof. Benedicta Egbo, who scored 30 votes at the party’s special convention, on Thursday in Abuja. Also, Senator Ibrahim Yinusa scored 10, while six other aspirants withdrew from the contest shortly before the 300 delegates commenced voting. In his acceptance speech, Nwa-Anyajike promised to unite the country and provide infrastructural development if elected president of Nigeria. Earlier, NRM national chairman, Ambassador Isaac Chigozie Udeh, said the party made it mandatory that a presidential candidate must be between the age of 35 and 55. He said, “National Rescue Movement is poised to rescue Nigerians and our country from the stagnant state we have found ourselves in today.”
