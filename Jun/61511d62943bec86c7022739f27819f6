The Chief Technical Officer of AEDC, Kassim Abdullahi Burkullu, said the substation will reduce the load burden of electricity distribution in Bida and its environs. “With the coming of the substation, it will reduce the load from the 33kv feeder and supply to customers,” he said. “Bida had only one substation supplying six 11kv feeders, but with the newly commissioned 33kv substation, most of the 11kV feeders would be relieved,” he stated. He then urged the community members to desist from vandalism as the company incurred millions in the repair and replacement of vandalised equipment. Also speaking, the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, charged the community members not to vandalise the facility as it will serve their own good. Represented by Alhaji Yahaya Madaki, the royal father commended AEDC for their efforts in ensuring power supply in Bida, while calling on the DisCo to do more in improving service delivery.
