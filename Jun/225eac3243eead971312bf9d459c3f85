The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has expressed worry over the gale of defections in the party. Seven senators dumped APC for other opposition parties after they failed to secure the governing party’s ticket to contest the 2023 elections. Reps move to broaden capital market coverage FG to address high cost of doing business at seaports Members of the Senate who have defected from the APC are Ibrahim Shekarau (Kano), Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi), Adamu Aliero (Kebbi), Halliru Jika (Bauchi), Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina), Lawal Yahaya Gumau (Bauchi), and Francis Alimikhena (Edo). Briefing reporters after a closed-door meeting with APC senators, Adamu said it was unfortunate that the lawmakers left the party. He said the defections were expected due to the electioneering season when the country usually witnesses all manner of things. He said: “In every election year, these kinds of sub-steps give cause for people; stakeholders to sneeze. Nigeria is not an exception and the APC is not an exception. “So, I don’t give a damn what is happening in other parties; I care about what is happening in our party. “You know it is not just in APC that this thing is happening. Because we are the ruling party, our problems are more prominent in the public glare. “No responsible leader would not worry about losing one member; not to talk of two or three. “At the moment, we are faced with the stark reality of their problems but we are committed with my colleagues in the National Working Committee to face the problems squarely and solve them by the grace of God.” The minority parties in the Senate are presently five in number as of yesterday. They are: the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Young People’s Party (YPP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), and Labour Party (LP).
