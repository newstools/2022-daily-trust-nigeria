…It was a robbery – Police Residents of Jenew Homes Estate in Karsana District of Abuja have dispelled the rumour of a kidnapping attack in the area, which shares boundary with the Gwarimpa Housing Estate. There were reports of a gunmen attack in the estate on social media and other online platforms in the early hours of Monday, claiming the abduction of a number of residents. City & Crime visited the estate on Monday morning and the residents spoken to dispelled the story; describing it as fake news. A resident, Johnson Wabara, said there was no incident of such nature in the area, and even around the neighbouring areas. He said, “Journalists have since morning been visiting us over the reported incident. “I happen to be one of the directors here, and we have received a lot of calls from our associates on the rumour. “We have since issued a warning to two media outlets, Sahara Reporters and one Union News. I personally called them on phone and they apologised. “But we have demanded them to debunk it in a publication in at least one of the national dailies within 48 hours as they have caused us a lot of damage. Anything short of that would lead to court case against them.” Reacting to the report, the spokesperson of the police in the FCT, DSP Josephine Adeh, confirmed that criminals invaded the estate located at Kasana, Galadima area, but that men of the command in Galadima Division repelled the criminals. She said, ‘’The command wishes to set the records straight, that on June 6, 2022, a distress call was received from Queens Efab Estate, Kasana, Galadima area, that there was an ongoing armed robbery operation. ‘’Operatives of the command attached to Galadima Division swiftly responded and upon arrival at the estate, the robbers took to their heels. ‘’The gallant operatives, however, gave them a chase which led to them abandoning some items they had already stolen, including phones and laptops.’’
