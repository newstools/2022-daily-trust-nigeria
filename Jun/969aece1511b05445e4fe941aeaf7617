Hours to the commencement of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary, Secretary of the defuct Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe has dumped the party. Akpanudoedehe in a letter addressed to his ward chairman sighted by our correspondent on Monday said his decision to dump the APC was a tough one, but that his supporters and political allies had prevailed on him to do so. The APC former spokesperson is at daggers drawn with former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, in Akwa Ibom State over the control of party structure in the state. This led to the factionalisation of the party in the state. But the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) recognised the executives produced by the Akpabio-led faction during the state congress last year.
