From the paper size posters to inflated balloons hung in the middle of the road as well as others flying on a predetermined trajectory, all the aspirants seek acceptance to emerge the flag bearer of the party. The towering posters compete for attention of passers-by and their efficacy can be felt as onlookers take a long gaze.
