Motorists plying the ever-busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway are expected to experience slow vehicular movement as the federal government intensifies rehabilitation works. The Lagos State Government (LASG) announcing this yesterday said there will be a diversion around kilometre zero to five near Lagos, lasting for six months. The federal government, through the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, has a target of December 2022 for the completion of the 127.6-kilometre-long road project being handled by Julius Berger and RCC. While Julius Berger is handling the Lagos-Shagamu axis, the RCC is in charge of the Shagamu-Ibadan section of the expressway. The road is one of the critical highways in Nigeria being the major connecting route for the nation’s seaport with the hinterland. Thousands of cargo and petroleum trucks as well as passenger vehicles ply this route daily. Ahead of the diversion, the Lagos State Government has rolled out traffic diversion plans as the rehabilitation work on the identified axis begins on 9th of June, 2022 while the diversion would last for a duration of six months. According to the rehabilitation schedule contained in the notification, kilometre zero to five of the Lagos/Shagamu Expressway will be modified for traffic diversion. He assured that the other lanes on the expressway will be accessible to motorists during the course of the construction. Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, affirmed that signage and diversion signs will be installed along the route to guide motorists on movement and to ensure safety, adding that the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority will be on ground to control traffic flow. The transport commissioner called for patience and understanding as the construction is geared towards a better transportation system and improved economic activity.
