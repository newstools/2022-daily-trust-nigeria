Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a non-governmental organisation, Pray Nigeria Movement (PNM), has urged Nigerians to begin a seven-day fast to seek God’s face for peaceful elections. The convener, Prophet Isaiah Wealth, who disclosed this during a press briefing in Lagos at the weekend, stated that the country is in dire need of God’s intervention as it approaches the election year. 3 hunters arrested over kidnapping in Adamawa Kano opens database for sex offenders He said, “Nigeria has long had a promise from God that our nation will be great again. Sadly, things seem to be deteriorating and are on a perpetual decline into anarchy and disintegration.” The prophet, who was represented by the group’s public relations officer, Apostle Abrich Agbi, added that whoever becomes the next president in 2023 would determine the progress of the country, hence the need for the fast tagged “June 12.” He added, “Though we believe in politics and democracy as the drivers of development, the Pray Nigeria Movement seeks to deliver its own quota to Nigeria’s development by leveraging on our connection to God in prayer, hearing from Him and delivering encouraging messages of direction from above, which would help propel the hearts of those with genuine intentions for the nation.”
