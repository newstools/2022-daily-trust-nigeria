More than 50 communities in Ogun State have been thrown into darkness following a snap on the Ota-industrial 33KV feeder. Our correspondent gathered that the snap on the feeder was as a result of an explosion which affected several transformers including those at Ilaro and Papalanto. The Ogun region of the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) confirmed the development in a statement on Thursday. According to the IBEDC, many towns and villages in Ewekoro, Ifo, Yewa South and Ipokia Local Government Areas are in darkness.
