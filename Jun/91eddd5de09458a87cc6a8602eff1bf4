While reiterating that Gombe APC is one united family, the governor warned that a divided party cannot win an election that will give them the opportunity to continue with the people-oriented projects being executed by his administration. He promised that as leader of the APC in the state, he will implement all the possible suggestions and recommendations, to be submitted by the committee at the end of the exercise. Responding, Dr Jatau commended Governor Yahaya for constituting the committee, which he described as apt, “considering grievances that arose from the recently conducted primaries.” In Nasarawa State, the party also set up reconciliation committee to reconcile aggrieved members of the party. Speaking during the inauguration of the committee, Governor Sule said some aggrieved members of the party have left APC due to what they described as injustice in the party. The governor, however, urged the chairman of the party’s reconciliation committee in the state, headed by a senior legal luminary, Barrister Hassan Muhammad Liman, SAN, and members of the reconciliation committee to do all they could to ensure that the aggrieved members who have left and those yet to leave returned and remain in the party, as according to him, there is no alternative to APC.”  From Haruna Gimba Yaya (Gombe) & Umar Muhammed (Lafia)
