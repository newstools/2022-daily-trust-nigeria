The federal government has attributed the delay in implementing the $3.2 billion contract for ‘complete’ automation of the Nigerian Custom Service (NCS), to disagreements between the consortium partners for the project. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) had approved the project in 2020 but the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, who addressed reporters yesterday after a FEC meeting led by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, said the implementation would now begin as the party in the dispute had opted out despite mediation efforts by the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation. Customs, this week, signed a new pact with the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China’s Huawei Technologies Ltd on the project. She said, “So, the partner that signed was already in the initial concession. So, one party did not agree with the terms that were signed. And there is a new agreement that had been signed and that partner was reported to have opted out of the concession. The NCS Comptroller-General, retired Col. Hameed Ali, who signed the new contract, had explained that the NCS will generate $176 billion (N73 trillion) over the next 20 years through the implementation of the e-Customs project.
