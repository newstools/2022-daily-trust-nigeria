The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said they did not adopt Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as the consensus candidate for the 2023 poll. There were reports on Monday that the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu and the NWC members had adopted Lawan as the party’s consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential poll. But addressing a press conference on Monday evening at the APC headquarters in Abuja, the party’s National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Argungu who was flanked by other members of the NWC said the reports were fake and baseless. Argungu said the governors from the North and South have all agreed that there should be a power shift to the South, adding that the NWC cannot do otherwise. Our correspondent reports that the APC is working hard to produce a consensus presidential candidate for the 2023 poll. The party’s special convention where 2, 340 delegates would elect the party’s candidate is slated for tomorrow.
