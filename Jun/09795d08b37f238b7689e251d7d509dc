TAJBank Limited on Wednesday highlighted indices to ensure its continuous and sustainable growth in the years ahead as it eyes a national bank licence. The Managing Director/CEO of the bank, Mr Hamid Joda, in his report at the bank’s 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in Abuja Wednesday attributed the performances of the non-interest lender over the past two years to innovativeness in key areas of customer-centric service delivery powered by world-class technologies and solutions, human resource capacity building and shareholders and customers’ growing confidence. He said the bank is focused on securing a national bank licence by the second quarter this year, and promoting financial inclusion, among others. Joda also spoke of plans to grow the bank’s agency network to 100,000 agents by 2025 thereby reducing the financial exclusion rate; and to transform TAJBank into a leading digital bank in the country before the end of this year. “We are constantly improving our operations so that we can respond to our clients’ ever-changing needs in their daily lives more efficiently and effectively. We are also pushing ourselves further beyond our comfort zones to provide a viable financial platform for all our stakeholders”, Joda said. The bank’s Chairman, Alhaji Tanko Gwamma, said the bank retained more customers, and recorded exponential growth in its risk asset base. “I am delighted to inform you that the future of the bank is outstandingly bright and beautiful.”
