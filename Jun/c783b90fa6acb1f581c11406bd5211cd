An Information Technology and Telecommunications firm, Let’s Talk, is set to launch Nigeria’s first instant messaging application, ‘Let’s Talk’ before September ends. The Chief Operating Officer of the company, Ms Folashade Ayeni, explained that the application which has been designed by a team of Nigerian software engineers was in line with the vision of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to promote indigenous participation in the social media space. She said “If you recall, on October 4, 2021; WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram crashed, and no one was able to use those applications. “So, we thought about owning our social media platform; where Nigerians can have guaranteed communications, with utmost security, which is Nigerian-owned and indigenous to us and for us in Africa,” Ayeni said. She noted that the company seeks to collaborate with NITDA, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and other relevant agencies to ensure the success of the application and acceptability by Nigerians.
