 The Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars in Nigeria (CYMSN) has commended the 11 APC governors from the northern region over their resolution to zone the party’s presidential candidate ticket to the southern region. The organisation’s President General, Sheikh Abdur Rasheed Mayaleke; Secretary General, Prof. Olaiya Abideen and Publicity Secretary, Barrister AbdulGaniyu Olaide Ezra, on Sunday in a statement said that the affected governors deserved commendation as their stance was in line with the agreement of the founding fathers of the party. They said that they have been calling for the candidature of a Muslim from the South West for sometime and that they see the present zoning decision as a step in the right direction. “It is on record that a Muslim from the South West have for long been disenfranchised from Presidency on account of their religion and we would not like this to be repeated this time around. “We are greatly indebted to President Muhammadu Buhari, who created enabling environment for the resolution of the logjam. “We acknowledge this courageous stance for equity and moral rectitude. We applaud the zeal and determination of all the stakeholders to engage realistically and honestly. We salute this uncommon resolve to confront issues militating against the march towards nationhood and ultimate greatness. “All the stakeholders that intervened at one point or the other behind the scene are well appreciated,” they said.
