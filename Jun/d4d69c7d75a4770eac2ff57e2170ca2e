The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has promised to conduct a credible governorship election in Ekiti State on June 18. INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, who stated this yesterday in Ado-Ekiti at a special interface with the state’s council of traditional rulers, urged the electorate to be peaceful in their conduct.

The INEC boss revealed that the commission would conduct two elections in the state, the governorship election and the suspended House of Assembly bye-election in Ekiti East Constituency 1. The Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, tasked INEC on the need to tackle the excessive monetisation of the electoral process. He said, “Our system must grow to allow those who are young but competent. But with the way things are going, I see that only the moneybags will be having their way.”
