The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the conduct of credible elections in 2023. In a statement signed by the House Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, to commemorate this year’s Democracy Day, the caucus stated that the federal government must use the occasion to commit to processes that would check electoral manipulations, guarantee the security of voters and ensure that only votes cast by Nigerians in their respective polling units counted. They said in the statement: “Our caucus holds that the hallmark of democracy is the ability of the people to freely choose their leaders under an unrestricted, fair and transparent process that guarantees that their expressed will at the ballot for a truly democratic and people-oriented government is not subverted. “The minority caucus is indeed saddened that under the APC government, the tenets of democracy; its principles of adherence to rule of law, justice, equity, freedom, transparency in governance and national unity, which Chief MKO Abiola died for, have all been trampled underfoot by dictatorial and anti-democratic proclivities. “The minority caucus, however, urges Nigerians not to despair but remain resolute in the collective determination to entrench the tenets of democracy in our country by fully participating in the current electoral process.”
