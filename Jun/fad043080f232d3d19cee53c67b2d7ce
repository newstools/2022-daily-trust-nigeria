A former governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni, Wednesday, described as “mere speculation” reports that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, would join the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He spoke on Wednesday while responding to questions from newsmen in Abuja after inaugurating the SDP sub-convention committee. There were insinuations that Tinubu may dump APC in the event that he failed to secure its presidential ticket. But a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, said the former Lagos State governor would support whoever emerges as the party’s presidential candidate if the process is free and fair. Lawal, who spoke after submitting Tinubu’s nomination forms to the party’s officials in Abuja, said the APC national leader was 100 per cent prepared for the primary. Oni said SDP remained open to people who share its vision and mission, and people who were ready to deepen democracy and good governance. He said: “Too many speculations! Let me say that we are Social Democratic Party. As far as we are concerned our doors are open to everybody. We are not locking opportunities here. We will wait. “Every process will be taken seriously and without any preference. So, do not speculate too far. We are going to have our convention.”
