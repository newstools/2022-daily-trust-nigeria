The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Kaduna State, Alhaji Isah Mohammed Ashiru, has vowed to reverse some of the policies of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state if elected governor in 2023. He revealed this yesterday in a statement signed by Yakubu Lere El-Saed, the Director, Public Affairs, Isa Ashiru Campaign organisation. Ashiru sympathised with the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) in the state over the sacking of over 2,000 of its members by the state government, saying he would reverse some of the educational policies introduced by the APC-led government if given the mandate. The statement reads in part: “The campaign organisation challenges the state APC gubernatorial candidate, Senator Uba Sani, to make his position clear on the recent sacking of over 2,000 teachers and the planned demolition of Gwari Market, Rigasa, as well as the demolished market Saminaka in LGA.”
