Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, said his decision to step down for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was aimed at strengthening democracy in Nigeria. Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku Abubakar minutes to the commencement of voting during the just concluded PDP presidential primary and asked his supporters to vote for the latter. The governor disclosed this while addressing his supporters on Friday at Sokoto Government House. He said he was taught by his leaders to make sacrifice for others, especially for the good of the country, calling on Nigerians to vote for the PDP. Tambuwal said, “What we have done is for the good of our party and the country. I appreciate everyone of you that prayed for me and our party. The sacrifice that I have made on your behalf is aimed at strengthening our party, our democracy, and; by the grace of God, soft landing our polity. “This is in consonance with the teachings of our leaders and the [emulation] of the examples they have given to us in the past: that we must continue to make sacrifice for the good of all of us and our country. “I thank the people of Sokoto State and all my supporters across the country for their support. Rest assured, we shall work assiduously for the victory of our party come 2023 General Elections.”
