A member of vigilante group, who preferred anonymity, told our reporter through telephone on Tuesday that the vigilantes from Debogi, Zago and Ebbo communities on Monday engaged the bandits in a gun battle.

He said, “The killing of one of the vigilante commanders who is from Debogi village in Niger State, alongside five others in an ambush by bandits last week, prompted us to mobilise to the forest on Monday.” Daily Trust had reported that six vigilantes were killed by bandits in an ambush last Friday while they were trying to rescue 22 Abuja farmers that were abducted in Rafin-Daji community in Abaji Area Council of the FCT. The spokesman of the police, command ASP Wasiu Abiodun, did not pick calls or reply to text message sent to him on the incident.
