The Kwara State government and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state have engaged in war of words over the performance of the present administration in the state. While PDP said the APC-led government has nothing to show after three years in office, the latter debunked the claim, saying the opposition party was only “frustrated by the giant strides of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq.” They spoke in separate statements, yesterday, on the performance of Governor Abdulrazaq within his three years in office. According to PDP, the governor has not lived up to the expectations of the people of the state. The state PDP chairman, Babatunde Mohammed, said the governor opted to read an “uninspiring speech” instead of commissioning projects to mark the Democracy Day celebration. “Since June 12 is Democracy Day, the people of Kwara State expected that the administration will roll out dividends of democracy by unfolding new projects and social services, which will enhance the socio-economic development of the state and improve the standard of living of the people,” he said. But the special adviser to the governor on political communication, Bashir Adigun, said the PDP is ”frustrated by the giant strides of the governor, having realised the difference between his administration and their corrupt regime is like darkness and daylight.” Adigun said the governor did not commission projects during the Democracy Day celebration because the administration was not into commissioning uncompleted projects. He accused PDP of commissioning deceptive projects like the Metropolitan Square, cargo terminal and Government House residence, when it was in power. Adigun said the APC administration has done a lot of developmental projects and would let the projects “speak for themselves.”
