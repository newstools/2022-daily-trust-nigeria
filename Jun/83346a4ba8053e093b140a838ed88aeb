For the umpteenth time, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has called on members of the party in Lagos to bury their differences ahead of the 2023 general election. He said only through unity of purpose that the party can dislodge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. He spoke at the empowerment programme for 500 youths sponsored by Tommy Ogungbe under his foundation, Imole Eko Foundation Empowerment. Atiku, represented by one of his aides, Adai Edwin, commended the sponsor for his commitment to youth development. It would be recalled that the former Vice-President during his meeting with delegates in Lagos prior to the conduct of the PDP convention, stressed the need for unity among warring members of the party. Atiku who was the chairman of the empowerment programme, said the good gesture initiated by Ogungbe, an aspirant for Lagos West Senatorial District, is one of the good qualities the PDP is known for. He said youth empowerment would be one of his cardinal programmes if elected as the president. The organiser of the event said he came up with the initiative because of the compassion he has for the masses, disclosing that he started the philanthropic gesture 20 years ago. The 500 graduates of the program were presented certificates for participating in the training and as well as working tools, which include cooking gas, sewing machines, dryers, grinding machine, popcorn machines and make-up boxes for cosmetics.
