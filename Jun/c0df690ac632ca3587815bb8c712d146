By Ahmed Ahmed A group under the aegis of North East All Progressive Congress Enlightenment Circle, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and other stakeholders of the party to pick the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), as running mate to the party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The Chairman of the group, Alhaji Misbahu Sani Bauchi, in a statement yesterday, said Malami was a loyal and committed APC member from the North and should be considered because of his track record and achievements in the administration of the APC. The statement reads in part: “Malami was actively involved in the formation of the APC in 2013 as the resource person to the manifesto drafting sub-committee of the inter joint party merger committee among the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). “In 2014, Abubakar contested for the governorship ticket of the APC in Kebbi State but stepped down during the party’s primary poll in favour of Atiku Bagudu because of loyalty to the party and the leaders.” He further if Malami was picked the entire Northern youths would campaign for the victory of the Tinubu/Malami ticket
