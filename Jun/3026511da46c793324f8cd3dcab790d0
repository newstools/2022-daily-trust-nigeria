There is disquiet in Imo State government house following the resignation of Dr Batos Nwadike, the Special Adviser on Political Affairs to Governor Hope Uzodimma. Nwadike is also demanding the sum of N77.2 million, which he said he spent while in office. Nwadike is an influential member of the Uzodimma administration. However, in a letter to the governor dated June 22, Nwadike said he resigned because his office was rendered redundant and not funded. He said for the period of 28 months in office, he spent N77.2 million on salaries of his staff and furnishing the apartment allocated to him. “It is with a mixture of nostalgia, pride and regret that I write to formally inform you of my resignation as your Special Adviser on Political Matters,” he said. He added that despite his dedication, he was excluded from the scheme of affairs. “I was repeatedly left in the dark and denied access to power in a government and vision I played an unwavering and consistent leading role in birthing from 2001 to 2020,” he added. The state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, confirmed Nwadike’s resignation. “The Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has accepted his resignation. He thanked him for his services and wished him well in his future endeavours,” Emelumba told Daily Trust.
