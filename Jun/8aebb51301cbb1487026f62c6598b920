Alhaji Ahmed Maiyaki, a former Director General, Media, Communication and Publicity to a former Governor of Kaduna State, Ramalan Yero, has tasked media owners and practitioners to hold those seeking political office accountable to the people. He explained that doing this would help in delivering good governance. Maiyaki made the call shortly after presenting an internet facility accompanied with a 12-month free subscription to the leadership of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kaduna chapter. He said journalists must remain ethically responsible in discharging their functions, with a call on media owners and NUJ leadership both at the state and national levels to checkmate the activities of quackery. According to him, the internet facility will bring the members together and make the union’s secretariat more active. He said, “I feel that this internet facility will aid the work of journalists who are the watchdog of the society. We should do our work to put government in check for good governance and provision of infrastructural development, education, health and development.”
