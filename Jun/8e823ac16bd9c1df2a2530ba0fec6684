Traders at the popular Wambai Market in Kano have lamented the absence of a good drainage system, which they say is exposing them to flooding and other associated hazards. A shop owner, Mallam Abdullahi, told Daily Trust that their shops and goods were in danger as the rains had started entering their shops. He said, “It was disheartening last week when it rained for the first time this season in Kano and most of our shops were flooded. “This was caused by nothing other than the blockage of drains which was caused by the recent building erect adjacent to our shops. “We anticipated it and told the concerned authorities. We hope the necessary measures would now be put in place to address the issue.” Another shop owner, who chose not to be named, said the recent flooding was caused by a construction ongoing in the area, accusing the contractor of failing to provide alternatives to the drains that were blocked due to the project. He said, “If you look at this place you will find out there were gutters that passed through. Now they have been blocked with sand.” He added that, “If new gutters were provided prior to this time, misfortunes like this will not happen. “I am saying this because I am one of the victims of the misfortune of last week.” Another trader, Muhammad Sani, also expressed concern on the matter, saying if care was not taken subsequent rains might cause more damage. He said, “We call on the market’s management, even though they know about it and we are hoping they will do what is expected in time to curtail future occurrence, to something fast.” Reacting to the development, the Chairman of the Wambai Market, Nasidi Inuwa (Mai Gwanjo), said while they were aware of the issue, the management had taken action and had also taken the matter to the appropriate authorities. He added that work towards resolving the issue had commenced and would soon be brought under control. From Salim Umar Ibrahim & Sadiq Adamu, Kano
