Renowned lawyer and Convener, Progressive Lawyers for Osinbajo, Dr Kayode Ajulo, has commended the resolution by ten Northern governors and other leaders elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, that the presidential ticket of the party be zoned to the South. Ajulo described the development as a step towards the realization of a Nigeria devoid of tribal, religious and cultural differences, where fairness and equity reign supreme. He said the gesture will engender a long-lasting social integration between the two regions. The Ex-National Secretary of the Labour Party, who disclosed this in a statement issued on Monday, added that history will be kind to all the leaders involved in the decision. “I sincerely salute the courage of the Northern Governors who deemed it fit to make this historic decision at this crucial time in our national polity in the interest of equity and fairness within the two regions of the country. This singular act will further reinforce the sovereignty of Nigeria,” he said. Ajulo also applauded APC leaders in the Southwest, especially the Chairman, Southern Nigeria Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu for their roles in ensuring that the region produced the next president. The civil lawyer, who also lauded the leadership roles played by revered southern leaders, like Chief Edwin Clark, Chief George Obiozor, Pa Rueben Fasoranti, Pa Ayo Adebanjo and other, in mediating on behalf of the people of the region, urged the aspirants of the APC from the South to unanimously support Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as the consensus candidate. He said Osinbajo as a candidate is an automatic win for the region in 2023.
