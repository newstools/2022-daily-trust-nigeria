The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics (SSANIP), yesterday, requested the federal government to as a matter of urgency devise new strategies to quash the daily growing audacity of terrorists, bandits and other gunmen so as to create a peaceful environment in the country. The sssociation, at the end of an emergency meeting of its executive council in Abuja, specifically condemned the killing of worshippers at a Catholic church in Owo, Ondo State, last Sunday, describing the incident as unprovoked, evil, shocking and unfortunate. In a communique jointly signed by Adebanjo Ogunsipe, its national president, and Hussaini Y. Gwandu, the national secretary, the association observed with serious concern the alarming growing rate of inflation in the country and the attendant consequences on the purchasing power of the average Nigerian. The communique reads in part: “The daily rising prices of foodstuff and other commodities is a source of great concern to the union. Council expressed fear that if the trend is not immediately checked, all efforts to check the growing crimes in the country would be overwhelmed.’’ The association also frowned at the evident disregard for the National Board for Technical Education’s (NBTE) directive on usurpation of non-teaching positions by the management of the Hassan Usman Katsina Polytechnic, Katsina State. The meeting, the communique added, reviewed the ultimatum issued to the federal government on April 1, 2022, on many lingering issues such as infractions on the implementation of the 2019 Polytechnic Act, revitalisation funds, new scheme of service, minimum wage arrears, challenges of state-owned institutions, payment of incomplete salaries, among others. The communique further reads: “Council notes the response of relevant authorities to its demands and resolved that the ultimatum should be extended, while the National Executive Council (NEC) of the association should continue to engage the authorities concerned and follow these up with meaningful engagements to resolve other pending issues.’’
