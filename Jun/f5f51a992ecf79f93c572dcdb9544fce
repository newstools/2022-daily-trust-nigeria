The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has condemned last Saturday’s governorship election in Ekiti State, describing it as a daylight robbery and slap on democracy. The IPAC national chairman, Engr. Yabagi Yusuf Sani, said this on Wednesday in Abuja. According to him, the council’s observation team witnessed a brazen act of vote-buying by agents of political parties while officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agents looked the other way.

He urged INEC to meticulously evaluate its performance in the Ekiti election with a view to improving it in the forthcoming Osun State governorship election.
