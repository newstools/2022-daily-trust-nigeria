Also, the oil industry uses a lot of paint when using steel; you have to use paint to guide against corrosion. All the paints used in the industry are blended and manufactured in Nigeria,” Wabote said. The Head, Legal Services of NCDMB, Barr Naboth Onyesoh, said the essence of the workshop was to ensure that stakeholders were brought in to support local content in implementation and enforcement of the Nigerian Content Act.
