According to Adedeji, the democratisation of the delivery business has succeeded in providing opportunities for individuals with means of transportation to earn extra income by embracing options available on Delivery platform to make their deliveries. He added that the platform also provides more jobs and Returns on Investments (RoI) for logistics companies across the nation.
