The Niger State Task Force on Illegal Slaughter Slabs has shut down illegal slaughter slabs operating in Minna, the state capital, and arrested 23 operators of the slabs. The task force, led by the Permanent Secretary in Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Ibrahim Garba Musa, said the shutdown and arrests were done after the elapse of a one-month quit notice issued to the operators to relocate to government recognised abattoirs. He said the state government would no longer watch butchers supply the public with unhygienic and contaminated meats, stressing that the task force operations would be sustained until all illegal slaughter slabs moved to the centralised abattoir at Tayi village in Minna. He noted that some of the animals slaughtered at the illegal abattoirs could be unhealthy or stolen ones, hence the need to checkmate such vices, assuring that the violators would be made to face the law. Areas raided by the task force include Kpakungu, Minna Club at the UK Bello Arts Theatre, behind GDSS, Maitumbi and Turaku PZ.
