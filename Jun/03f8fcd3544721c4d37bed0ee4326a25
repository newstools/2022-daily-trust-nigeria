A Lagos lawyer, Ladipo Johnson, has been picked by the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) as his running mate in the 2023 election. Mr Johnson was a former governorship candidate of the Alliance National Party, ANP in Lagos State before joining NNPP. The party announced this through its official Twitter handle on Saturday. “Road to 2023: Bar Ladipo Johnson is the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party,” the tweet read. The development comes hours after Doyin Okupe, who was named as the “placeholder” vice-presidential candidate for the Labour Party (LP), said talks were ongoing between his party and the NNPP on forming a coalition for the 2023 elections.
