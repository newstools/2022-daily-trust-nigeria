The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has announced commencement of the 2022 online verification and enrolment for retirees and prospective retirees of the federal government and treasury-funded Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). In a statement yesterday, PenCom stated that the exercise would commence on June 20, for employees scheduled to retire in 2022 and employees who missed the enrolment in previous years. The statement reads in part: “Prior to enrolment, all retirees/prospective retirees are required to visit their PFAs and undergo the data recapture exercise. This entails retirees/prospective retirees providing their personal details, including their National Identity Number (NIN). Retirees/prospective retirees who had undergone the data recapture exercise earlier are not required to repeat it.” It added that the prospective pensioners could perform the exercise through self-assistance or through pension desk officers or PFA-assisted retirees.
