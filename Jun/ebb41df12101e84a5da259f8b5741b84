The Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service (FCT-IRS) has approved the establishment of an independent tax office for Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Prior to the separation of IPPIS to a new office, it was under the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) tax office. It was gathered that the management of FCT-IRS thought it necessary to establish an independent tax office in order to aid prompt and effective service delivery and consequently improve revenue generation in the FCT. The new tax office, located at No 11, Block D on Kwame Nkrumah Street, off Yakubu Gowon Crescent, Asokoro, Abuja, began operations on June 1, 2022, with FCT-IRS advising taxpayers to visit the office for any transaction related to IPPIS. Ultimately, the IPPIS tax office will be in charge of taxes being collected from MDAs that are under IPPIS, and it will be headed by a tax controller. The acting Chairman of FCT-IRS, Mr Haruna Abdullahi, during a stakeholders meeting, said the management had taken deliberate measures and approaches to introduce reforms to boost revenue collection in the FCT. He said, “We have taken some measures in terms of innovations and reforms to change the narrative with a view to enhance our tax collection for the territory. “The benefits of these reforms may not be felt immediately, but gradually, and as time goes on we will begin to reap from the seeds we have sowed. “What I’m saying in essence is that this transformation will have long-term effects in terms of benefits for the services.”
