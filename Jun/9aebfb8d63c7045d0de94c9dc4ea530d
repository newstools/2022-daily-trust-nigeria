Presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Kingsley Moghalu, has resigned his membership of the party. In a letter addressed to the party chairman, Okey Nwosu, posted on his social media pages, the former deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), stated infractions from the primary election as reason for leaving the party. The resignation letter partly read, “I am writing to hand in my resignation from my membership of the African Democratic Congress, effective immediately. “I have resigned because the process and conduct of the party’s presidential primary on June 8, 2022 at Abeokuta revealed a fundamental clash of values between me and your leadership of the party. “Despite the circular you issued a few days prior to the primary committing the party to providing transportation and accommodation for delegates to and in Abeokuta, and which as we agreed would provide a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants, the party under your leadership failed to do so. “Some aspirants, including myself, made donations to the ADC party account as requested by the party for this purpose. “This failure, which appeared intentional, created room for massive abuses of the electoral process including delegate capture and financial inducement of delegates.” The presidential candidate of Young Progressive Party in the 2019 election, was defeated at the just concluded primary election of ADC in Abeokuta. While the winner, Dumebi Kachikwu, scored 977, Moghalu polled 589 votes.
