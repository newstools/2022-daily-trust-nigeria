 The Kano State House of Assembly yesterday elected Alhaji Kabiru Hassan Dashi, the member representing Kiru Constituency, as its new deputy speaker. Dashi’s election followed the resignation of the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Zubairu Hamza Massu, member representing Sumaila Constituency, who tendered his letter of resignation from the post. Recall that Massu recently defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Reading his resignation letter during plenary, the Speaker, Engr Hamisu Ibrahim Chidari, declared the deputy speaker’s seat vacant. After declaring the seat vacant, the member representing Dawakin Tofa, Hon Sale Ahmad Marke, nominated Dashi to be the new deputy speaker and the motion was seconded by the member representing Wudil, Hon Nuhu Abdullahi Achika. Dashi, a former deputy chief whip, deputy majority leader and majority leader of the house, agreed to become the new deputy speaker after his nomination was affirmed by 28 members of the 40-member house. He subsequently took oath of office as the deputy speaker which was administered by the Director, Legal, of the house, Barrister Nasidi Aliyu.
