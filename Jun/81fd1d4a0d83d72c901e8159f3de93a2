A governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC in Abia State, Daniel Eke, has demanded the cancellation of the party’s May 22 governorship primary in the state. Emenike and a former Minister, Uche Ogar, had emerged as candidates from parallel primaries held in the state. The aspirant, whose supporters staged a peaceful protest at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja, called on the national leadership of the APC to organise a fresh, direct and valid primaries where all the aspirants would be given equal opportunities to contest. Eke in a statement by the spokesperson of Daniel Eke Support Group, Agbaeze Uche Okocha, advised the party to avoid a legal quagmire that might jeopardise its chances at the main election. He noted that the implication of the scenario that played out on the primary’s day was that none of the claimants met the requirements of the law to be pronounced the party’s flag bearer, adding that the two processes could not pass the test of the extant laws.
