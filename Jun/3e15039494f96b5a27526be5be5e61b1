General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, has cautioned presidential candidates against single-faith tickets. He said having a presidential candidate and running mate of the same faith was a difficult and slippery area and urged candidates to “look at the heartbeat of the country and desires of the people before making their decisions.” He stated this yesterday while briefing reporters in Ilorin, Kwara State, after meeting with Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq. He said: “Political office holders should know that they are not there for themselves. They are there for all of us. “They should ask and do their research on and about what the country wants. And if they listen to the people, we will be confident that they will listen to us when they get there,” he said. On the prevailing security challenges in the country, he said: “I believe the security agents are doing their best but there’s room for improvement. “I want to credit the officers who are putting their lives on the line to secure the whole country. We should be praying for them that God will give them more wisdom and visible victory in the security of the country.” Governor Abdulrazaq commended the church for its empowerment programme, saying it was in line with his administration’s youth-focused agenda.
