According to him, it will achieve the objective through joint investments, in an all-inclusive participation that whittles down systemic shocks that are common with less diversified structures within the stock market. Kalu said it will empower cooperatives and social enterprises through access to and use of financial market instruments for long-term investments, especially in the dilution of costs of capital for cheaper financial costs of operations.
