The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) condemned an assault on its staff when a group of five staff members of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) visited its headquarters in Abuja. In a statement by the AEDC management on Tuesday, the power Distribution Company (DisCo) said the incident occurred on Monday, adding that the anti-graft team visited the AEDC premises without notice or any warrant “and violated the rights of law-abiding citizens of this country. “Several employees of the company were physically assaulted, unlawfully arrested and arbitrarily detained without cause or justification. These operatives acted unprofessionally and in absolute disregard of the laws and precepts of the country they were employed to serve,” it stated. AEDC said it will explore all legal measures to ensure redress for the violation of the staff rights, adding that the company values every member of staff and does not tolerate any intimidation, threat or assault by members of the public or any institution against any of its representatives in the course of discharging their duties. “In the meantime, we implore our staff to remain steadfast and law-abiding citizens as they perform their lawful duties,” it urged the staff. When contacted, the spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, told Daily Trust that he was not aware of the operatives’ action at the AEDC headquarters. ‘’I can’t speak on that because I don’t have that information yet. I was not participating, so, I can’t react to what I am not aware of,’’ said Uwujaren on telephone.  By Simon Echewofun Sunday & Idowu Isamotu
