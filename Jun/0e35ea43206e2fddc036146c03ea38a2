A first-class monarch and the Eselu of Iselu Kingdom, Yewa North LGA of Ogun State, Oba Akintunde Akinyemi, has urged the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to deploy closed-circuit television and security gadgets in churches. That, he said, would help to curtail security threats. Oba Eselu gave the advice in an open letter to the CAN president, Supo Ayokunle, made available to newsmen following Sunday killings of over 40 worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. The monarch warned that if proactive measures were not taken, such an occurrence could discourage a lot of worshippers from attending church services. “The video footage from the ‘closed-circuit televisions (CCTV) will continually assist the church authorities to raise alarm to security agents when the need arises,” he said. The monarch commiserated with the state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu; the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin; and the Christian community in Ondo.
