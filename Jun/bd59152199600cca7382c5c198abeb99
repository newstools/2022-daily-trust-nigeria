Youths under the auspices of the Coalition of FCT Concerned Youths have threatened to shut down roads leading to the nation’s capital if the elected council chairmen and their councillors are not sworn in within the next 48 hours. Comrade Joshua Yohanna Dangiwa, the convener of the group, asked the FCT Minister, Muhammed Musa Bello, and the judiciary to do the needful and allow the people’s mandate to stand. He recalled that during their last protest on May 20, at the FCTA Secretariat, the Permanent Secretary, Olusola Adesola, promised that the administration would look into the case within 48 hours, but nothing was heard since then. He said the youths were peace-loving residents but would do everything within the law to ensure that the duly elected officials were allowed into their offices. Dangiwa further said as a result of the crisis, workers in the area councils have not received their May salary because the monthly Joint Account Allocation Committee (JAAC) meeting was not held. He appealed to the FCT minister to wade into the crisis without further delay, assuring him that the natives were behind him.
