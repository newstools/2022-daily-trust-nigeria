The transport section of Dangote Cement Plc has launched the Dangote Articulated Truck Driving School to stem the tide of road traffic accidents. Commissioning the school on Wednesday, Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Boboye Oyeyemi, said it was historic and unique. He said, “This is what we had been waiting for. You made it. I have observed that Dangote has done a lot to address truck crashes, and I must commend them for this.” The Director, Logistics of Dangote Cement (transport section), Mr Juan Carlos Rincon, said the school was an expression of the determination of the company to halt the incidences of auto crashes in the country. The Executive Secretary of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Prof Idris Bugaje, said NBTE would partner Dangote Cement for a successful accreditation and takeoff of the school. The Bajana of Obajana, HRH Oba Idowu Isenibi, said he was optimistic that the school would help address auto crashes in the country, even as he described the President of the Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, as a “rescuer and God sent” to their communities that should be emulated by other investors in the country. The Olu of Akpata Oba Frederick Balogun urged other investors to emulate the company. After the launch, Dangote Cement and FRSC signed a pact to strengthen cooperation on successful operation of the school.
