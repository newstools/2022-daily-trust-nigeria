The Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars in Nigeria (CYMSN) has urged the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to choose a Muslim of Yoruba extraction as its presidential candidate for the 2023 election. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, the group’s Acting President General, Sheikh AbdurRasheed Mayaleke, said Yoruba Muslims had been relegated to the background when it comes to the issues of the presidency. He said: “The Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars in Nigeria has noted with deep concern the unfolding scenarios with respect to the election of candidates by political parties ahead of the 2023 General elections in Nigeria. “The assumption and attempt to permanently disenfranchise the Southern Muslims the opportunity to aspire for highest position of president or vice president of the country is undemocratic, injurious and will be resisted with all legal means available.” When contacted, Atiku’s media aide, Paul Ibe, said it was unfortunate that a religious group would veer off tandem into the political arena. “However, the future that Atiku Abubakar envisages for Nigeria is one country of one people with one future in which every tribe, tongue and faith will stand united. “Above all, it is incumbent on religious and community leaders to preach peace rather than division. “Suffice it to say that Atiku Abubakar’s fate in the 2023 presidential election will be determined by Nigerian voters who are well informed about the broken state of our political and socio-economic life,” Ibe said.
