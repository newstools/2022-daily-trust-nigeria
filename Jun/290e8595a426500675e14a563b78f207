For car enthusiasts and the popular high net-worth individuals (HNIs) desiring a vehicle that can withstand the tough terrains of Nigeria, the 2022 Ford Bronco comes very handy. Courtesy of Coscharis Motors Plc, a leading automobile dealer in Nigeria and the exclusive distributors of Ford, the Bronco stood out at this year’s Lagos Motor Fair held in Victoria Island in the Centre of Excellence. The Bronco comes with a standard 300-hp turbocharged 2.3-litre four-cylinder or an optional 330-hp twin-turbo 2.7-litre V-6. A 10-speed automatic transmission bolts to both gas engines, but a seven-speed manual is only compatible with the smaller one. Available with two or four doors, soft tops or hardtops, and removable body panels, the Bronco offers the same open-air possibilities that make the Wrangler an outdoor person’s delight. The Ford’s interior has a few more innovations than the jeep, too. Its infotainment system supports a host of modern features that include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and a subscription-based Wi-Fi hotspot. According to the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group, Abiona Babarinde, Ford is a good family car and a delightful off-road SUV for vacation with a five-seater sitting capacity. He calls it, ‘The Rebirth of Bronco’. “The Ford Bronco is not just coming out for the first time. It has been there. It is just rebirthing and it has nothing to do with any other brands. It is strictly a Ford Brand. “This is a vehicle that has been an instant success story and going by the pedigree of Ford globally, Ford has been an iconic brand we are always very proud of,” he stated. Asked about the target market for the Bronco, Abiona said, “The targets for this Bronco are what we call the HNIs and also car enthusiasts. Basically, if you are a traveller, it is also a family vehicle, that’s a five-passenger vehicle and you want to go probably off-road, go to the beach. There is a lot of stress in this country.”
