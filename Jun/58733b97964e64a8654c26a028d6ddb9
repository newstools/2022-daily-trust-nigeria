 Samsung Heavy Industries Nigeria Limited (SHIN) has alerted members of the public that imposters are impersonating themselves as the company’s agents, consultants, advisors, and representatives in projects in the oil and gas, as well as maritime industries. A statement by the SHIN Management yesterday stated that the impostors “falsely claim that they represent the company and also have the company’s authority to engage, negotiate and discuss with clients on the company’s behalf.” It however warned that while it has “bonafide advisers and partners”, it had not engaged any person or entity “to transact business with the public or corporate organisations in respect to business opportunities in the oil and gas, and maritime industries in Nigeria. “Any organisation or person who deals with these persons or entities does so at their own risk,” the company said. SHIN also reiterated its commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy and human capital resources of Nigeria and expressed its gratitude for the support from all stakeholders.
