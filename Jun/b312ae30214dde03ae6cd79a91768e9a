It also restrained the party from refusing to receive and transmit the name of Mr Ifeanyi Ọdịi, who won the cancelled governorship primary to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the candidate of the party for the Ebonyi 2023 governorship election. The judge noted that the rescheduled primary poll was held in flagrant disregard to the party’s guidelines and constitution. He also said the rescheduled primary election flouted the Electoral Law as amended as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not monitor the said election. Senator Ọgba won the rescheduled election, which the court declared null, void and illegal.
