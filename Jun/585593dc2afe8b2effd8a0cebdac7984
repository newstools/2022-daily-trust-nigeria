By Daniel Dada A socio-political organisation, Njem Igbo Initiative, has condemned the “merchandising of political positions” in Nigeria that characterise selection of candidates of some political parties. In a statement signed by its Global Coordinator, Comrade Chidozie Okoli, the group condemned in its entirety the whole process of producing the Nigerian president. Okoli explained that a level and fair playing ground was necessary for Nigeria to get it right, adding that a faulty process could not produce a clean product. The statement reads in part: “It is rather appalling that the process through which the political leadership emerges in Nigeria is corrupt and erratic. “Political leadership has now become the business of the highest bidder. “We have seen from the just concluded 2022 national convention/primary elections of the People’s Democratic Party which produced a presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections with the delegates, and by extension the electorate, being sold and bought for mere pecuniary benefits. “This shows the level of decadence in our electoral process in this country.’’ The group, therefore, admonished Nigerians to root for men and women of character with sound moral standing who would represent the people at all levels of governance.
