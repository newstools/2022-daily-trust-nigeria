A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, Daniel Eke, has demanded the cancellation of the party’s May 22 governorship primary in the state. Emenike and a former minister, Uche Ogar, had emerged as candidates from parallel primaries held in the state. The aspirant, whose supporters staged a peaceful protest at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja, called on the national leadership of the APC to organise a fresh, direct and valid primaries where all the aspirants would be given equal opportunities to contest. Eke, in a statement by the spokesperson for Daniel Eke Support Group, Agbaeze Uche Okocha, advised the party to avoid a legal quagmire that might jeopardise its chances at the main election. He noted that the implication of the scenario that played out on the primary’s day was that none of the claimants met the requirements of the law to be pronounced the party’s flag bearer, adding that the two processes could not pass the test of the extant laws. He said, “The electoral committee that came to Abia from the party headquarters conducted the indirect primary election even without notifying Chief Daniel Eke of the time, venue and mode of election, despite that he purchased the APC expression of interest and nomination forms with the whooping sum of N50 million and was duly screened by the party. “The NWC should intervene now and fix a new date for the primary, then communicate the date to all the aspirants, and allow a free and fair election where all card carrying members of the party shall vote in the transparent process.”
