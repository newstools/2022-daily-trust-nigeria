 A chieftain of the APC in Ekiti State, Dr Olusegun Osinkolu, has rejoiced with the governor-elect of Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, on his victory in last Saturday’s poll in the state. In a congratulatory message yesterday, Osinkolu said Oyebanji should deliver good governance to the people after his swearing in as the next governor of the state. Osinkolu said, “Biodun Oyebanji’s victory is a well-deserved one, and this will come with a price, which is to reciprocate with superlative performance after being sworn in. “Oyebanji’s coming on board at a time like this is special in so many ways. He is the first indigenous politician to assume the governorship seat in the progressives fold and his full grasp of the political dynamics would be of tremendous advantage to deliver to our people. “The stunning margin of victory is an indication that Ekiti voters had risen the stake and are expecting more democracy dividends in the next dispensation, and APC must map out the requisite strategy to deliver and meet the yearnings of the people.”
