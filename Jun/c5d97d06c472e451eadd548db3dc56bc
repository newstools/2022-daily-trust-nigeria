Kinsmen tackle Tinubu over outburst on Abiodun, say ‘it’s demeaning’ Zamfara PDP govship candidate woos aggrieved aspirants The State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) said, “Upon arrival at the incident scene, an articulated truck laden with a 20ft container was found accidented at the railway crossing at the aforementioned location.” Permanent Secretary of LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu in an update on the incident said further investigation “revealed that the truck driver poorly navigated the bad sections of the road and as a result, the truck overturned onto the rail tracks.” While no life was lost in the incident, he confirmed that an adult male passerby was injured as a result of the incident. He said, “The Agency’s heavy-duty forklift has been dispatched to evacuate the truck off the rail track to eliminate a secondary train accident. “Unfortunately the operation is being hampered by miscreants at the scene. Request for armed intervention by Nigeria Police has been made.” As of the time of filing this report, the accidented truck and container have both been recovered from the rail track to a nearby layby. “The axis s now safe for both rail and road traffic. Recovery operation concluded,” LASEMA boss said.
