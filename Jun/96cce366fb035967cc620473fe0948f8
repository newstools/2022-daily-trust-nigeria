 Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State have called on the governorship aspirants who lost the primary to put their grievances aside and work for the party’s victory at the poll. A chieftain of the party, Saleh Mandung Zazzaga made the call while speaking with newsmen yesterday in Jos, the Plateau State capital after paying a solidarity visit to APC governorship candidate, Nentawe Yilwatda. Zazzaga urged all the other aspirants to close ranks and work for the success of the party. “I want to also use this opportunity to call on all the party members, loyalists and supporters alike who must have been aggrieved one way or the other to put behind them whatever must have vexed them so that we can work for the success of the party. “For the aspirants who were not victorious at the primaries in all other positions, they should understand that it is not the end of their political career, because a loser today can become a winner tomorrow.” He also urged Yilwatda to reach out to all other aspirants who contested with him.
