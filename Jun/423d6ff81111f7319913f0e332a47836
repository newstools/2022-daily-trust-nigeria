WikiFX, a platform promoting forex trading, has called on investors that are either into forex trading or have an interest in it to get the necessary knowledge if they want to succeed. At a seminar in Kano, the organisers of the event, Abdulmajid Shehu Zakar and Hamza Abdulkarim of WiKiFX said the firm organised the event to teach people who are interested in forex or want to enhance their trading results how to trade forex, and it was a huge success. “The goal of the one-day seminar was to help traders understand the current situation of forex trading, and how to mitigate in the future, ‘’ said one of the organisers, Hamza. Aushazu Mukhtar Dahiru from T2B Academy, said most people lost their money if they did not get the ideal brokers. He therefore called on newbies coming into the market, which he said is wide, to kindly consult; get the basic knowledge before going into the trading. Salahuddeen Sani from SS.DBT Forex Training Centre, Kano, said although forex trading is very profitable, many investors lost their money due to lack of experience and skills. “Forex trading is considered one of the most profitable businesses. However, many investors lose money in the forex market every year, especially inexperienced investors or newbies. The reason why so many people lose money in the forex market is that they know little about forex trading or they don’t have a strategy when investing,” he said. WikiFX also signed a pact with the two resource persons to set up online forex classes.
