 The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara State, Mr Garuba Attahiru Madami, has handed down a 48-hour ultimatum to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to retract and apologise over a “malicious statement” by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Prince Tunji Morounfoye, against him. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Ilorin, Madami said the PDP risked legal action if it refused to apologise in the print and electronic media within 48 hours. The PDP spokesman, Morounfoye, had alleged that the REC collected N300m from the Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq-led government to manipulate the 2023 general elections in the state and called for his redeployment. He further quoted him (Madami) as saying, “I totally hate Saraki and will do anything in my power to stop him in Kwara State during a management meeting.” But the REC described the allegations as false and lies with intent to defame his integrity and name built over the years. He said, ”I am giving Kwara PDP 48 hours for a public apology in print and electronic media, of which after expiration, I will take a legal action for defamation of character and assassination of my integrity built over 40 years which I had proven here in Kwara since assumption of office on July 25, 2018.” On the call for his redeployment from the state by the PDP, Madami said it was the prerogative of the INEC, led by its Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu. He assured the people of Kwara that INEC under his watch would conduct free, fair, credible, transparent and peaceful elections come 2023. When contacted to react on the threat, Morounfoye said the party was yet to take a decision on the matter.
