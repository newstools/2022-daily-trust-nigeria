A farmer, Idris Sodangi, who was shot on the ear and mouth by bandits at Masuku village in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State, has lost hearing and speech. City & Crime gathered that the victim, who is on admission at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Shika-Zaria, still has pellets of bullets in his body. It was gathered that Sodangi was shot three weeks ago when bandits invaded his community. His brother, Jimada Awwal Iliyasu Bassa, told City & Crime that, “Because of the level of damage done by the bullets that penetrated through his ear and mouth, doctors have told us that his tongue and lower jaw have been damaged. So, he will no longer talk and he won’t swallow. He’s now being fed through his nose. “Doctors have told us that they have to source for a bone from a part of his body and rearrange his lower jaw before the final surgery. “So, we have been referred to the 44 Army Hospital for CT scanning.” The Co-Convener of Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki, told City & Crime that about N400,000 was required for the surgery, calling for support from government and individuals, noting that the victm’s family had been exhausted financially.
