 The National Peace Committee (NPC) headed by a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (Rtd.), has said widespread financial inducement may affect the credibility of the 2023 general elections. Gen. Abdulsalami said this last night in a statement he personally signed on the coming June 18 Ekiti State governorship election. The committee, which has the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah as the secretary, also noted the acrimonious conduct of the recent party primaries and the elevation of the ‘delegate position’ over and above the welfare of ordinary Nigerians. “We are aware that the 2023 election may not be the best as can be attested to by the monetisation of the process, the acrimonious conduct of the recent party primaries, and the elevation of the ‘delegate position’ over and above the welfare of ordinary Nigerians,” Abdulsalami said. The committee also urged voters in the governorship election in Ekiti State to choose peace over and above electoral violence. In the statement also signed by the Head of Secretariat of the NPC, Fr. Atta Barkindo, Gen. Abdulsalami urged the people of the state to step out without fear, but with the hope to exercise their franchise and vote to deepen the democratic process in Ekiti. The NPC also announced that a peace accord will be signed by the various political parties and stakeholders on Wednesday in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.
