The presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, has said the refusal of some Nigerians to vote during elections is why bad governance has persisted in the country. In an interview with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Kachikwu said Nigerians keep on electing leaders without vision for the country because the middle class boycott elections due to fear of violence and the belief that their vote would not count.

Some parties like the ADC made it free for women, youth and people with disabilities to run but we saw the apathy and people did not take up the challenge. “The apathy in Nigeria is at all times high, no faith in government and governance. This apathy has kept us in a situation where these parties keep on coming back to rule us,” he said.
