Supporters of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, have rejected “plot” by some elements in the party to nominate its presidential candidate through consensus. The supporters, under the aegis of Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO) and Northern Young Professionals for Tinubu (NYPT), said the former Lagos State governor should be compensated for the role he played in the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Briefing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, the National Coordinator of NYPT, Abdullahi Tanko Yakasai, alleged that some elements in the APC were plotting a consensus against Tinubu. Yakasai said, “The party cannot afford at this time to allow some few selfish individuals circumvent the universal practice of due process and the laid down rules as contained in our party’s constitution for picking candidates for various elective positions to contest elections. “We see such machinations being orchestrated by enemies within the party to undermine the ambitions of our principal, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “We also want to use this opportunity to call on our delegates, especially from Northern Nigeria, to vote for a man that is strong enough to give us a sense of victory.” Also, the National Coordinator of Disciples of Jagaban (DOJ), a Tinubu support group, Abdulhakeem Alawuje, said only Tinubu can defeat the former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate. He warned that any attempt to edge out Tinubu by the APC cabals would amount to “playing politics with the tail of the biggest cobra in the world.” “If they do, they must regret it as it will consume them,” he said.
