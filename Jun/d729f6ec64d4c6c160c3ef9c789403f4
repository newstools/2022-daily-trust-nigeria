The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has expressed appreciation to Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State for the ‘historic role’ he played in his emergence as the party’s flag bearer. This is contained in a statement issued by the Special Adviser Media and Publicity to Tambuwal, Malam Muhammad Bello, in Sokoto on Monday. Bello said a group of Atiku’s supporters from the North-East zone had arrived Sokoto to deliver the former vice president’s message of gratitude to the governor. He said the group, comprising various stakeholders in the North East zone and a coalition of businessmen, was led by Alhaji Muhammadu Kirfi (Wazirin Bauchi). Bello said the visit was the third time Atiku and his associates would be in the state since May 29 when Tambuwal dropped his aspiration in support of the former vice president during the PDP’s special convention. He quoted the leader of the delegation as saying that the visit was at the behest of the PDP presidential flag bearer, to commend Tambuwal for his decision to drop his ambition and support him during the presidential primary election. “The action taken by Governor Tambuwal has demonstrated that he is a committed leader who always has his people’s interest above his own. “Tambuwal did show his love for the unity of Northern Nigeria and the country in general. We pray to God to uplift him and reward him abundantly,” Kirfi said. In his remarks, Tambuwal said he took the decision to step aside for Atiku as a sacrifice for the development and unity of the country and PDP as well as the desire to save the nation from imminent collapse. “The country is presently facing countless challenges in terms of security and economy, among others. Hence the need to join hands together to rescue Nigerians from the present state,” he said.  (NAN)
