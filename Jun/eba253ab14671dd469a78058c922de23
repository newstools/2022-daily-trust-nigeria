A Kano Sharia Court on Thursday ordered that a 28-year-old man, Badamasi Abubakar, be remanded in a correctional centre for lifting a woman’s veil without her consent. Abubakar, who lives in Dan Marke Hotoro Quarters, Kano, pleaded guilty to indecent assault. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Insp Abdul Wada, told the court that Ms Summaiya Abdul of Dan Marke Hotoro Quarters, reported the matter at the Hotoro Police Station on June 21. The prosecutor said that the complainant alleged that at about 4pm, the defendant lifted her veil without her consent and when she confronted him, he slapped her. Wada said the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 165 and 166 of the Penal Code. The Judge, Ismai’l Muhammed-Ahmed, adjourned the matter until July 27 for sentence.
