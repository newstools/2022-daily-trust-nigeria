The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), Abubakar Atiku, has rolled out a three-point agenda, targeting privatisation of refineries, rail sector, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and breaking monopoly of all other infrastructure operations. According to his tweet on Thursday, Atiku said his economic agenda has a comprehensive objective of providing a more hospitable environment for businesses to thrive and create jobs and wealth for Nigerian citizens. “And to achieve these, I have three guiding principles to go by…” he stated. The first is his reaffirmation of the criticality of private sector leadership and greater private sector participation in development. While doing this, he also hopes to reposition the public sector to focus on its core responsibility of facilitation and enabling the appropriate legal and regulatory framework for rapid economic and social development. He said his second economic agenda is to: “Break government monopoly in all infrastructure sectors, including the refineries, rail transportation and power transmission and give private investors a larger role in funding and managing the sectors, thus emulating the benefits accrued in the oil and gas and telecoms sectors.” The third agenda of the PDP presidential flagbearer and former vice president of Nigeria is to:  “Allow the market greater leverage in determining prices.” He said this will eliminate the persistent price distortions occasioned by current interventionist exchange rate management policy. “Government intervention, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibly and judiciously,” he noted. Daily Trust reports that the concept of public infrastructure privatisation became visible under former president Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice president Atiku, a policy that saw the liberalization of the telecom sector as well as the housing sector.
