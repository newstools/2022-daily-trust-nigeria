Operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) have arrested a campus journalist, Jeremiah Omoniyi, who was covering the ongoing governorship election in Ekiti State. Omoniyi, a student at the Ekiti State University, was deployed to the polling station by the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID). He was arrested by the DSS for posting a video which showed some party agents engaging in fisticuffs at PU 001, Ward 01, Irepodun Ifelodun LGA. The polling unit is that of Ayodele Fayose, former Ekiti governor. The DSS operatives, said to be about 15, arrived at the polling unit to ask for who posted the video before they approached Omoniyi. The journalist, however, reportedly denied posting the video. While some political leaders said there is a massive voter turnout, others alleged there have been cases of vote buying. Biodun Olujimi, senator representing Ekiti Central, said the voter turnout in the Ekiti governorship election was massive. But Kemi Elebute-Halle, the governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Ekiti, alleged that other political parties were inducing voters with money.
