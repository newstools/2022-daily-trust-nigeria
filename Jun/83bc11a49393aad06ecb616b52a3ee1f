Real Life Global Humanitarian Affairs Foundation has urged the federal government to expedite the use of biotechnology for increased yields through genetic modified seeds and save the country from importation of food products. Its National Coordinator of Real Life, Engr Akinsola Akinsoji, during a chat with Daily Trust, stated that the increased rate of insecurity had deterred farmers from accessing their farmlands, but that biotech could help to secure food security in the country. Akinsoji added that with South Africa earning over $600m from genetic modified seeds in 20 years, it could be replicated in Nigeria and help widen the government’s revenue. He said, “For some reasons we are yet to adopt technology in our farms even as modernised farming is yet to kick-start in large scale, but without the adoption of technology, we will not be able to feed Nigerians. We all know what happened when the border was shut against rice.” He further said the use of the modified cowpea seed in the country was slow due to opposition by producers of pesticides, but pointed out that larger economic value would increase revenue base if farmers and government adopted biotech. On whether farmers can afford it, he stated that the seeds were readily available to the farmers and that they didn’t have to spend much money on it. “The government has already established the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) and they are working assiduously to make sure that the technology is made simple for every Nigerian. Our work is to break it down to the people. Farmers do not have the economic power and understanding, so we get training from the agencies and take it to them in their local languages.”
