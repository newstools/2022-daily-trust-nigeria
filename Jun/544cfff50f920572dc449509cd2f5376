The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has certified 12 companies in Kano towards improving product standardisation. The Director General of the Agency Malam Faruk Salim stated this during the presentation of certificate of Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) to the 12 companies operating in Kano Wednesday. Represented by the Regional Director of the SON, Mr Albert Wilberforce, he said the certificate is not a ‘cash and carry’ exercise, rather a scientific approach to ensure all facets of production are compiled with relevant standards. He noted that the exercise ensures that all local products comform with the relevant National Industrial Standard (NIS) prior to display in the Nigerian market. The State coordinator, Kano state office of SON, Kasssim Muhammed-Yahaya, said the programme is a continuous inspection and correction efforts to confront standard issues. On his part, the Director Administration, Kano State Consumer Protection Council, Sambo Illiyasu, said the agency will sustain its partnership with SON in making companies produce standard products.
