Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has inaugurated the Fan Milk Danone Model Dairy Farm in Odeda Farm Institute, while calling for more investors to come to the state. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Abiodun described agriculture as an important sector in providing jobs and security for the people. He said, “We are walking our talk in the agricultural sector. With the establishment of the farm, about 1,000 young people were trained in the supply chain of milk. “This farm institute is the oldest around here and the farm is very important to source milk locally. We are happy to be part of the successful stories because the milk collection will complement our other products like cassava, poultry among others”, he said. The French Ambassador to Nigeria, Emmanuelle Blatmann, said the project was a perfect commitment to passion for Public-Private Partnership (PPP), applauding the governor for his strong involvement to ensure that the project became a reality. Special Adviser to the President on Development Policy, Prof Mohammed Salisu, said the federal government was committed to meeting the nutritional needs of Nigeria, noting that the establishment of the dairy farm was a good omen that should be encouraged. The Chairman of Fan Milk Plc, Mr Olatinka Akinkugbe, hinted that the farm would create about 2,000 jobs for the people of the area, appreciating the state government for its support.
