Senator Adamu Aliero has emerged as the Kebbi Central senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 elections. Daily Trust reports that the primary was quickly organised to accommodate Aliero, who had just defected to the party from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Aliero, an incumbent senator, left APC after he withdrew from the party’s primary that saw the emergence of Kebbi State Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu as the flagbearer for Kebbi Central. Bagudu won unopposed. Haruna Sa’id, who had earlier secured the ticket of PDP, contested against Aliero in the fresh primary held yesterday. Announcing the result, the chairman of the election committee, Barr Baba Lawal Aliyu, said Aliero scored 246 votes while Sa’id polled 15 votes. With his emergence, Senator Aliero will battle in the 2023 senatorial election with Governor Bagudu, the candidate of APC.
