Supporters of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, have urged President Muhammadu Buhari and other party leaders to provide a level playing field for all the aspirants to contest the presidential ticket. The National Coordinator, the Disciples of Jagaban, Abdulhakeem Adegoke Alawuje, in a statement yesterday, said the former Lagos governor was not asking for the APC ticket on a platter of gold. He said it would be anti-democratic to impose an “anointed candidate” on the party members and Nigerians for general elections. He said: “Those of us who are APC members and who have supported the Buhari/Tinubu combination since 2014 are not asking that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu should be handed the APC presidential ticket on a platter, but let’s have a level playing field. “And if we truly claim to be practising democracy, let democracy take its toll. Let the popular candidate emerge. “Let there be no imposition or anointed candidate. APC is not owned by President Muhammadu Buhari. He has nothing to lose after he has completed his tenure and he must not be allowed to have his way against the wish of the majority. “Illegality cannot beget illegality, if the governors are committing illegality in their small states, why should that be perpetuated at the Federal level. “Nigerian should therefore not allow less than fifty members of the cabal to fritter the welfare of more than two hundred and fifty million individuals on the altar of self-aggrandizement.”
