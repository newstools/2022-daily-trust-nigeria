A support group with the ruling party, APC National Coalition for Mass Mobilisation (NATCOMM) has passed a vote of confidence on the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee of the party, urging all committee members to work with him. The national coordinator of the group, Comrade Musa Ali Otigba, in a statement issued in Abuja yesterday, expressed concern over what he described as a “media war” embarked upon by some NWC members against Adamu in recent times. He noted that what the APC needed at this time was cohesion to ensure that the Adamu-led NWC “has the right frame of mind to perform the onerous task of leading the party to victory in the upcoming general elections.”
