About 30 business entities in hotel, medical and hospitality participated in a tourism road show held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, organised by the Department of Dubai Economy and Tourism. Speaking at the event yesterday, the Regional Director, International Operations of Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, Stella Fubara, said the show was organised to assist travel agents and tour operators operating in Nigeria to improve their businesses and know more about the destinations that really served Nigeria. Ms Fubara said, “Normally, we do road shows in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja, and now we are extending it to Kano. COVID came and we had to suspend the road show. This is the first time back since 2020. “The reason for the road show is to assist travel agents and tour operators in Nigeria to improve their businesses, to know more about the destinations that really serve Nigeria and help them grow the economy.” Chief Executive Officer of the Rivers State Tourism Board, Mr Yibo Koko, said the road show would expose tourism and travel agents to business opportunities in Dubai, as well as grow the economy of the state.
