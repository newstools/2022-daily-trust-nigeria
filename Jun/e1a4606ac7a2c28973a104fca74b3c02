A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Senator Victor Umeh, has said that his defection to the Labour Party (LP) is a divine intervention to reconcile with a former Governor of Anambra State and presidential candidate of the party, Peter Obi. Umeh, who is LP’s candidate for Anambra Central Senatorial seat, stated this yesterday at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat in Awka, the state capital. He said the conspiracy against him by some APGA members in Anambra that cost him the party’s return ticket was God’s design to reunite with his brother, Obi, noting that the ill-treatment meted out to him led to his defection to the LP. According to him, “During the last senatorial primary for Anambra Central Senatorial District which I contested in APGA, it was glaring that some people within the party perfectly wheeled conspiracy to pull me down, and that was why I decided to leave APGA.” Umeh further said he joined LP on the advice of its presidential candidate, Obi, adding that he was happy because God had once again brought them together. He said, “Nigerians from all shades of opinions want Peter Obi as president in 2023, and what is happening in LP is divine. What is driving him is statements he makes on the management of the resources of the country which truly represent his conduct on the ways public resources should be managed.
