The lawmaker representing Kebbi South Senatorial District, Senator Bala Ibn Na’Allah, has said Nigeria adopted a bicameral legislature for the purposes of checks and balances and to keep the country united. Speaking at the launch of a book titled, ‘Zuru People of Northwest’ in Abuja, Na’allah, said the outcome of the constitutional conference that birthed the Fourth Republic saw the minority expressing fear of the northern region dominating the affairs of the country, thus, called for equality. “Other regions were afraid that if the north was united, we would have everything, this issue was raised at the constitutional conference and the fears of the minorities were raised and it was resolved that we should have a bicameral system where no house is greater than the other. “The senate was created based on equality; therefore, each state has three senators, the idea is to checkmate, with the greatest respect, the rascality of the younger ones that have the capacity to injure the fragile unity that the military has fought for to unite this country.”
