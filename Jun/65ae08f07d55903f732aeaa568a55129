The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), City of David Parish, Abuja has appealed to the federal government to devise alternative justice measures to ensure the decongestion of prisons in Nigeria. A senior pastor of the church, Pastor  Ayodele Adewale made this appeal over the weekend during the church’s visit to Nigerian Correction Service facilities in Kuje, Gwagwalada, and Suleija. This, the church said, was due to the few number of courts and judges in the country, who are being overworked. “We have too few courts, and the magistrates and judges are humans, and there is a limit to which you can drag the human body,” he said. The church, under its Christian Social Responsibility (CSR), donated various items to the inmates of the correctional centres.
