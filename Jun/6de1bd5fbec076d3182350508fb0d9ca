A former Labour Party Chairman in Anambra State, Jude Ezenwafor, has emerged as the presidential candidate of the party’s faction loyal to Calistus Uju Okafor. Ezenwafor emerged unopposed at the special national convention of Okafor’s faction of the party held yesterday in Abuja. His candidacy was affirmed through voice votes by the delegates from across the 36 states of the federation and FCT. Speaking to newsmen shortly after, Okafor said his position and actions were based on the need to ensure justice, fairness and equity, stressing that he had nothing against former Governor Peter Obi, whom the other faction of the Labour Party had presented as its presidential candidate. Meanwhile, the conveners of the third force movement have raised the alarm over the plan to scuttle their alliance against the ruling APC and the main opposition PDP. Spokesman for the group under the aegis of the National Consultative Front (NCFRONT), Dr Yunusa Tanko, raised the alarm on Wednesday in Abuja. “The attention of the 3rd force movement is drawn to attempts of anti-democratic forces targeted towards causing disharmony in our chosen political party, the Labour Party (LP), selected to lead our collective struggle. “One Mr Calistus Okafor has laid claim to the leadership of the Labour Party. In order to set the records straight and after careful investigation, the said Mr Calistus Okafor is no longer a member of the Labour Party.”  By Abdullateef Salau & Abbas Jimoh
