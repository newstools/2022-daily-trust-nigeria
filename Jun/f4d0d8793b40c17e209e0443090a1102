 As the federal government works toward increasing the aviation sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from $1.7bn annually to $14.16bn in the next 20 years, stakeholders in the sector, industry experts and investors around the world are eying the ample investment opportunities in the sector. Come June 14-17, 2022, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) will initiate its national aviation conference, the first of its kind, since its establishment to galvanize the aviation sector with far-reaching impacts through brainstorming, engaging interaction and providing a platform for investors. Tagged FNAC, the investors and stakeholders’ forum taking place in Abuja is aimed at filling a perceived vacuum in the sub-region as there are currently no such platforms for the interaction. Daily Trust reports that the conference was scheduled to hold in 2020 but was truncated by the COVID-19 pandemic which grounded the sector as the whole world shut down with the aviation sector mostly affected. With the theme “Advancing the Frontiers of Possibilities for Safe, Secure and Profitable Air Transport”, the forum will enable stakeholders to brainstorm and share knowledge and ideas on contemporary developments which will provide veritable solutions to the growth of the industry. The Managing Director of FAAN, Captain Rabiu Hamisu Yadudu, said the conference will seek collaboration with state governments and potential investors to explore the huge investment opportunities in the state through the airports. It is believed that this will open up new air routes with a corresponding increase in passenger traffic and a win-win for all stakeholders.
