A former Chief Judge (CJ) of Anambra State, Prof Peter Umeadi, has emerged as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). He clinched the ticket unopposed at a special convention yesterday in Abuja where 150 delegates affirmed his candidacy through voice vote. The convention was attended by party leaders and members drawn from the six geo-political zones. The party’s National Chairman, Dr Victor Ike Oye, expressed optimism that Umeadi would be sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. In his acceptance speech, Prof Umeadi promised to make Nigeria a great country, where justice would reign for all citizens equally irrespective of tribe or status. He said, “My solemn pledge is to develop Nigeria from within. I would work assiduously for sound education, affordable health care, food and security of lives and property.” Meanwhile, a House of Representatives member, Chris Azubogu, has emerged as APGA’s candidate for Anambra South Senatorial District. Azubogu will battle the incumbent Senator, Ifeanyi Ubah, of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) and Chief Chris Uba of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the general elections next year.
