Enyinnaya Abaribe, a senator representing Abia-South Senatorial District of Abia State and immediate former minority leader of the Senate has expressed strong pessimism over the success of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 presidential race. He stated this on Arise TV on Wednesday while speaking about his recent defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) that consequently led to his resignation as the Senate’s minority leader. He also spoke on issues regarding the forthcoming 2023 presidential election. The former deputy governor of Abia State said he resigned as the minority leader of the Senate on grounds of principles, and that Nigeria is not ready for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in a presidential election. He said, “People always assume that when you are sitting in an office, you always want that office and because of that you are ready to swallow anything. But you could see the majority leader who walked away. The minority leader too, I walked away. We left the office to show that the office is not important and what is important are the Nigerian people. “If the APC wake up and say that they are going to do a Muslim-Muslim whatever, what it will lead to is abysmal failure. Which Christian will trust a Muslim-Muslim ticket? And which Muslim will vote a Christian-Christian ticket?’’ Abaribe had in May dumped the PDP for APGA due to a “shambolic electoral process in the state, driven by a procured court injunction.” The lawmaker, had resigned about 48 hours after his withdrawal from the Abia State governorship race, lamenting about the party’s use of “an imaginary three-man ad hoc delegate and the exclusion of the party’s statutory delegates” in the primary elections to elect candidates.
