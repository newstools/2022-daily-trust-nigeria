The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) have urged the leadership of organised labour not to compromise the demands of the striking workers in the state. The workers on Tuesday began an indefinite strike over unremitted 21 months deductions, and eight years leave bonus, among other issues.

Speaking with newsmen on Wednesday, the State Chairman of NNPP, Oginni Olaposi, blamed the strike on Governor Dapo Abiodun’s “incompetence and insensitivity to the workers’ plight.” He urged workers not to compromise until their demands are met. Also, the PDP spokesman, Bankole Akinloye, said “We are, however, satisfied that Ogun workers are ready to take their destinies into their own very hands by confronting the hydra-headed monster planning to put their lives in abject jeopardy. “Like we have always held, any government that owes 21 months of salary deductions and eight years statutory leave allowances, has not only sent hardworking civil servants on a journey of no return, such government has also lost the essence and character of responsible and responsive government. Such monster has no business in government.”
