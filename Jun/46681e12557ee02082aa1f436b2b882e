A factional governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Segun Showunmi, has warned that the party may not produce a candidate in the 2023 gubernatorial poll. This followed the presentation of Certificate of Return to Hon Oladipupo Adebutu by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Presidential ticket: Only Buhari can ask me to step down &#8211; Yahaya Bello Presidential primary: Journalists denied access to venue as APC fails to release tags Both Showunmi and Adebutu are laying claims to the party’s ticket having emerged at parallel primaries held in Abeokuta, the state capital last month. However, Senator Iyorchia Ayu-led PDP leadership on Tuesday presented a certificate of return to Adebutu, thereby recognising him as the candidate of the party in the state. Showunmi described the presentation of the certificate of return as “lawless shenanigans.” He noted that with the ongoing legal battle over the disputed PDP ticket, the opposition party might experience what happened to the ruling APC in Rivers and Zamfara during the 2019 elections. He said, “On the so-called certificate issued on Ogun PDP governorship, despite the cases before the court on the Ogun PDP governorship primaries, they have gone on to purportedly issue a worthless piece of card to one of the contenders. “Please ask them what became of this type of lawless shenanigans. They tried it in 2011, they failed, in 2015 they failed, and in 2019 they failed. “It is too early to celebrate in 2023. Let us wait on the courts. This is not a lawless society, APC danced in Zamfara, They ended up with no candidate in Rivers, how much more with a location where they are looking for 100 per cent of zero.”
