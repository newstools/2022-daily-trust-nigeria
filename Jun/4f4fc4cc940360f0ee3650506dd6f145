The Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika has commissioned the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) pilot briefing room at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The briefing room is located near the tarmac where airlines’ pilots will receive daily weather briefings before they operate a flight. Commissioning the facility on Tuesday in Abuja, the Minister said the new facility will save pilots the stress of having to walk long distances to access NiMet’s weather briefings. He said: “Our operations are weather dependent. We have gained the capacity in Nigeria to give the most accurate weather for our operations. “Before now, pilots had to go through the trouble of walking distances and collecting the briefings from NiMet. But NiMet decided to bring the briefing room closer to the pilots in a more comfortable environment at the airport,” he stated. The minister also said the facility has state-of-the-art equipment to give the most accurate weather. This is part of the larger activities of NiMet in collaboration with other agencies. According to Sirika, NiMet will have an app where the pilots will access their briefings but “for now this briefing room will serve the pilots in a most efficient manner.” He said NiMet has the capability to replicate this facility across all the airports in Nigeria and they have already started. He noted that the management of NiMet has been innovative and has taken the initiative to improve safety of Nigeria’ airspace.
