The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has distributed start-up packs to ex-offenders that were trained on various trades while serving their jail terms. The trade tools distributed are for tailoring, barbing, carpentry, welding, hairdressing, masonry and laundry. Distributing the tools, the Comptroller General of NCoS, Haliru Nababa, expressed optimism that the skills acquired by the ex-offenders would usher them into a more qualitative phase of life. He said, “I wish to make a passionate appeal to members of the public to give these reformed Nigerians a chance by supporting and patronising them. “Stigmatisation of ex-offenders is a danger to us all as it will only send them back to criminal tendencies.” He thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for giving attention to the service and appreciated the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, for the exceptional support to the service.
