The National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) has received $46 million (N19.1 billion) from the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the European Union (EU) to improve training in the power sector. The Director-General of NPATIN, Ahmed Nagode, stated this on Wednesday during a workshop on “Enhancing Vocational Training Delivery for the Power Sector in Nigeria” in Abuja. Ekiti gov’ship: 11 candidates sign peace pact ‘Butane Energy offering stable LPG supply in Katsina’ Nagode, who was represented by the Director-Legal, and Head-Project Implementation at NAPTIN, Kunle Oyenusi, said raising human capacity in the sector was crucial. He said, “The AFD and the EU have provided $46m fund for three components; which are the product development, the training infrastructure and to build capacity for those that would man the infrastructure.” NAPTIN will construct a 104-bed hostel and four workshops at the institute’s headquarters in Abuja, as well as 1MVA 0.415/33KV, 1MVA 33/11KV and 1MVA 33/132KV substations, along with a Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) training pole yard as simulation points for training engineering graduates at its headquarters. On the institute’s impact in the sector, the NAPTIN boss said, “From 2009 when NAPTIN was created, we have had training for over 17,000 persons, with 14,000 in technical courses and 3,000 in non-technical programmes. This was done across our eight Regional Training Centres (RTC).” The AGM, Regulatory, Safety and Certification, Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Engr Bright Obidi, said enforcement of technical standards was quite imperative, requiring well-trained professionals to handle that. The Executive Director, Technical Services, Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Barka Sajou, said the agency had partnered with NAPTIN on building skills for solar installation and other renewable energy technologies.
