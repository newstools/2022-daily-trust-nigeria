The Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) has shortlisted 3,237 postgraduate candidates for the 2022 In-country Scholarship Scheme (ISS). Speaking yesterday during the commencement of the selection interview at its headquarters in Abuja, the Head of In-Country Scholarship Scheme at PTDF, Violet Ogbomo, said the fund picked 2,885 applicants for the Master of Science programme and 352 candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programme, selected from federal universities. The PTDF official said the weeklong interview was held in Abuja and five other locations simultaneously. “We have Bayero University Kano, University of Ibadan, University of Port Harcourt, University of Nigeria Nsukka and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi. These centres cover the six geopolitical zones, including the South East.” To ensure transparency during the interview, officials of the Federal Character Commission (FCC) were present across the centres to monitor the process until Saturday, June 18, 2022 when the exercise will end. She said, “Each day, we are expected to interview an average of 353 candidates per centre and candidates had the opportunity to pick any centre of their choice, and they also had the choice to pick the virtual interview option.” Ms Ogbomo also said from the 3,237 shortlisted candidates, the number to be picked for the scholarship will be determined by the management after appraising the interview. She also noted that the candidates were drawn from five fields of study, comprising engineering, geology, computing, environmental and management, adding, “We have experts in all these fields.” The official further charged the panellists, consisting of professors and senior lecturers, to treat every candidate with equality during the process.
