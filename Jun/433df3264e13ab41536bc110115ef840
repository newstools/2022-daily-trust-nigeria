People living with disabilities have called for inclusiveness in all spheres of life for them to have a sense of belonging. The call was made by Mrs Joy Bolarin, the Kwara Women Leader for Joint National Association of People with Disabilities (JONAPED) in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Ilorin on Monday. She said people with disabilities could use their talents to contribute meaningfully to the society, adding that “our disability doesn’t mean liability. “We can be what we want to be if given an enabling environment to thrive by using our talents to contribute meaningfully to the society. “The way we can be given a voice is through inclusiveness. Any activity or programme in the society, people with disabilities should be included,’’ she said. (NAN
