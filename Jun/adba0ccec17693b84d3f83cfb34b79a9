Alhaji Muhammadu Iliyasu-Bashar, Emir of Gwandu in Kebbi State, on Sunday sought for forgiveness from all, as he had forgiven all those who might have offended him knowingly or unknowingly. The Emir, who is the Chairman, Kebbi State Council of Chiefs, made the plea during a special prayer to mark his 17 years on throne at Abdullahi Fodio Palace in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the prayer session drew Islamic clerics from all sects across the state. The octogenarian said: “I want to appeal for forgiveness from all, whoever feels that I offended him/her should forgive me and whoever knew that I ‘ve done something good to him/her should give glory to God Almighty. I remember that was my last speech to Adamawa people while leaving there as military governor.”
