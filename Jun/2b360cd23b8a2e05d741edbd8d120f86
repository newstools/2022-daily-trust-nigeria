Governor Babagana Umara Zulum has urged his network of social media promoters to resist the temptation of responding to any of the spurious allegations coming from someone he described as an “Unknown governorship candidate (UGC) of the PDP in Borno State”. A statement issued in Maiduguri yesterday by Malam Isa Gusau, media strategist to Governor Zulum, said Mohammed Ali Jajari was not known even among the PDP stakeholders in Borno State. “We must not play into his kindergarten political playbook. Please ignore him. Do not ever mention his name. Avoid any debate, please. We must never be distracted, certainly not by an unknown governorship candidate,” the statement read. Reacting to the development, Abba Bukar Abba Masta of the Muhammad Mohammed Ali Jajari Campaign Organisation, in a statement, said: “The election day will be a day of reckoning for those who don’t know us. “So yes, accepted, I am an unknown governorship candidate, UGC. At the appropriate time, we will respond to some other things in the statement, if we find them worthwhile.”
