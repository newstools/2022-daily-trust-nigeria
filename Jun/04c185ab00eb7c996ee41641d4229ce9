The youth leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the six North Central states: Benue, Niger, Nasarawa, Plateau, Kogi and Kwara, including the FCT, have called on the leadership of the party to zone the vice presidency to the geo-political zone ahead of next year’s general elections. Speaking at a press briefing in Abuja, the APC Youth Leader in the FCT, Ibrahim Umar Faruq, said the nomination of an acceptable vice presidential candidate from the North Central would add electoral value to the party’s electoral fortunes at the general elections. According to him, while the APC youths are canvassing that the vice presidency be zoned to the North Central, they are equally appealing that it should be on the grounds of a Muslim/Christian ticket. He said, “By and large, we dare say that within the context of the ongoing permutations, and considering the strong support base of the APC in the region, where the party has produced five sitting governors, the North Central stands a favoured geo-political zone for the vice presidential slot.”
