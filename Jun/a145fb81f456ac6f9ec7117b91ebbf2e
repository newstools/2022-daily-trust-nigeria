Students of the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, Kwara State, have called on the management of the school to waive their carryovers. The students, on Tuesday, shut down the school’s gate and destroyed the windscreen of a principal officer’s car parked in the premises and threw sachet water at school officials who attempted to address them. The source said, “They broke the back windscreen of one of the principal officers’ official car and displayed placards with inscriptions: ‘One carryover must be waved’, ‘We are broke, we don’t have school fees’, among others.” City & Crime gathered that earlier, students in the hostels in main campus protested peacefully about the poor state of the hostels but the carryover students hijacked the protest and turned it violent. Speaking on the issue, the polytechnic’s spokesman, Mr Iroye Olayinka, said the decision not to wave any carryover this year was taken by the academic board and the “school said it would not rescind its decision on the matter. “What happened was that initially the school used to wave carryovers, but for obvious reasons, they decided against doing so this year as it appears it is making the students lazy. “That was what they were demonstrating against, and those who have not paid their school fees took the advantage to join the protest. “But everything has been resolved after the intervention of the Olofa of Offa, but the school said it would not rescind its decision on the matter.”
