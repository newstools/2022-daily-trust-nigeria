An area court sitting in Jos, Plateau State, has dissolved a 10-year-old marriage due to the husband’s inability to provide food and discharge other responsibilities to the family as reported by the wife, Zainab Abubakar. Zainab had approached the court seeking the dissolution of the marriage between her and her husband, Usain Abubakar, on the ground of his failure to provide the basic necessities in a marriage. She promised to refund the husband’s N20,000 dowry to obtain a divorce if he was not ready to divorce her, a prayer the court granted since it could not settle the matter. The Judge, Ghazali Adam, therefore, dissolved the marriage and asked Zainab to refund the dowry to her estranged husband, adding that the defendant should be paying N20,000 monthly to the plaintiff for the upkeep of their four-year old daughter.
