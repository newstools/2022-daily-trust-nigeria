The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) senatorial candidate for Imo East in the 2023 elections, Chyma Anthony, has asked the South East to reject the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) for refusing to zone their presidential tickets to the region. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Chyma said it was still possible for the South East to present itself as a formidable force in the Nigerian political landscape. He, therefore, said the region should unite under one party to elect members of federal parliament from the zone. He said that was the only way the zone would have a strong negotiating power. He also stressed that power will not be given to the zone on a platter hence the need for all political forces in the South East to come together and fight for a common interest.
