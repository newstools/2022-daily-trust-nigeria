A businessman, Mustapha Baba, on Wednesday prayed a Sharia Court in Kaduna State, to order his estranged wife, Amina Sani, to return a diamond necklace he gave her. Baba, who resides in Kaduna metropolis, through his counsel, Ahmad Ibrahim, told the court that he had many requests. Earlier, Sani’s wife said she was seeking divorce in order not to disobey God by not submitting to her husband. “I will not pay back the N50,000 he paid as my dowry to free myself from the marriage,” she said. Counsel to the complainant, MK Mustapha, prayed the court to adjourn the case to avail him the opportunity to investigate the matter and for possible out of court settlement between the parties. The judge, Malam Murtala Nasir, after listening to the parties said in Islamic law, if a wife requested the termination of a marriage, she is to pay back the amount of money paid as bride price. Nasir adjourned the case to March 22. (NAN)
