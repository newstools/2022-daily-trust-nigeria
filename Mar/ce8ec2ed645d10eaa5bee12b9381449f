The Group Managing Director and CEO of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPCL), Mallam Mele Kyari has said the company targets to be among the top five gas firms globally in the next 10 years. Kyari spoke at the ongoing Nigerian International Energy Summit (NIES) in Abuja on Wednesday. In his keynote address titled, ‘Changing Strategies for the Future of NNPC Ltd’, Kyari said: “We are building gas super-highways to connect gas sources to both existing and new markets. My vision is to see NNPC emerge as one of the Top 5 Gas companies within the next decade.” He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for birthing a new NNPC. “At the bedrock of the new NNPC is the creation of shared prosperity, partnerships that deliver energy to the people, enable progress, and uplift a larger segment of the society.” Kyari also said the growth of the gas business and low carbon intensive oil remains the focus. “We would invest in more oil and gas, however with increased efficiency in production, the investment in gas infrastructure to harness the gas resources both for domestic and export markets is already underway. “Our partnerships will be designed to innovate with advanced products, increase retail market footprints through strategic retail partnerships. NNPC will be a part of every home, workplace, and industry,” said Kyari. The NNPC helmsman further urged support from stakeholders. “We are open to scrutiny, as partners we would jointly evaluate the progress and reassess areas requiring change or improvement.”
