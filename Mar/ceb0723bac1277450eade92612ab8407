Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has created a directorate for politics and governance. The new directorate is expected to help mobilise support for members of the church who are into politics. Daily Trust reports that the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is a pastor in the church and is being touted as one of the front runners to replace President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. He has, however, not officially declared his intention to run for the highest office in the land. In the 2015 and 2019 elections, members of the church gave block votes to the All Progressives Congress (APC), most likely because of Osinbajo on the ticket of the party. The church boasts of millions of members across Nigeria. In the memo issued by the church on February 28 sighted online by our reporter on Thursday, the Assistant General Overseer (Admin and Personnel) of the church, Pastor J. F. Odesola, communicated the development to all pastors in charge of regions and provinces of the church. He said one Pastor Timothy Olaniyan has been appointed as the head of the newly created directorate. All the pastors in charge of regions and provinces of the church were by the memo directed to immediately appoint a provincial officer at all levels of the church (zone, area and parish). “The essence of this directorate is to help coordinate the engagement of our people who are willing to be involved in politics as well as mobilise support for them when required,” the memo read in part.
