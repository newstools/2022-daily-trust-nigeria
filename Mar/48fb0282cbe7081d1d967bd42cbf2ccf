The Plateau State government has reaffirmed its commitment to generating N5 billion monthly Internally Generated Revenue (IGSR). This was the submission of the Chairman of the Plateau State Internal Revenue Service (PSIRS) Service, Dashe Arlat, at an engagement with the private sector on the Plateau State Geographic and Information Service Law and the Land Use Charges Law. He said if anything related to Land Use Act is gotten correctly, every other thing would fall into place as land drives any other sector, and the needed IGR for the state would be actualized. The Commissioner, Ministry of Lands, Survey and Town Planning, Yakubu Dati, urged the business community to cooperate with the government through timely payment of their Property and Land Use charge. “It is imperative to state that the business community, especially the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, are close to the heart of the administration of this government. “This is evident in the 50% waiver granted by his excellency on all land-based transactions with the ministry since the inception of his administration,” the commissioner explained. He urged the business community to take advantage of these reliefs by cooperating with the government while saving huge resources through timely payment of their property and land use charges.
