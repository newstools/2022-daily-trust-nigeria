The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South East geo-political zone has aligned with the position of the Southern Governors’ Forum that the next president of Nigeria should come from the southern part of the country. The South-East zone of the PDP also directed that the existing zoning patterns in states and constituencies of the zone must be strictly adhered to in every state and constituency of the zone. Briefing newsmen after the Zonal Executive Committee (ZEC) meeting of the PDP held in Enugu, the National Vice Chairman (South-East), Chief Ali Odefa, disclosed that it was unanimously agreed the PDP should zone its apex ticket to the south. Meanwhile, some politicians who are aggrieved with the way their parties are being run, yesterday, launched a new political movement called the Nigeria Voters Assembly (NVA). Addressing a press conference in Abuja, Dr. Abdullahi Bello, who is the national secretary of the movement, said the group is bringing innovations to the electoral system. He said the movement is targeting 65 million Nigerians into its fold, adding that by the next elections, Nigerians are going to witness its impact on governance.
