Some stakeholders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) have opposed the choice of Senator Abdullahi Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari as national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). CPC is one of the legacy political parties that formed APC in July 2013. Others are Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a splinter group of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and another splinter group of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The stakeholders, under the Forum of Defunct CPC National Working and Executive Committees, said the party’s leadership position must be ceded to someone from the CPC block, who is a founding member of the APC. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the national secretary of the forum, Okoi Obono-Obla, lamented that internal bickering and factionalisation had cost the party electoral victories in the past because the party derailed from the dreams of its founding fathers due to leadership failure. The former chairman of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel on Recovery of Public Property (SPIP) said the former Nasarawa State governor, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, has the qualities to save the party from electoral misfortunes.
