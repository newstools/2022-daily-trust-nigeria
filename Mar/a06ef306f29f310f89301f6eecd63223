 The Nigeria Customs Service, on Monday, granted importers one month’s grace to enable them to clear the backlog of trapped vehicles at ports in Lagos. Importers had said vehicles trapped as a result of the implementation of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation system now run to over N650 million. The importers said over 13,000 vehicles are trapped at the seaports and different terminals in Lagos. The public relations officer of the Tin-Can Island chapter of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Clearing Agents (ANLCA), Onome Monije, said the decision to grant one-month grace was reached at a stakeholders’ town hall meeting. “This will give little respite to importers whose vehicles are trapped. It is indeed a welcome development,” she added. Uche Ejisieme, public relations officer, Tin-Can Island Command, said due to the public outcry that greeted the VIN implementation, the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, retired Col. Handed Ali, has graciously granted one month’s grace to enable importers and freight forwarders to clear their backlog of trapped vehicles. Ejisieme said following a meeting with the agents, the CGC gave the one-month window to enable the clearing of the backlog of vehicles in the ports. “You are requested to note that the VIN valuation protocol is still in operation as reviews and updates are being captured in our systems to reflect these adjustments. “Customs Area controllers have been directed to monitor the transition period and ensure manual assessments are in full compliance with extant laws. Also note that the grace period is effective tomorrow March 8, 2022,” said the CGC.
