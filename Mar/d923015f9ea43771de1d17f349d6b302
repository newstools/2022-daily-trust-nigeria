A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Muhammad Hayatu-Deen, has picked his nomination and expression of interest forms to contest for the presidency, adding that he did not care which zone or tribe produced the president. Speaking after purchasing the form at the headquarters of the PDP, Hayatu-Deen declared that he was a different kind of politician who did not care where the president comes from as far as he had the requisite qualifications to turn things around for the country. The technocrat-turned-politician said, “I am not your classic politician, I am a technocrat. All my life I have gotten things done. I have worked in major institutions as chief executive officer and I understand quite a few issues. “I understand why certain nations succeed and why some fail; I understand what it takes for nation-state to be great, successful. “Human organisations are all the same, you just need to adopt. Nigeria today is in very serious trouble. I know what it takes to put people to deliver on the mandate of the Nigerian people; people with integrity.” The presidential aspirant, who said he had worked with three presidents, added that “as an economist and having gotten experience in dealing with issues, I think I have an understanding of what to do to settle the Nigerian issue. “I have been a presidential adviser to three presidents; I was chairman of a committee on the economy during the Buhari transition and we put in a beautiful report on finance and economy.”
