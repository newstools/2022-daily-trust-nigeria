The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has warned members of the public to be wary of the presence of burnt canned foods in Lagos markets. It said there are strong indications that some urchins as well as traders might start the re-distribution of burnt canned food stolen during the fire outbreak at Apongbon, Lagos Island, to other markets in the state. An early morning fire on Wednesday razed down some shops at Apongbon market, causing traffic gridlock in the area. Goods, including canned foods worth millions of naira, were destroyed by the fire which started from a shop located under the Apongbon bridge. Street urchins also known as “Area Boys” besieged scene and carted away some canned foods in the process. Some of the urchins hiding under the guise of helping shop owners, allegedly carted away several goods from affected shops. Some of the goods include canned tomato paste, butter, canned drinks and canned fish. The Head, Lagos Territorial Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Ibrahim Farinloye warned members of the public that some canned products already burnt in the fire might be put on sales by unscrupulous traders. He said, “The public is hereby urged to be wary of tomatoes paste, margarine and sardines when purchasing such products. “The public are to be informed that some canned products already burnt in the current fire outbreak may be put on sales by unscrupulous traders. “The public is hereby urged to be wary of tomatoes paste, margarine and sardines when purchasing such products.”
