Former governor of Kano state, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has said he is set to dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP). Daily Trust had reported how Kwankwaso held talks with the leadership of NNPP a few days ago. In an interview with BBC Hausa, Kwankwaso said preparations were in top gear and he would announce his next step of action before the end of March. Although he did not give elaborate details and reasons for choosing NNPP, recently Kwankwaso said the two leading parties (APC and PDP), have nothing to offer Nigerians in 2023. “I didn’t see anything that either APC or PDP will show or tell Nigerians to get convinced and vote for them in the coming 2023 elections.” “So I think people should now come to think of the right party and people to support and vote for so that we can rescue the present situation. “In 2015, we gave the leadership of the state to some, thinking that they will make it, but not knowing that it won’t yield any positive outcome. That is why we are back to rescue our state,” Kwankwaso had said. Also speaking to the BBC Hausa service, an associate of the former governor, said poor handling of the leadership crisis in Kano PDP forced Kwankwaso to exit the party. Last month, Kwankwaso had joined forces with some of his associates to launch a new movement ‘The National Movement, TNM’.
