Africa’s leading e-commerce builder, StartWeb, has partnered with Haptics Academy, a training and technology solutions organisation and a ‘Grow with Google partner, to facilitate a free training program specifically designed for African entrepreneurs and small business owners. A statement by IDAfrica said the goal is to tutor over 1,000 business owners to expand their operations and upgrade their skills in a rapidly evolving world. With SMEs providing an estimated 80% of jobs across the continent, the partnership is seeking to empower young Africans with employable skills by providing a world-class mentorship programme that will equip the next generation of budding entrepreneurs with new skills. The modules revolve around Google Workspace tools, Google My Business and teaching the participants to build their websites, e-commerce online store, and the tools required to manage multiple resources. Participants will also receive a Basic Digital Skills Certificate, sponsored by Google and StartWeb, upon completion. StartWeb Co-founder, Kelvin Orifa said, “This training will allow young African entrepreneurs to compete more favourably within the global market.” Nwaokolo Ngozi, Project Manager of Haptics Academy added, “We are glad to find the right avenue to assist African business owners as part of the ‘Grow with Google’ initiative. It is in line with our mission to inspire a new generation of sustainable, global African businesses and create a community of world-class African technology professionals.” Marvelous Chiamaka Friday, StartWeb’s Product Lead, also shared her thoughts on the training program and partnership, “We are partnering with Google to boost the African business community by teaching young Africans to optimize their business processes without breaking the bank.’’
