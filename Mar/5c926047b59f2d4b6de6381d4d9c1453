The rematch between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk will take place in Saudi Arabia in June, according to MailOnline. In September, Usyk defeated Joshua in a bout and took his heavyweight titles. Hopes of the former cruiserweight reclaiming his titles were almost dashed after Usyk returned to Ukraine, his country, to join the fight against Russia. Usyk had said, “I really don’t know when I’m going to be stepping back in the ring. My country and my honour are more important to me than a championship belt.” But Saudi Arabia has now forked out a reported £90million to host the rematch with June 25 being the frontrunner date. The price tag for the fight is a third more than the £60million Saudi paid for Joshua’s rematch with Andy Ruiz in 2019.
