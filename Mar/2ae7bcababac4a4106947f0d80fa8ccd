A 40-year-old man, Musa Godwin, was on Wednesday brought before a high court in Kaduna State for defrauding job seekers of N22 million. Godwin was charged with obtaining money by false pretense and fraud by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC counsel, Precious Onyeneho, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between July and November, 2020. Onyeneho informed the court that the defendant, with the intent to defraud, obtained N22m from 25 five job seekers with a promise to get them employed. Godwin, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Following the plea, the prosecution, urged the court to remand the defendant and fix a date for trial. But the defence counsel, Charles Francis, prayed the court to grant the defendant bail pending the hearing and determination of the case. Justice Darius Khobo admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N5m and one surety in like sum and adjourned the case to May 24. (NAN)
