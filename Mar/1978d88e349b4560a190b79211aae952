An All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairmanship aspirant, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has said he will strengthen the party and move it closer to the people if elected as chairman on Saturday. He disclosed this when he met members of the APC Caucus of the House of Representatives on Tuesday. He said he would see that the APC is strengthened to function as the leading party as it ought to be by carrying all its members along as the foremost party in the Nigerian democratic space. “The kind of leadership I will bring is that which those that run the affairs of the party should be seen to be very useful to everyone. “They will be busy 24/7, 365 days and not only when we have conventions or congresses. “It would even reduce the burden of leadership because if the majority are well-educated and enlightened with the programmes and activities of the governing party, I don’t see how any other party would have a space,” he said. Earlier, the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa and other members assured the aspirant that they are also for the development of the party, adding that they shared the same view with the senator.
