 The National Chairman of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has declared his intention to contest for the presidency come 2023. Sowore said he would run a socialist government focusing on workers’ welfare, free education, job creation, and pension reform. He made this known on Tuesday in Abuja while declaring his ambition to run for Nigeria’s presidency in the 2023 general elections. According to him “Nigerian workers; a living wage is coming your way. What I am saying to you is that an N100,000 monthly minimum wage is too small for Nigerian workers today. “Last time we promised N100,000 as a minimum wage but they were telling us that it would cause inflation but senators are collecting N14 million per month it did not cause inflation.” He also vowed to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and a Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho) from detention if he becomes the President of Nigeria in 2023.
