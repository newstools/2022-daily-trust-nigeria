The new Director of the FCT Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS), aka VIO, Dr Abdulateef Bello, has said all the 1,500 impounded motorcycles in the territory would soon be crushed. The motorcycles, which were used for commercial purposes, were impounded by the DRTS from riders who violated traffic rules and regulations in the nation’s capital.

They are motorcycles that were arrested contravening the law and regulations, driving against the traffic within the Federal Capital City (FCC). “Right now we have over 1200 waiting to be crushed. As much as the exercise is ongoing, we are calculating by our estimation when we have one 1,500, then we begin another second round of the crushing. “These motorcycles were impounded within three to four months, we did the last exercise around November/December, then we started assembling the newly impounded motorcycles.” He warned okada riders to obey the rules, adding that the order did not apply the FCT routes alone. He advised the operators to always stay within areas such as estates and market places, and stay off the highways. He said all those that contravene the order will face the punishment of having their bikes crushed.
