Malam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. (NNPC), says no national oil company in the world is as transparent as NNPC. He said this in reaction to the summons by the  House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts. The committee had directed Heads of NNPC subsidiaries to appear before it. Kyari, in a statement on Tuesday, said NNPC would comply with the committee’s requirement, and continue to be accountable and transparent. “We have nothing to hide, Mr Chairman. We recognise that this company belongs to over 200 million Nigerians as its shareholders, thus we have been accountable and transparent and we will continue to remain so.” “No national oil company in the world is as transparent as we are. We shall comply with the House Committee’s requirement,” Mallam Kayari stated. The committee had on March 16, through a letter signed by its Chairman, Oluwole Oke (PDP: Osun), summoned the 17 subsidiaries of NNPC to respond to audit queries by the Audito- General for the Federation over the operations of their finances between 2014 and 2019.
