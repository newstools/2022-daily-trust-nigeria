The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, on Tuesday met with the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, at the Jericho, Ibadan home of the Alaafin. Daily Trust reports that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Aregbesola had disagreed over the second term ambition of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State, with Aregbesola vowing to stop his predecessor from getting a second term ticket. The meeting, according to a source, was not unconnected with the crisis between the APC leaders. Daily Trust learnt that the meeting, which started around 10am on Tuesday, was convened to resolve the crisis. Confirming the meeting to reporters on phone on Tuesday, the Media Adviser to the Minister of Interior, Mr Sola Fasure, said Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, held a private meeting with Aregbesola on Tuesday. He said, “It is true that Aregbesola held a meeting with the Ooni of Ife and Alaafin today in Ibadan. It was a private meeting and I was not there so I don’t know what they discussed. Meanwhile, the League of South West Civil Society and Community Based Organisations yesterday advocated reconciliation between Tinubu and Aregbesola. The coalition of civil society organisations stated that there is no dispute that cannot be settled and urged those fuelling the crisis to stop what they called “unwarranted attacks” on Aregbesola but rather toe the path of peace and reconciliation. At a press conference in Lagos, the spokesman for the league, Taiwo Adeleye, stated that the attacks on the minister are unnecessary and must stop.
