A coalition of youth organisations in the North Central geo-political zone on Thursday said over 65 per cent of Nigerian youths have been excluded from the nation’s political process. They said this in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, while calling on a member of the House of Representatives representing Iseyin/Iwajowa/Kajola/Itesiwaju federal constituency of Oyo State, Shina Abiola Peller, to contest the 2023 presidential election. Addressing journalists, the convener of the coalition, Ambassador Moses Adeyefa, flanked by other members of the group, said the time is right for a youth president in the country. “Those who have contributed more in building this country were youths at the prime age of 30 and 45 years. “These include leaders like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Tafawa Balewa, Obafemi Awolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Anthony Enahoro among others, who were all youths when they fought for our independence and laid the foundation for modern Nigeria. “During the era of youth dominance in leadership in Nigeria, the country saw massive growth and development in all regions and strata of life. “Youthful age is indeed the productive age, while old age is for compliments and relaxation. This is the law of nature that most African leaders try to break, especially in Nigeria,” they said.
