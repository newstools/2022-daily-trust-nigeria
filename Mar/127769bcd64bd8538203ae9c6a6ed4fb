The Nigeria Customs Service, on Monday, backtracked from its previous decision to continue with the implementation of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation system, as it has called for an all-encompassing stakeholders engagement. The meeting which is expected to hold today at the Nigeria Customs Training School, Ikeja, is meant to iron out among other things all gray areas identified in the VIN valuation. Freight forwarders had penultimate Monday staged a protest against the implementation of VIN. At the weekend, both the Motor Dealers Association of Nigeria (MODAN) and Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) threatened to join the protest if the service refused to halt implementation. A notice issued by the service National Public Relations Officer, Deputy Comptroller of Customs (DC) Timi Bomodi, revealed that the meeting would deliberate on the recently introduced VIN-Valuation System and the challenges being experienced by stakeholders.
