 A group of Zamfara State indigenes on Tuesday purchased the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nomination and expression of interest form for Malam Abubakar Gusau to contest the state governorship election in 2023. The indigenes, under the aegis of Zamfara Rescue Initiative, a movement comprising of top business leaders, youth leaders, Zamfara indigenes abroad, friends and well-wishers of the state, said they want a credible and purpose-driven personality in the person of Gusau to lead the state. Speaking while receiving the forms, Gusau commended the initiative, describing the gesture as a challenge and clarion call to serve his people. The Coordinator of Zamfara Rescue Initiative, Musa Bello, while presenting the forms to Gusau in Abuja, said they purchased them with the sole aim of rescuing the state from underdevelopment.
