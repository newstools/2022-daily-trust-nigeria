We have come to realise that we are all capable, competent and fit to lead this country. At the end of the day, it is only one person that will lead this country in 2023. “So we resolved that we are going to work closely together to ensure that we come up with a consensus arrangement. We believe our role is to make things easier for us; to have stability because if there is stability in PDP, there will be stability in Nigeria. “We have all seen that APC is no longer a party; it is having challenges of administering its affairs. Anybody that cannot administer right cannot administer the country, so the only option for Nigerians is PDP. “We believe because of that level of responsibility, we must bury our personal ambition. We believe that if the three of us – that, is myself, Governor Tambuwal and Governor Mohammed – are working together harmoniously, committed and with a lot of energy, there will be great hope for this country going ahead. “The unity of the country, the stability of the country and the growth of the country is more important than individual ambitions, hence the need for us to work together,” Saraki said.
