Governor of Nasarawa Sate and chairman of the publicity sub-committee for the national convention of the APC, Abdullahi Sule, has said President Muhammadu Buhari and governors on the platform of the party opted for consensus to have a peaceful exercise on Saturday. President Buhari had met with APC governors at the state house, Abuja, on Wednesday, where they agreed on consensus. Addressing newsmen at the party’s national secretariat on Thursday in Abuja, Gov Sule said the APC governors were now more united and would go into the convention as one united family. He said the number of delegates had not been ascertained yet, adding that the number would be determined after accreditation. The governor said, “As I mentioned earlier, we have been driven towards a consensus arrangement so that we can have a very peaceful convention after which most of the political activities will begin which will lead into the success of the party at most of the elections that we are going to have next year by the grace of God. “We also look forward actually to a convention that is going to signify our unity and our strength as we come together to face the election next year. So I thank you sincerely for coming. That is why we have come here to be able to discuss these issues with you.” Meanwhile, Coalition of the All Progressives Congress Party Support Groups (CAPCSG) has commended President Buhari, saying his intervention for a successful national convention of the party on Saturday was timely. Addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, the secretary general of the coalition, Mr Shedrack Ogolekwu, called on members of the APC and supporters to remain committed to the party’s ideology to enable its leadership achieve its mandate.
