Rev. Tajan Moltok, the Resident Pastor of Shepherd House Assembly International, Jos, has underscored the need for good personal hygiene to enable women to save their marriages. The cleric gave the advice during the church’s women’s convention on Sunday in Jos with the theme ‘The intentional woman’. He said good hygiene should be practised by women, keep themselves neat, dress smartly and keep their marital homes tidy. “An intentional woman should keep herself and her family clean. “Some women complain that their husbands do not find them appealing. One of the reasons is that they are dirty,” he said.
