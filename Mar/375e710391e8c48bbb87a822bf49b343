The Adamawa State Government on Tuesday launched Sexual Offenders Database (SOD) to ensure quick dispensation of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) cases in the state. Speaking during the event in Yola, Justice Afraimu Jingi, Attorney-General and commissioner for Justice in the state, said the database would help to give information about the number of times sexual offenders commit the crime. According to him, with the database in place, there will be no hiding place for offenders as it is linked to the national register and can be accessed by all Nigerians so that offenders can be named and shamed.
