A group known as South East for Tinubu (SET), has said the former governor of Lagos State, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, will enjoy massive support in the South East and South South during the 2023 presidential election. The convener of the group, Nwosu Emmanuel, said SET is already mobilizing massively for Tinubu’s presidential election come 2023, through public enlightenment and persuasion to ensure that he wins the hearts of the South East and South South voters. “In the South East and South South, Tinubu will get much more vote in the 2023 presidential election than any other candidate that has contested in the recent times. This is because he has paid his dues in the politics of this great nation, Nigeria. “There is no politician in this country that has recorded a feat that Tinubu recorded in politics. He is a builder of men and resources. In Lagos, he laid a master plan, midwifed and engineered it, and Lagos becomes what it is today. “Instead of agitations, the South East should start now to negotiate, build friendship and alliances in order to grab future opportunities,” he said.
