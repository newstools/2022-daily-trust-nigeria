 President Muhammadu Buhari, would today embark on an inspection tour of the Lekki Deep Seaport, ahead of the August takeoff date. Buhari is expected to ascertain the extent of work done so far and to also ensure that the promoters deliver the project in target time. He will also inspect the quayside, accommodation for government agencies, among others. Stakeholders also expect a statement on whether the port will be linked by rail to avoid similar congestion issues witnessed around the Apapa Port. The Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, during a similar visit, pushed for an early completion date for the Lekki Deep Seaport project to enable the government to approve all necessary processes before the next general elections. The minister acknowledged that it was about 80 per cent complete and has before the end of this year as the target for completion of construction. Also, Cai Pingzhen, the Chief Finance Officer of Lekki Port LFTZ, recently said the port will commence operations this year. “It is on track for completion in 2022, and operations will also commence in 2022,” he said. Pingzhen noted that the port project is fully funded with the infusion of $221,047,248 equity from China Harbour Engineering Company (CHE) and the $629 million loan by China Development Bank.
