Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi, who represented Kaduna North Senatorial District during the last assembly, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Hunkuyi, who went to the parliament on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defected to the PDP shortly before the 2019 general elections. In a letter to his ward chairman in Kudan LGA, dated February 25, he said he had withdrawn his membership of the PDP. He, however, did not disclose his next line of action but Daily Trust reports that he is set to join New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Secretary of PDP in Kaduna Ibrahim Wosono confirmed to Daily Trust that the party had received the senator’s letter. “Yes, we confirmed from his ward that they have received his letter. So, we wish him well because it is not the first time he is leaving our party. His exit this time will not affect the party in any way,” he said.
