The national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has slated the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Tuesday, March 15. Although the agenda was not made known in the notice of the meeting, sources close to the party said some of the issues slated for discussion are the zoning formula of the party and the just concluded Osun primaries. There has been tension in the leading opposition party as its stalwarts and aspirants struggled to get the party’s presidential ticket zoned in their favour. At the moment, leading aspirants of the party are from the northern part of the country, including former vice president Atiku Abubakar, former Senate president, Bukola Saraki, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State and his Bauchi counterpart, Bala Mohammed. From the South East, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, has shown interest to contest the ticket. A statement on Thursday signed by the PDP National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, said the meeting will start at 2pm at the PDP national secretariat, Abuja. On the just concluded party primaries in Osun, two candidates emerged – Senator Ademola Adeleke and a parallel primary by the Wale Ojo-led executive which produced Dotun Babayemi as their candidate.
