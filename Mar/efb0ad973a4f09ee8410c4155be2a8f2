Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, says he has not resigned. There are reports that Senator Akpanudoedehe had resigned following the developments in the party. But addressing newsmen at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja on Tuesday, he said he is still the authentic secretary of the party’s Caretaker Committee. “I have read in social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true; that I didn’t resign. If I have resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead when he is alive. “I am not bigger than the party, or bigger than the President who is a leader of the country. I am waiting for the national chairman to come back,” he said.
