An online marketplace for made-in-Africa children and maternity care products, ChildAfrique, has vowed to promote African products to the global market. The founder and CEO of the company, Aronke Feyi-Emmanuel said ChildAfrique is different from other online shopping platforms as it is streamlined to provide locally made essentials for women and children. “ChildAfrique comes for only child and maternity care products. We have even further narrowed it down to items that are made within African nations. Not just Nigeria, we have vendors and partners from Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and South Africa that are coming to list their products on ChildAfrique. We have over 47 vendors who are of Nigerian origin and more than 260 locally made child care products on display,” she said. She stressed that the aim of the online platform is to encourage Africans, especially Nigerians to patronise locally made products for maternity and child care. President of the Association of African Startups and the African Government Shareholders Engagement Forum, Just Ibe, stated that the online shopping platform will create more jobs, foreign exchange, strengthen the economy as well as amplify the African brand.
