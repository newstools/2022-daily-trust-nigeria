An advocacy group, Abuja Grassroots Advocacy Projects (AGAP), has berated APC senators at the National Assembly over their failure to support mayoral status for the FCT. City & Crime reports that the senators had voted against a bill for an act to alter the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to provide for the office of Mayor for the Federal Capital Territory Administration and other related matters. The chief advocate of the group, Comrade Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf, in a press briefing, also threatened that if the senators continue to ignore sensitive matters that have a direct bearing on the plight of FCT indigenes, the indigenous people of FCT might be pushed to boycott the 2023 general elections. He, however, commended the senator representing the FCT at the National Assembly for his courage and “high standard of lobbying” his colleagues to support the Mayoral Bill in favour of FCT natives. He also commended the effort and doggedness of the principal officers of the House of Representatives, Sokodobo, Jiba, and Gbefwi for standing by the FCT people to ensure that the bill scaled through in favour of FCT indigenes at the lower chamber. He further called on Nigerians to question the rationale behind the negative motives of the senators over the mayoral status of the FCT, regretting the support the indigenous people of FCT gave to the APC to win two-third of the votes in 2016 and 2019 to clinch the seat of presidency.
