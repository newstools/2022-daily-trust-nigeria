A socio-cultural group, the Arewa Initiative for Peaceful Coexistence in Southern Nigeria, has supported calls that President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor should come from the southern part of the country. The national chairman of the group, Alhaji Musa Saidu who spoke with our reporter in Port Harcourt, said equity demands that the next president of the country should come from southern part of the country. He said given the political permutations of the entire southern Nigeria, the South West has the voting bloc and stands a better chance to produce the nation’s next president.
