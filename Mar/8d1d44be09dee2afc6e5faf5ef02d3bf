The Fusion and Transition Council of the Third Force Mega Party initiated by the National Consultative Front, NCFront, yesterday cleared the air that the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) is not the adopted mega party. Daily Trust reports that former Kano Governor, Alhaji Rabiu Musa  Kwankwaso had adopted the NNPP. In a statement last night, the NCFront said it was compelled to clear the air “about some mischievous and misleading reports currently generating erroneous impression and confusion in the public space; among our teeming members, supporters and followers as regards the status of our much awaited Third Force Mega Party initiated in July, 2021 with the aim of rescuing Nigeria from the crisis ridden ruling parties in Nigeria.” The group explained that its Fusion and Alliance talks towards the unveiling of the Third Force Alternative Party, was finally consummated last week, saying the Third Force Mega platform would be unveiled by the end of the month. “To this end and against the backdrop of erroneous reports in the press and social media, we wish to clarify that the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, recently adopted by Former Governor Rabiu Musa Kwakwanso and his associates in The National Movement, TNM, is not the same as our much awaited Third Force Mega Party,” the statement reads. The group explained that key leaders involved in the “coalescing process” include Prof Pat Utomi, Prof Attahiru Jega, Hon. Dr Usman Bugaje, Senator Saidu Dansadau, Prof Kingsley Moghalu, Mallam Falalu Bello, Chief Raph Okey Nwosu, Dr Tanko Yunusa, Comrade Promise Adewusi, Prof Remi Sonaiya, eminent leaders of the Nigerian civil society and labour movements, among other political icons and party leaders in Nigeria and in diaspora.
