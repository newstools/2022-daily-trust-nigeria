The president of the Grade A Customary Court sitting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, R. Gbadamosi, on Wednesday adjourned the suit between Dr Bilikis Babarinde and her husband, Prof. Sikiru Adekola, to April 11 for hearing. Bilikis had approached the court to dissolve her 20-year-old marriage with her husband over maltreatment and promiscuity. Dr Babarinde who is with the university’s Faculty of Education, told the court that the marriage had broken down irretrievably. She said the marriage was contracted on March 2, 2002 and had produced three children. The plaintiff urged the court to restrain Prof. Adekola from harassing, molesting and intimidating her and also to grant her the custody of the three children. She also urged the court to order Prof. Adekola to bear full responsibility for the payment of school fees, books, feeding and medical expenses of the children. Dr Babarinde also urged the court to order Prof. Adekola to pay N100,000 monthly for feeding the children and N120,000, also monthly as their wardrobe allowance. At Wednesday’s proceeding, Prof. Adekola told the court that he was not opposed to the dissolution of the marriage. Prof. Adekola who is with the Faculty of Education, also at the University of Ibadan, spoke through his counsel, Yusuf Anikulapo. Mr Anikulapo told the court,  that he had filed an application challenging the jurisdiction of the court. Objecting to the move, Olufemi Adegboroye, counsel to Dr Babarinde, said Prof. Adekola raised some new points in his counter-affidavit that were not in the originating summons. He told the court that he was just served with the counter-affidavit and required time to respond to it and subsequently asked the court for an adjournment.
