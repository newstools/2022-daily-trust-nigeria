The National President of the Nigeria Institute of Town Planners, TPL Olutoye Ayinde, has attributed the haphazard development of towns, cities and neighbourhoods in the country to the absence of policy and vision by government. Olutoye, who addressed journalists in Abuja as part of his official visit to the nation’s capital, said until those in authority provided relevant policies on physical planning and their execution, people would continue to seek self-help. He said that is what is leading to confusion and haphazard development of the country’s cities, towns and neighbourhoods. He stressed the need for physical planning in city development, adding that planning flows from policy and policy expresses vision, without which the country would stagnate. He also attributed the frequent flooding in the country to poor planning emanating from lack of relevant policies in the country. Olutoye said he had visited 20 states before coming to the FCT, adding that the visit is aimed at reminding those in authority of the need for good physical planning.
