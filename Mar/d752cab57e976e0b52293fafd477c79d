Despite the peaceful conduct of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) congress in Lagos, where a new executive emerged last Sunday, all is still not well with the party in the state, Daily Trust can report. Aggrieved members have now tabled their grievances before the party’s appeal committee, which is expected to sit in Abuja next Tuesday, it was learnt. Daily Trust had earlier reported how delegates rejected the consensus option earlier adopted by the party hierarchy, which would have seen to the emergence of Dr. Amos Fawole as the chairman. However, in a move to call the bluff of party leaders who sat with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to draw up a “unity list”, the delegates rejected the consensus and instead elected a new set of executive members. This saw the emergence of a former commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Tourism in the state, Mr Philip Aivoji, as the newly-elected chairman. Aivoji is believed to have the strong backing of the immediate past chairman, Mr. Deji Doherty and some PDP House of Representatives members in the state, who rebelled against the candidates endorsed by the board of trustees members in the state. Our correspondent learnt yesterday that there were strong moves to modify the list of elected members to include some chieftains contained in the other list which was totally rejected by the party. A member of the newly elected state working committee, who spoke with our correspondent in confidence yesterday, said the congress was conducted peacefully and the election was won and lost fairly. The newly-elected publicity secretary, Alhaji Hakeem Amode, in a chat with Daily Trust, said there was no harmonisation anywhere since the election had been won. He added that four out of the five Board of Trustees (BOT) members participated in the election. He however said members of the party would reconcile towards forming a formidable opposition against the ruling party.
