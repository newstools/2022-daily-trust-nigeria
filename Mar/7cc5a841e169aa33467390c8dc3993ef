 The Chairman House of Representatives Committee on Youths, Adeyemi Adaramodu, has told Nigerian youths not to expect to win elections because the Not Too Young To Run Act has been signed into law. at the Policy Dialogue on Not Too Young To Run Act and the Manifestos of Political Parties organized by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), in collaboration with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adaramodu said the engagement was good for the youths and Nigeria but added that a law is as good as how it is put into practice. He said the youths must be ready to learn the ropes, be mentored as a way towards gaining political power. In her submission, the Director of Programmes, YIAGA Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, enumerated some of the challenges faced by youths in trying to access political positions, saying some of the political parties have put in place structures that do not favour the youth. She said the selection process put in place by political parties prevents youths from winning primaries, adding that parties need to know the constraints of the young and how to engage them and give them the opportunity to win elections.
