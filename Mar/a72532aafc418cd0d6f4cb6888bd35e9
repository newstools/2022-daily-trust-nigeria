Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a coalition of pressure groups under the auspices of Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi 2023 Team (CRA) on Sunday in Abuja, offered prayers for the peaceful conduct of the election and co-existence of Nigerians. Addressing newsmen shortly after its maiden prayer session titled ‘Unity and Peaceful Coexistence in Nigeria’, the national coordinator of the team, Chief Chinedu Mbanaeso, urged the Minister of Transport and former governor of Rivers State, Chief Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, to formally declare for the 2023 presidency.

Mbaneso, who noted the potency of prayer in all human endeavours, said his group decided to start with prayers first because it believed that nothing can be achieved without God’s approval. He said, “Amaechi’s transformation in the transport and marine sector, especially the railways has proven that he has the right credentials to govern the country. “He has the cognitive experience having been a speaker, governor and minister. He is capable, detribalized and age is on his side.”
