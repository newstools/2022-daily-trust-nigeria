Supporters of the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, on Wednesday disclosed that they have raised N67 million for the apex bank boss. The fund, according to them, was for the purchase of his All Progressives Congress (APC) Expression of Interest and Presidential Nomination Form. The supporters, under the aegis of Emefiele Support Group (ESG), at a press briefing in Abuja, also said they were targeting N100m before the end of next week. Although Emefiele, an indigene of Ika in Agbor, Delta State, the Igbo-speaking part, is yet to formally declare his intention to run for the seat, his supporters maintain that his participation would douse tension and agitation in the South East. Addressing journalists at the briefing, the ESG Director of Communications, Ms Benigna Ejimba, stressed that members of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) are expected to contribute N25,000 each. Ejimba added that all importers and other Nigerians who have benefitted from the CBN’s initiatives and interventions under the leadership of Emefiele are also expected to make the freewill donations. Meanwhile, members of the presidential campaign team of Emefiele under the aegis of Unified Northern Forum For Meffy 2023, were yesterday in Kebbi State. The director general of the group, Dr. Ibrahim Bature, said they were in Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State capital, as part of their campaign for the CBN governor across the country.
