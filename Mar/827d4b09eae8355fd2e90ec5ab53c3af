The Presidency, on Tuesday, said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would “die” as envisaged by one of its presidential aspirants if its only wish for the country was an agitation worse than EndSARS because of the current situation. The Senior Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement titled ‘Destabilization: PDP Gives Itself Away’, urged the party to rather work for harmony and cohesion in the country instead of thinking about the outbreak of an uprising worse than EndSARS which, he said, signified murder, mayhem, mass destruction and cannibalism. He said PDP had given itself away as being interested only in the destabilisation of the country to sneak its way back to power. Adesina said: “Less than 24 hours after the Department of State Services (DSS) raised alarm about sinister plots by some elements to cause disorder in the land, using the energy crisis as a smokescreen, the PDP issued a statement, saying; ‘Our party fears that the situation is getting to a boiling point and can trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 EndSARS if not addressed immediately.’ “Rather than plot and encourage “agitation worse than October 2020 EndSARS,” which it may well be conceiving, the PDP should work for harmony and cohesion in the country, if it ever understands such concept. “EndSARS signified murder, mayhem, mass destruction, even cannibalism. PDP now wishes Nigeria something worse.” The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, had in a statement issued on Sunday, warned that there was a limit to what the people could bear under an administration that remained arrogant, inhumane, unconcerned and insensitive to their plights occasioned by its misrule.
