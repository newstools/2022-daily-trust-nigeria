Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the list of new voters to registered political parties. The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this on Tuesday in Abuja at the end of the commission’s management meeting. He said Section 10(3) of the Electoral Act 2022 states that “the Commission shall, within 60 days after each year, make available to every political party the names and addresses of each person registered during that year.” He said in compliance with the requirement of the law, the commission on Tuesday made available the softcopies of the list of persons registered as voters in 2021 to each political party. On the implementation of the 2023 General Election Timetable, Okoye said the commission has now implemented the second activity on the timetable for the 2023 elections released three days ago, February 26. He said the first activity was the publication of the Notice of Election yesterday, February 28.
