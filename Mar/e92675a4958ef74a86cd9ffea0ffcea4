A foremost economist and banker, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has announced his intention to run for the presidency in 2023. Hayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director and chief executive of FSB International Bank, declared his intention on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, while addressing thousands of his supporters from all walks of life in Lagos. He will be contesting the PDP ticket with other aspirants who have so far indicated interest in the coveted position. The technocrat said he is on a journey to create the conditions for national rebirth by re-igniting the boundless energy, imagination and creativity of the Nigerian people. Addressing an audience of Nigerians from all walks of life, Hayatu-Deen said the country needs an unusual kind of leader who is fully equipped with the type of skills, character and experience to safely navigate the people out of stormy waters to a much brighter and better place reflective of the nation’s rich potentials for greatness. The former banker said his choice for the PDP is because it is one of two major political parties in the country and it has a national outlook. On zoning and power shift, the presidential aspirant said, “Nigeria didn’t hold a referendum in 1999 when it was decided by a particular party to concede the leadership of the executive to the southern part of the country. “Zoning is the exclusive preserve of the party leadership in terms of what is it that they want to do. I didn’t come through the backdoor; I came through the front door to express my interest. It is a matter for the party to decide.”
