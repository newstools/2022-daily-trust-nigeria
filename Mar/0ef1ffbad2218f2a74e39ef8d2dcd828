Amidst preparations for the 2023 general elections, a new political movement, Green Nigeria Movement (GNM), has been unveiled in Kano State. The movement is to serve as a nonpartisan platform aimed at restoring what it described as Nigeria’s lost glory ahead of the 2023 general elections. According to the convener of the movement, Moses Siasia, GNM is targeting 40 million votes from the 774 local government areas of Nigeria to bring about the country’s prosperity. Siasia, who is also the Chairman of Nigerian Young Professionals Forum, said the nonpartisan movement will soon recommend the right presidential candidates Nigerians should vote for, insisting that he must be a technocrat. On the right candidate to vote for, Siasia said the movement will unveil him for Nigerians in no distant time. Earlier, one of the conveners, Hamzat Lawal, said the GNM symbol was strategically selected to include green plants, which imply their determination to reclaim the past glory of the country as well as fight hunger and economic challenges.
