Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, a former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has warned that Nigeria will be doomed if the people failed to elect the right leaders to bring the country out of its present state. Addressing members of the PDP caucus of the House of Representatives in Abuja, Atiku said this is the last chance for the country to get it right. “Any failure to elect the right leaders now means Nigeria is doomed. That is why this election is not for us or our personal interests, it is about salvaging the country and I want to seek your support to help me do that,” he said. The PDP presidential hopeful also noted that it is his passion for the progress and development of the country that drives his quest for the presidency, disclosing that he is already working on a policy document that will guide him in the implementation of solutions to the country’s problems. “We owe a debt to this nation. Despite all abilities we have, I feel unfulfilled when I seat back and see how Nigerians travel to have access to basic life requirements. “Nigerians are in desperate need of us and that is why we have to offer them the best. “And this time, more than ever before, we need a leader with vast experience who will fight for the people and a president who can bring this country together. “I guarantee you that I have what it will take to be that kind of president. Therefore, I seek your support. “This victory of our party depends on the candidate we produce at the primary elections at all levels. That is why we must choose those that can easily win at the secondary election,” he said. In his response, the House Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said Atiku has the mental and physical capacity needed to drive PDP to win the election. He said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has corrupted the country, but urged the presidential aspirants to put themselves together and work for the unity of the party as a panacea towards winning the election.
