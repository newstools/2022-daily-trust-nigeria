All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairmanship aspirant and a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, has said he will use the experience he garnered while he was a member of the legislature and governor to re-position and transform the party. He disclosed this when he met with members of the House of Representatives APC Caucus Wednesday. He said his past experience in the elective positions he held had taught him a lot and guided him in the discharge of his duties in various capacities. Yari, who was a one time chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum and held various positions in the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP), said he knows the intricacies of running a party. He said: “It helps me a lot more especially in prioritising allocation of funds. “So, I learnt a lot, and it helped me a lot in governance, in governing the state. “I know I have the capacity to interact within and outside the party and I can be able to work with each and every one of you for the best of our party and the best of ourselves.”
