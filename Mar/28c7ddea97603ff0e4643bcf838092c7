As part of its mission to improve lives through standardization and quality assurance, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has sensitized hundreds of rice millers in Kano on its requirement for third party milling. This, according to the Director General of the organisation, Farouk A. Salim, is in line with the organisation’s policy in promoting consumer confidence and global competitiveness of Nigerian products and services. “We want to help these millers to improve their products to be up to standard; to raise the production standard and also the labelling by using the right machines. “With that, we also ensure the products become accessible in the market and achieve recognition without having any problem in a manner any product one takes across the country will be accepted. “Currently, we have the technical support and will help to guide them with certification so they can be able to meet both local consumption and export. When the product is up to standard, it will be easier to move it across the border,” he stated.
