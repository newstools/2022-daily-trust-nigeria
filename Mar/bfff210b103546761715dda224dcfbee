The race for the National Chairman position of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is becoming more competitive, as five aspirants have thrown their hats into the ring so far. The former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar, on Wednesday, obtained a nomination form to contest for the APC National Chairman position in the forthcoming national convention of the party. The political party has fixed March 26 for the convention after months of dilly-dallying. Abdullahi Adamu, who was said to have been endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari, and Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura have since joined the race for the national chairman of the APC. Both Adamu and Al-Makura are former governors of Nasarawa State. Mustapha Saliu, a former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change (CPC), and a former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, have joined the race too. However, a former Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Chairman National Broadcasting Commission, Hon. Iƙra Aliyu Bilbis, who received the nomination form on behalf of the former Zamfara State governor, said the action was to further demonstrate Yari’s determination to realise his dream of salvaging the party. He said, “The aspiration of the former governor was further fuelled by the fact that he has been a grassroots party man who rose through the ranks to become Secretary and Chairman of a National Party in his State as well as National Financial Secretary respectively.” He said if competence, capacity and capability to deliver at any given situation are ingredients for successful leadership, APC at the national level needs Yari as its National Chairman at this point in time.
