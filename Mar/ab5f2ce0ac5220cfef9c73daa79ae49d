The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has said the global DevOps market is expected to reach $57.9 billion by 2030 and Nigerian start-ups can only benefit from it if they build their capacity adequately. DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and Information Technology (IT) operations. Director-General of the NITDA, Kashifu Abdullahi, stated this on Thursday in Abuja during the opening ceremony of a workshop on Building Lean and Agile Products with DevOps, organised by the Office for Nigerian Digital Innovation (ONDI) and Lotus Beta Analytics Nigeria Ltd. Abdullahi, represented by the acting Director of Digital Economy Development Department (DEDD), NITDA, Salisu Kaka, said: “The global DevOps market size was valued at $6.78bn in 2020 and is projected to reach $57.9bn by 2030. Therefore, this collaboration is apt and timely in ensuring that our start-ups benefit from the DevOps market growth.” He said the workshop was aimed at supporting vibrant and innovative startups to build capacities to scale their businesses through modernisation of legacy solutions, migration of on-premises business solutions to the cloud, development of cloud applications and driving exponential revenue growth.
