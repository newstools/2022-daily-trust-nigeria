The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is committed to making southern Nigeria its fortress. The newly-elected deputy national chairman (South) of the APC, Hon. Emma Eneukwu, said this yesterday in Abuja. According to him, the party is now more united, indivisible and committed to delivering the dividends of democracy to Nigerians. He said, “Be assured that APC will take over the south and we are going to make a statement of intent, with the forthcoming elections in Ondo and Ekiti states. By the year 2023, PDP would be dead in the entire southern part of Nigeria.”
