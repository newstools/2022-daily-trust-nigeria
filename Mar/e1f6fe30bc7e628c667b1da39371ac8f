A 50-year-old widow, Sahura Sulaiman, on Tuesday, dragged her former co-wife, Umma Sulaiman, to a Shari’a court at Rigasa, Kaduna, over her share of their late husband’s property. Sahura, who resides on Cinema Road, Rigasa, told the court that their husband died in 2019, leaving behind two wives and children. She told the court that, “She has refused to give me my share of the inheritance and has also refused to pay some debts owed by our late husband. “Our husband had a house which we all lived in and his pension has been coming, but I was given only N3,000 once.” The complainant, who said she had no child with their late husband, prayed the court to intervene and grant her Justice. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendant was not in court and did not send any representative. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta, ordered that the defendant be served a reminder and adjourned the case to April 13. (NAN)
