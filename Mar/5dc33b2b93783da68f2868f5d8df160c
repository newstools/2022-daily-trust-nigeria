The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State on Monday disclosed that it will not participate in the forthcoming local government elections expected to hold in May. State chairman of APC Comrade Austin Agada disclosed during a press conference shortly after the party’s stakeholders meeting in Makurdi. He said the credibility of the election was already in doubt given alleged dishonesty been evolved by Governor Samuel Ortom to conduct the election. “On the forthcoming Benue State local government elections, we have consulted widely and come to the painful conclusion that our party will not field candidates for the ‘selection’ (election) process owing to the dishonest manner Governor Samuel Ortom and the State Independent Electoral Commission have been conducting their affairs,” he said. The chairman added that instead of wasting their scarce resources in entering the election for which the governor had allegedly determined candidates by even selecting women to head some of the local government councils, “it is safer that we save our scarce resources to teach him a lesson during the 2023 general elections.” When contacted, the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, in his reaction, said the forthcoming local government elections in Benue the state will be free of any encumbrances from any quarters. “The allegations by the APC that the governor plans to rig the council election are frivolous and laughable. This is false and the allegations are without basis. “If the APC claims that it is a popular political party among the Benue people, we will advise the party to test its popularity with the people. “What the party has done now clearly shows that it is not rooted in the state and as such, they cannot face the electorate in a free contest. The claim that the election is designed to be rigged is one of the antics of fear,” Ikyur said.
