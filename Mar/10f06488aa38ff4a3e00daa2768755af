Adamawa State politician, Senator Grace Folashade Bent, has denied being a member of a new political movement called the ‘Third Force’, stressing that she remains a committed member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The former lawmaker, who represented Adamawa South in the Senate between 2007 and 2011 in a statement on Friday accused her political opponents of a sinister plan to link her with the new opposition group for cheap political scores. “As the race to the 2023 general election gathers momentum, political rivalry will be heightened albeit an unhealthy one in order to score cheap political points or cause outright character assassination of opponents both intra and inter-political parties. “Against this backdrop, it becomes expedient for me to expose the latest antics of my political opponents lest the unsuspecting members of the public and my supporters are misled into believing that I am a member of a new political arrangement called the Third Force, which was unveiled in Abuja on Tuesday, February 22, 2022,” she said. The former senate chair on Environment was present at the event but said she attended the event to honour the invitation of friends and associates. She added that she has never contemplated quitting the All Progressives Congress (APC). “For the avoidance of doubt, I remain a committed member of the APC in Adamawa State and beyond and an ardent believer in the progressive leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari,” Senator Bent stated.
