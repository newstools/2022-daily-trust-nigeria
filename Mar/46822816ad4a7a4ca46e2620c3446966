Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s former commissioner for Special Duties, Hajia Aisha Ahman Pategi, has called on the people of Kwara North to disown any of their indigenes that voted for the APC come 2023. Aisha dumped the APC for the opposition PDP at a ceremony held in Pategi LGA of the state. A former key member of the cabinet, Aisha started as commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Community Development during the alleged N300 million LG fund diversion saga in the state. Speaking during the programme, the former commissioner described APC in the state as “Fugi House of Commotion” because of its “persistent crisis”. Speaking on her experience while in the cabinet, she said “I tried to reach out to as many stakeholders in the APC then but not a single one cared.”
