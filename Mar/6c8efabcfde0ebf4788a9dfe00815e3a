A son of a reverend, Engineer Dauda Tawani, has drilled a borehole at the central mosque of Fadan Kamantan in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. He said it was an effort to promote religious tolerance in the area. Southern Kaduna has witnessed several crises linked to religious and ethnic affiliations in the past which made this gesture commendable. Speaking at the commencement of the project in Fadan Kamantan, the District Head of Fadan Kamantan, Mr Sama’ila Tawani, said the project would promote more love and peaceful coexistence among Muslims and Christians in the area. He said the project, executed by Tawani Family Foundation, was sponsored by Engineer Dauda Tawani, an illustrious son of the area to alleviate water scarcity in the mosque. The district head added that the execution of the borehole was part of efforts to remember the legacies of their late father, who was a reverend and also to enhance brotherhood among Muslims and Christians in the area and the state in general. In his remark, Chief Imam of the mosque, Imam Rilwanu Isiyaka Fadan Kamantan, said for a non-Muslim to sink a borehole worth millions of naira in a central mosque and in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area is something that is worth emulating.
