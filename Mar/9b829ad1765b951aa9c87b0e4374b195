The Middle Belt Youth Forum yesterday said nullification of Section 84(12) from the newly amended Electoral Act has made the 2023 general elections more open and participatory to Nigerians. Daily Trust had reported that the section barring government appointees from contesting elective positions while still holding the positions was quashed by a Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia on Friday.

Reacting to the development, youths under the aegis of the Middle Belt Youths Forum (MBYF) yesterday, described the judgment as a welcome development as all political parties began their preparations for the 2023 general elections. In a statement by their leader, Godwin Meliga, the group said, “The Friday judgment is sound and legendary. It is a welcome development. “With the pronouncement, the electoral process is now widened to accommodate some individuals who have earlier been disenfranchised by the controversial section. “It is our hope and belief that as political parties begin their preparations, especially as they are holding their primaries ahead of the general elections, more qualified Nigerians will now be able to participate, irrespective of the current roles they are playing in the government. It is a win for democracy.”
