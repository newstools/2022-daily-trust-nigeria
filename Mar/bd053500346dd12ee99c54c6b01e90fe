 The Plateau State House of Assembly has declared the seat of the impeached speaker, Hon. Ayuba Abok Nuhu, vacant. Abok was impeached as speaker late last year following his grudges with the executive. Hon. Abok, who represents Jos East Constituency under APC, had written a letter to the party on his decamping to the opposition PDP. The Speaker of the House, Yakubu Sanda, who made the declaration during a plenary on Tuesday, said the decision followed a letter sent to the house by the APC chairman in the state seeking the declaration of the seat vacant.
