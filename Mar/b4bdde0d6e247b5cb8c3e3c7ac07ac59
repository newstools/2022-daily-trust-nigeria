The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has flagged off the first non-oil export processing terminal, situated in Ibeshe-Ikorodu, Lagos State. The event is coming ahead of the official launch of the ten (10) certified Export Processing Terminals, spread across Lagos and Ogun states. Speaking at the Ibeshe-Ikorodu facility, designated as EssLibra Terminal, the Managing Director of NPA, Mohammed Bello Koko, implored all agencies involved in the export processing value chain to deploy adequate personnel and work in synergy, to ensure efficiency and quick turnaround in the processing of export cargoes. Whilst commending the management of EssLibra for the quality of facilities at the terminal, he assured them of the readiness of NPA to remove all impediments against the seamless handling of locally manufactured exports and agro-allied commodities. Bello Koko charged the management of the terminal to resist the temptation to veer off export processing for which the facility was built, as the rationale is to have a one stop shop where all inspection, consolidation and stuffing of export-bound cargo will be conducted in a synchronised manner in order to eliminate all the delays that hitherto rendered Nigeria’s non-oil exports uncompetitive. “We took cognisance of local content in the certification process of this terminal, and this is why I expect the host community to take ownership of this terminal and support its operations, in view of the multiplier benefits to the host community”, he said. While conducting the NPA management team on a tour of the terminal, the Managing Director of EssLibra Nigeria Limited, Mr Yemi Adunola, pledged his company’s readiness to render efficient services and a commitment to continuous improvement through sustained investments in human capital and requisite technology.
