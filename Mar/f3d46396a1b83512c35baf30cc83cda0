Senators who are members of the APC have countered reports that the chairman of the party’s caretaker committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, has been sacked. Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, on Monday, presided over the meeting of APC’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee at the national secretariat in Abuja, giving credence to speculations that Buni had been removed. But Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (APC, Kebbi) said the Niger State governor was only acting in the absence of Buni, who has been away on medical grounds. Speaking with newsmen after a closed-door meeting of APC senators yesterday, Senator Abdullahi said,“The speculation in the papers is not exactly true.” He said the meeting was called to dissect issues affecting the party with a view to resolving them ahead of the March 26 convention. “What we are concerned about is the seeming disarray in the party,” he said. Meanwhile, the party has said it will release its zoning formula soon. In an interview with newsmen shortly after a meeting of the caretaker committee held at the party’s national secretary in Abuja, on Tuesday, the acting chairman of the committee and Niger State Governor Sani Bello said there were discussions around the convention sub-committees. He said the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party would meet next week to reach key decisions ahead of the March 26 national convention. Secretary of the caretaker committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, has said he has not resigned. There were reports that Senator Akpanudoedehe had resigned following the developments in the party. But addressing newsmen at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja on Tuesday, he said he is still the authentic secretary of the party’s caretaker committee. “I am waiting for the chairman. If we have directive from the president that we should resign, we are not bigger than the president, we will do so, if we hear from him,” he said.
