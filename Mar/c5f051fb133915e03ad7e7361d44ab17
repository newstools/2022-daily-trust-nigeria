In its bid to curb incessant parking on the road, the Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana, Kogi State, has put in place park infrastructures that can accommodate thousands of trucks at a time. This much was revealed by the company’s National Director for Logistics, Mr. Juan Carlos Rincon when members of the House of Representatives Committee on Road Safety Commission visited the Dangote Cement Plant, Obajana. According to him, even though it is the responsibility of the government to provide road infrastructure, the company will continue to lend a helping hand, as exemplified by the construction of Nigeria’s longest concrete road in Kogi State. Mr Rincon said the Lokoja-Road is being overstretched because other roads linking the north and the south are grossly in a state of disrepair. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Road Safety Commission, Hon Akinfolarin Mayowa Samuel has said that there must be a collaborative effort between the government and the private sector in the management of Nigerian roads. He said the challenges of road infrastructure in Nigeria cannot be handled by the Dangote alone. The Chairman who bemoaned the traffic gridlock at Kabba Junction in Kogi State urged the company to up its interventional scheme by easing traffic jams, adding that the Lokoja-Kabba road was sensitive and central to the road network in the country.
