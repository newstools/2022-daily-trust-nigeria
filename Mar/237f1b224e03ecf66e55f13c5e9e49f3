The Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has denied a statement credited to him that he is the ‘anointed’ All Progressives Congress’ presidential flagbearer. Onu, in a statement signed on his behalf on Thursday by the spokesman of the ministry, Afonja Ajibola, said his rumoured presidential ambition was meant to destroy his personality and achievements in the ministry. “The attention of the Honourable Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has been drawn to a report by some political destabilisers who are bent on destroying the personality of the Minister and the APC, in order to derail the progress being made in the STI ecosystem in the country. “To get the facts straight, Dr Onu has not at any time made the statement as credited to him by the political jobbers in the said publication. “Rather, Dr Onu in his loyal and committed nature is presently focused on using Science and Technology for the development of a knowledge-driven and innovation-centred economy required to move Nigeria into the 4th industrial revolution. “Members of the Nigerian public at home and in the diaspora should ignore this false publication,” the statement said.
