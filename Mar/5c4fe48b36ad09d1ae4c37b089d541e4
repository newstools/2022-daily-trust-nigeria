Agitations among the various geo-political zones in the country are raging over the sharing of the National Working Committee (NWC) and the 2023 elective offices of the APC. This followed the setting up of the party’s zoning committee headed by Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. Sources from the South East hinted to our correspondent, Thursday that the zone was agitating for the presidential ticket and national secretary of the party. A member of the APC National Caucus, Chief Sam Nkire, told Daily Trust in a telephone interview yesterday that what mattered most to the South East was the party’s presidential ticket. “The South East sees the 2023 presidency as its birthright. Our goal is to produce the next president of Nigeria. We can trade anything but we can’t trade the presidency of Nigeria,” he said. Another chieftain of the party from the South East and former presidential candidate, Chief Chekwas Okorie, however, said in addition to the presidential ticket, the region was gunning for the office of national secretary. Sources from the North Central hinted that they are out for the apex office of national chairman. Another stalwart of the party from the North East, Barrister Abdullahi Jalo, however, said, “Zoning has already been discussed so let’s wait for the official position of the Buni-committee.” Meanwhile, sources at the APC national secretariat confided to our correspondent that the zoning committee is set to commence meeting with critical stakeholders regarding its assignment.
