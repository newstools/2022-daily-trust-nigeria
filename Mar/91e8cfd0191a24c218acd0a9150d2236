Ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general elections, a former gubernatorial candidate of the African Peoples Alliance (APA), Alhaji Mustapha Othman, has said he will use traditional rulers to secure Kaduna State if elected governor. Othman, who is running for the governorship of the state on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said traditional rulers will be assigned roles by leveraging on the federal government’s security formation to ensure peace in the state. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna where he presented his eight-point agenda, the gubernatorial aspirant said he will run an open-door governance and prioritise the welfare of the people if elected. “My election is hinged on eight key mandates which are insecurity, massive agricultural, education, welfare/ industrialization, infrastructure, health, peace and prosperity, integrated data management systems and decentralization of governance,” he said.
