The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alerted Nigerians of an alleged plot by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to alter the newly passed Electoral Act 2022 and introduce clauses that will compromise the 2023 elections. PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, said APC, having realized that it was running out of time and could not meet up with the already released electoral timetable, now sought to frustrate and derail the ongoing electoral process. The party said it has it on good authority that the Buhari presidency has perfected plots to use the APC leadership in the National Assembly to orchestrate an amendment to the Electoral Act to create an opening for INEC to alter its already released 2023 Election Timetable and Schedule of Activities to accommodate the APC. He said: “Our party has information about how the APC has been mounting pressure on INEC to push forward the already scheduled dates for the 2023 general elections. “The PDP vehemently rejects this plot by the APC which amounts to shifting the goal post in the middle of the game and cautions INEC to resist such heinous design against our democracy. “The election timetable has already been released, political parties have commenced processes, Nigerians have since set their minds on the election dates to vote out the APC and there is no going back on that resolve.” The party also urged all PDP members in the National Assembly to be vigilant and firmly resist this plot.
