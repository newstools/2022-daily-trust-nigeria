Several members of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) task force, on Wednesday, escaped death after they were attacked by hoodlums with stones, cutlasses and other weapons in Kuchigoro community along Airport Road. City & Crime gathered that five officials of the task force sustained injuries in the attack and that 10 suspects were apprehended and handed over to the police. The task force team was in the community in continuation of its ongoing massive cleanup and clampdown on Okada riders violating traffic rules along the Lugbe-Airport road axis. The senior special assistant on monitoring, inspection and enforcement to the FCT minister, Ikharo Attah, who was among the officials who escaped unhurt, said the hoodlums apparently were angered that the shanties and illegal structures housing them under high tension electrical lines were being removed. However, Mr Attah reaffirmed that the task force would not be deterred by the serial attacks by people who were opposed to the enforcement of orders and regulations needed to make Abuja a model city. The imam of Kuchigoro, Usman Yahaya, who was also caught up in the attack, condemned the action of the hoodlums, saying he supported the removal of the illegal structures and fight against criminality in the area. Imam Yahaya, who said he had lived in the community for over 20 years, noted that the action of the hoodlums had brought a bad image to the community.
