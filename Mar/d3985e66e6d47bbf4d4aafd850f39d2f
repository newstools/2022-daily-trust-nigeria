APM Terminals, Nigeria’s largest container terminal in Apapa, says it has committed about 438 million US dollars, about N182 billion, into the development of cargo handling equipment in the country. It said part of the amount was spent in the construction of a new digitalised administrative building in its Apapa terminal. The commissioning of the new smart building,  took place at the terminal in Lagos Port Complex (LPC), Apapa, on Tuesday. Speaking at the event, the Global Chief Operating Officer (COO) of APM Terminals, Keith Svendsen  said the new building will set new standard for port operations in Nigeria. “What is more important is to make sure that we are ready for the future. A port is one of the infrastructures that take years to plan and build.” He said. The APM Terminals COO also said the technology embedded in the new building will improve container handling operations and processing in the terminal, particularly in enabling electronic invoicing, electronic receipt and online payment processes that allow customers to fast-track their documentation. Also speaking, the Country Managing Director of APM Terminals Nigeria, Klaus Laursen, said APM Terminals Apapa has led with a strong ambition to become a world-class terminal operator. On his part, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, commended APM Terminals for raising the standards of port operation in Nigeria, and for adding immense value to the port over the past 16 years.
