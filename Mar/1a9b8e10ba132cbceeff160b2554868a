The Lagos State government has said it is investigating a viral video showing kegs of petrol being handed out as souvenirs at an event centre in the state. The State’s commissioner of information and strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday. Recently, a lady identified as Chidinma Pearl Ogbulu caught the attention of Nigerians on social media with her choice of souvenirs at her installation ceremony as Erelu Okin. A video from the event captured a stack of 10-litre kegs containing petrol that had been lined up for guests who came to celebrate with her. But Omotoso said: “There is no doubt that this action is dangerous and can lead to loss of lives and property. “It is blatantly against all safety measures in such places,” he said. “The Lagos State Government through the Safety Commission is investigating this matter and will ensure that all parties to this reprehensible action are made to account for it. “The safety of lives and properties of Lagosians and visitors remains a top priority to the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. “We, therefore, advise that actions that can lead to loss of lives and properties be avoided.” Nigerians have continued to face petrol scarcity as long queues are seen in filling stations across the country. Despite the promises of the federal government that there was enough petrol for oil marketers, the queues would not go away for over a month now. Some filling stations sell a litre for as high as N250 in some states of the federation which has resulted in a hike in transport fares.
