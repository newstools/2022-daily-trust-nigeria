JUST IN: Peter Obi joins 2023 presidential race New Birth Control Pill For Men Is 99% Safe – Research Speaking with newsmen shortly after obtaining her nomination and expression of interest forms at the PDP secretariat in Abuja, Susan said “A state abundantly gifted with rich, agricultural fields covered by fresh, clean, and unadulterated flowing rivers, one of which it was later named after, Benue, is a safe-haven in the grasslands with vast human resources. “The state had and still has irreplaceable potential, and has a strong promise for a better future. Our state was so endowed that it was projected to feed the entire nation and serve as a gateway for export to other countries. Unfortunately, our motto as the food basket of the nation has become a fantasy over the years. “The euphoria that accompanied the creation of Benue in 1976 has vanished, leaving behind a frightening reality of underdevelopment, unemployment, poverty, hunger, insecurity, corruption, and a loss of pride.” Waya also revealed that her focus is to restore the glory of the state and also build the productive economy of the state. “Our priority is to restore our beloved state back to its glory days and build a more productive and diversified economy by investing heavily in security, agriculture, infrastructure, health, power, ICT, and tax cuts.” So far, Kiddwaya’s mum is the only woman in the 2023 governorship race in the state.
