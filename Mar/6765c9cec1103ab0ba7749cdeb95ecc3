A former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said he is eminently qualified to be the national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Senator Adamu has been endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors, but some leaders of the party are opposed to this. The lawmaker who spoke through one of his aides, Ambassador Samuel Jimba, said the claim by the “so-called” APC national stakeholders led by Aliyu Audu that he was not qualified to chair the affairs of the ruling party was laughable. He said, “Who are the national stakeholders’ group? I don’t see any identity that qualifies them to become national stakeholders as opposed to other persons who have significantly contributed to the party and who qualify as party icons, party leaders and party stakeholders. “I don’t know whether any of them have contributed the much that those people they are accusing; Sen. Abdullahi Adamu and Sen. Ken Nnamani have contributed to the development of this country and to the development of the APC. “So, as far as I am concerned they do not carry sufficient weight to deserve any attention at the national level and they should not cause unnecessary distractions for what the APC is set to do, which is to hold a convention that becomes a classic example of how every political party should hold a convention, come March 26 this year. “But, when you come and say you don’t want somebody and then you don’t provide an alternative, I think you do not deserve to get any attention at all and so as far as I am concerned they should be ignored. “They do not have any sufficient weight to be able to talk nationally on issues of the APC and the national convention and the national chairman.”
