A group, MBO Dynamic Support Group, has said the emergence of Niger State Governor Sani Bello as chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee will arrest the crisis in the party. President Muhammadu Buhari was reported to have sacked the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni and replaced him with Governor Bello, who took over the party’s affairs on Monday. A statement on Tuesday in Abuja, by the National Coordinator of the group, Hon Usman Ibrahim, said Buhari should also remove the “bad eggs” from his government. It said, “The unfolding scenario in the party for the past one year was giving us sleepless nights and every committed party faithful was watching helplessly as the party was delving into a self-inflicted crisis. “We have observed over the period the confusion trailing party registration, ward congress, LGA and state congresses which have plunged the party into unending legal tussles as a result of the shoddy management of the party affairs.”
