The Osun State High Court in Osogbo, on Wednesday, dismissed a “no case submission” filed by counsels to the accused persons in the murder of a student of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Timothy Adegoke. The chief judge of the state, Justice Adepele Ojo, held that the owner of Hilton Honour Hotel, Ile-Ife, Abdulrahmon Adedoyin, and seven other accused persons in the case had a case to answer over the death of Adegoke who lodged in the hotel. Earlier, the prosecutor, M.O Omosun, prayed the court that a no case submission by all the defendants be dismissed as a prima facie had been established based on all evidences presented before the court. Justice Ojo ruled that with the exhibits presented by witnesses and admitted in evidence by the court, the prosecution was able to establish a prima facie that Adegoke lodged at the Hilton Honour Hotel, Ile-Ife, and that his body was interfered with and disrespectfully evacuated. She then discharged the “no case submission” and ordered that they entered their defence and then adjourned the case to April 25.
