The immediate past chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, has attributed the failure of successive governments to the non-functional democratic system in the 774 local government areas. Nwobu stated this in an interview with newsmen on Wednesday during the party’s local governments congress held in the state. He said the major causes of the insecurity ravaging the country are traceable to the non-functional local government system. “Insecurity and other things could be attributed to non-conduct of local government due to absence of governance instrument at the local base,” he said. According to him, if elected local government officials are functional and with duly elected chairmen and legislatures presiding over the affairs of the councils, many of the unemployed youths who today roam the streets would have been gainfully employed.
