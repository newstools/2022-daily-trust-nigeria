Some All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders under the aegis of Akume Coalition have said the national chairmanship ambition of a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, is not a threat to a former governor of Benue State, Senator George Akume’s. This is sequel to reports in some quarters that President Muhammadu Buhari had endorsed Adamu as the next national chairman of the party. Addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, the Director General of Akume Coalition, Suleiman Zelani, said Akume, the current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs would reposition and stabilise the party for more victories if given the mandate. He said, “Akume is God sent, not just to APC but to the Nigerian people. As stakeholders in this project, we will not relent our campaign based on what is going on in the pages of newspapers (Abdullahi Adamu’s endorsement) as far as no official communication has been passed on that.” But another group within the APC known as the New Generation Forum (NGF) has asked delegates to next Saturday’s national convention to elect Adamu as chairman. Addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, the National Coordinator, Comrade Charles Ibiang, said Adamu would stabilise the party if given the mandate. He said, “Based on our wide consultations with stakeholders in the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu remains the best option for the office of APC national chairman, taking a look at his track record of achievements in politics both at the local and national levels.” Meanwhile, the Amalgamated Union of Foodstuffs and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria (AUFCDN) has urged APC to consider Adamu as its national chairman. President of AUFCDN, Dr. Muhammed Tahir, during a press briefing yesterday, said if given the opportunity, Adamu would lead the party to victory.
