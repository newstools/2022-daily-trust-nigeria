The Nigeria Police Force, Oyo State Command, on Wednesday, paraded a rat killer seller and his three children over alleged kidnapping and killing of an eight-year-old boy, Abdulraheem Bamimore. Parading the suspects in Ibadan at the command’s Headquarters in Eleyele, the Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko, said that the suspects committed the offences on March 4 in Saki area of the state. Onadeko said, “the dragnet of the command caught up with the suspects on Monday for allegedly abducting and murdering Abdulraheem, an eight-year-old minor.” The commissioner quoted the man saying that two of the suspects lured his son to an undisclosed location, after which, all efforts made to locate him proved abortive. “On March 7, a search party was organised and during the process, the lifeless body of the victim named Abdulraheem Bamimore (male), aged eight years, was found inside an uncompleted building at Alubarika area, Saki. “Upon interrogation, two of the suspects (nameswitheld), confessed to have conspired to kidnap the victim for ransom, but eventually killed him because he (victim) recognised and could identify them. “Further updates on the incident would be provided in due course as investigation continues,” Onadeko said.
