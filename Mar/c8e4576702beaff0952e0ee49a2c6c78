There is tension within the political camps of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abaji Area Council as the Supreme Court is set to deliver judgement tomorrow on the authentic chairmanship flag bearer of the party during the last February 12 FCT council poll. Both Alhaji Mohammed Angulu Loko and Abubakar Umar Abdullahi are laying claim to the candidate of the party won at the poll. It was observed that supporters of the two APC candidates have taken to social media to express diverse opinions on what the outcome of the verdict would be. There is also anxiety among elders and stakeholders of the APC in the area as they anticipate victory from the court judgement. City & Crime has reported that a five-member panel of judges of the Supreme Court led by Justice Alukayode Ariwoola had on March 1, 2022, after adoption of briefs from both counsels fixed March 16, 2022 for judgement.
