Represented by Executive director Corporate Services, Emily Osuji, the MD said: “In NDIC, we are proud of our women who are well represented at all levels of the organisation. The Management of the Corporation have continued to provide an enabling environment for our women to thrive in their chosen careers.” Chairman of the Board of Directors of NDIC, Mrs Ronke Sokefun in her remark said:the question of sustainability is however, one to dwell on. How do we sustain this development? Are women in leadership positions doing enough to encourage more women to join the table to ensure the number keeps growing and therefore ensure sustainability? “Let me say this clearly: You will be pulled up when you demonstrate a readiness for that next role. When that opportunity presents itself and even though there are also qualified men, we can boldly say yes we stand with her. Not just because she is female but also because she has the requisite competence and capability for the role.” Guest speaker, the Managing Director of FCMB, Yemisi Edun congratulated the corporation for having 40 per cent of its staff members as women. She said: “Even though being a woman qualifies us to be seen or heard, we have to do much more. We must work purposefully to ensure that the claim we make, we can prove,” she said.
