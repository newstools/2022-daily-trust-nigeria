He said, “Giving a timeline of 2022, we hit the ground running as far back as 2017 and to date, we have made tremendous progress, as we speak today, at 73.3 per cent completion, we now have less than 25 per cent to go.” Beyond the 2022 completion deadline, he said, “All the feeder lines and pipelines that will interconnect with the AKK are progressing as we speak.” On the high price of domestic cooking gas, he said, the exchange rate, the demand and supply gap as well as the over-reliance on original equipment manufacturers led to the increase in the price. The Executive Secretary of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Professor Idris Bujaje while describing the AKK as the most important project brought by President Muhammadu Buhari said, it will solve a mirage of problems the country is facing. Speaking on behalf of the awardees, the Emir of Lere, Engineers Suleiman Umar thanked the association for recognising him after his career at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
