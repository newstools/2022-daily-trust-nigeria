The Etsu Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo, has called on monarchs in the FCT to sensitise their subjects to participate in the 2022 national census as it would determine the distribution of resources to local councils. Speaking with journalists in his palace, the Etsu said when traditional rulers play their roles effectively, credible figures can be generated that would aid government’s planning in budgetary allocations among others. While stating that census figures could be released for politics and political gains, he noted that at the end of the day, its accurate implementation would lead to decisions that spur development of local communities with provision of necessary infrastructure. “We as traditional rulers, it is our duty to mobilise and conscientise the people about census that it is not those activities that government will renege on promise. It is a very serious business for the nation and every citizen must participate in it.” “It is a rigorous activity for the traditional leaders and community leaders. The people need to be counted and know how many we are, not only the people alone but also the categories of people because we need to know what facilities we have to provide for children, women and those capacitated like the blind, deaf and so on.” He however urged the federal government to release adequate funds for the census and the deployment of dedicated staff that would act professionally while engaged in the task as the 2022 census would be the most difficult to conduct due to the happenings in the country.
