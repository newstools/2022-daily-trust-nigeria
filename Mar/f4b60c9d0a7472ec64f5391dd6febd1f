Ahead of the 2023 general elections, some stakeholders in politics have called for the inclusion of more women in elective positions. They made the call in Abuja on Tuesday at the 2022 Women Aspirants Summit tagged ‘Working Together for a Democratic Nigeria’, organised by Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), Women In Politics Forum (WIPF) and Women Radio. The event, which was organised for female aspirants, was to enable them to network irrespective of party affiliation. In her paper titled, ‘Electoral Act 2022 and Women’s Participation in the 2023 General Elections’, the Director, Gender and Inclusivity Department at INEC, Mrs Blessing Obidegwu, said the commission, as an Election Management Body (EMB), strives toward gender responsiveness in its politics and practices, within and outside the commission. Chief Executive Officer of NWTF, Ms Mufuliat Fijabi, said challenges that affect women’s participation include lack of resources to compete well with male candidates.
