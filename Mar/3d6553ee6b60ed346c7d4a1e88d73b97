 The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, (NIMASA), have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for NiMet to provide weather services in the maritime sector. Nigeria has not been providing meteorological services to shipping lines navigating Nigerian waters thus losing huge revenues. According to a statement, the signing ceremony held at NIMASA headquarters in Lagos where the Director-General/CEO of NiMet, Prof. Mansur Matazu assured that NiMet will extend and standardise its services to the marine and maritime sector just as it entails in the aviation sector, bringing credibility to the nation’s indigenous skills, products, and services. The Director-General/ CEO NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Yusuf Jamoh, enjoined Nigerians to watch out, not only for daily forecasts from NiMet, but a forecast for maritime safety and security through NiMet from NIMASA. The signing of the MoU between NiMet and NIMASA is a milestone agreement that will ensure sustainable development.
