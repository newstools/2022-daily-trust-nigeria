The Director-General, National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Jelani Aliyu, has called on the digital economy sector for support and partnership as part of efforts to develop and sustain the automotive industry in Nigeria. He made the call during a working visit to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, on Monday in Abuja. The minister also used the opportunity to test drive first Nigeria’s locally assembled Electric Car (Hyundai Kona) even as he was presented with various models of locally manufactured, tech-driven, battery and gas-powered vehicles. Aliyu in his presentation explained that the automotive industry with the right support was capable of producing 400,000 vehicles annually. He commended the federal government’s efforts in restoring the industry to its lost glory and boosting indigenous production through the institution of the National Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP). “The vehicles manufactured and assembled in Nigeria are very tech-driven and it is only natural to seek your support as the driver of the digital economy in the country,” he said. He emphasised that the resuscitation of the Nigerian automotive industry will create jobs, encourage innovation and build indigenous capacity among others. “We must therefore heed Mr President’s call to produce what we consume and consume what we produce. We also need to create awareness among the populace to take pride in our indigenous products and patronise them,” he said.
