Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) say they are working towards the process to produce consensus candidates ahead of March 26th National Convention. The chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said this Wednesday while fielding questions from State House reporters after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Bagudu, who said the APC governors would support any process that would lead to a consensus, urged his colleagues to explore the option. He said each governor presented the allocation of party positions at zonal level to President Buhari. The President had last month said he was in favour of the consensus option to produce candidates for the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) offices. The meeting was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and 16 governors from Kebbi, Plateau, Kogi, Yobe, Ogun, Kaduna, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Imo, Niger, Jigawa, Kwara, Zamfara, Nasarawa, and Borno States.
