He noted that the intervention project was a passionate task for NDPHC. “That is why although we are basically a generation company, we provide transmission and distribution services because we know that after generating electricity, it must get to the end-users to become meaningful.” Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, while speaking on the 2.5MVA, 33/11kV injection substation with 33kV/11kV low tension lines and the installation of three units of 500kVA transformers, said, “Looking at the technical details of this project and its benefits, an upgrade from 2.5MVA to 7.5MVA, I believe it will address two critical areas of concern to our administration in this corridor.” Akeredolu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa said: “With regular power supply on campus, students will have access to electrical appliances and tools like computer and internet facilities to enhance their education.” The Rector of the polytechnic, Mr Gani Ogundahunsi said: “The project is going to be a massive help for us because we have been spending so much on diesel. “This facility is going to help us in distribution and every other thing as it pertains to the power situation in this polytechnic.”
