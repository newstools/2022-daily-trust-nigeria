As part of activities to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day, and in line with global efforts at addressing issues of climate change and reducing its impact on the environment, the FCT Administration has donated 6,000 varieties of economic tree seedlings to women groups in the territory. FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, while speaking at the event organised by the FCT Social Development Secretariat stated that the significance of the occasion cannot be over emphasized considering the vital role that trees play in the sustenance of the ecosystem; keeping the climate stable, absorbing carbon dioxide, among others. While speaking on this year’s theme: “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow,” the minister described the theme as appropriate as it aimed at advancing gender equality in the context of climate change which has been the greatest global challenges in the 21st century and the efforts to reduce the effects on the environment. Aliyu said; “In this wise, the Federal Capital Territory, has decided to use today’s occasion to flag off tree planting campaign as part of our efforts to address the numerous challenges of climate change. This also tells us that women are not only after living for today, but leaving a sustainable tomorrow for the generations to come.”
