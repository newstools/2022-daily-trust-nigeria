One month after the elective congress of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, the newly elected state working committee is yet to be inaugurated Daily Trust reports. Our correspondent learnt that the delay was due to the controversy that trailed the congress as the consensus option earlier adopted by the party caucus was jettisoned. The party had conducted its congress on February 27, where a former Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Tourism in the state, Mr Philip Aivoji, was elected defeating Dr Amos Fawole, who was adopted as the consensus candidate. Daily Trust had reported how two unity lists emerged at the venue of the congress prompting the electoral committee chairman, Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State, to throw the race open for a contest. Delegates, however, rejected the unity list adopted by the party leaders and members of the board of trustees in the state during a meeting facilitated by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. However, the outcome of the congress did not go down well with some party leaders which explained why the new executive is yet to be inaugurated. It could be recalled that the national secretariat had extended the tenure of the caretaker committee prior to the election which now expired on March 19. One month after the congress and almost two weeks after the tenure of the caretaker committee lapsed, the new executive members are yet to be inaugurated amidst agitation. But the newly elected publicity secretary of the party, Akeem Amode, said the inauguration will be done very soon, disclosing that the National Working Committee (NWC) had already ratified the new state working committee.
