In a bid to enhance digital literacy, the Lagos State government through the Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment has empowered and equipped 1,140 youths with digital entrepreneurship skills. The training, which was held in conjunction with Messrs Digital Age Consulting was aimed at promoting digital literacy among youths while also exposing them to means of livelihood using the global space. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the graduation ceremony of the training tagged: ‘21st Century Talent Discovery and IT-Enabled Entrepreneurship Skills and Mentorship’, commended the 1,140 youths that have participated in the intensive, cutting-edge training programme for taking a good step and taking advantage of the opportunities by the scheme. Sanwo-Olu who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Folashade Jaji encouraged young people to stop seeing academic certificates as an end in itself, but rather a means to an end. According to him, the true essence of education is to enhance the ability to identify and harness their innate talents. Earlier, the Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke disclosed that 20 best-talented youths have been selected among the trainees to become the ministry’s wealth ambassadors. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Digital Age Consulting, Dr Abimbola Ekunnusi described the training as an extensive digital entrepreneurship programme with the best exposure that would help the participants navigate the 21st-century challenges as global champions who can compete favourably with their contemporaries across the world.
