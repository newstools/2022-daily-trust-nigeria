Governor of Nasarawa State and Chairman of the Publicity Sub-committee for the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Abdullahi Sule, has said President Muhammadu Buhari and governors on the platform of the party opted for consensus in order to have a peaceful exercise on Saturday. Buhari had met with APC governors at the State House in Abuja on Wednesday where they agreed on consensus. Addressing newsmen at the party’s national secretariat on Thursday in Abuja, Governor Sule said the APC governors are now more united and would go into the convention as one united family. He said the number of delegates was not yet ascertained, adding that the number of delegates to vote during the convention would be determined after accreditation. The governor said, “As I mentioned earlier, we have been driven towards a consensus arrangement so that we can have a very peaceful convention after which most of the political activities will begin which will lead to the success of the party at most of the elections that we are going to have next year by the grace of God. “We also want to inform you that the major caucuses of this party, we have been meeting in order to discuss most of the grey areas and resolve them and so far again so good all the governors had been inspired yesterday (Wednesday). “We actually had a meeting with Mr President where some grey areas were resolved and the governors are now united more than you can ever think. We are going as a united front into this convention. “We also look forward actually to a convention that is going to signify our unity and our strength as we come together to face the election next year.”
