Morocco‘s national carrier – Royal Air Maroc has described its membership of the global airlines’ network, Oneworld, as a strategic move that will give its passengers access to connect into any part of the world with other carriers. This is just as the airline added more than 30 new destinations in Africa to the network. At a briefing to mark the second year anniversary of joining Oneworld held in Lagos, Nigeria, Royal Air Maroc Chief Finance Officer, Karim Benchekroun, and Oneworld Chief Executive Officer, Rob Gurney, said as the only African airline on the alliance, passengers on the network are positioned to enjoy better connection between the continent and other parts of the world. Benchekroun said the carrier considers Nigeria as a very important market for Royal Air Maroc hence the decision to celebrate its second year anniversary into Oneworld alliance in Lagos. He said: “We are here to communicate directly with our customers about this membership and the considerable advantages it offers.” He also spoke of plans to improve the airline’s market share in Nigeria while hinting on plans to return its Abuja flight as the passengers’ number grows.

One of it is the gas pipeline.”
