A former minister of water resources and two-term deputy governor of Sokoto State, Barrister Mukhtari Shehu Shagari, has joined the race for the governorship ticket of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Sokoto State. Similarly, the eldest son of former governor Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, Sagir Bafarawa, was at the secretariat of the party on Thursday to consult its leaders over his ambition to contest for the ticket. Shagari, it was gathered, notified the leadership of the party of his ambition via a letter. The publicity secretary of the party, Yusuf Abdullahi Hausawa, who confirmed this to our reporter, said Shagari notified them through a letter which was attached with his manifesto for the state. Similarly, Bafarawa, who is the Commissioner for Environment in the state, told Daily Trust that he had started making consultation in response to the calls by the people of the state for him to come out and contest.
