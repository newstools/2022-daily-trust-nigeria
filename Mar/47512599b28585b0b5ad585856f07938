Some aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos have repudiated the olive branch extended to them by the chairman of the party, Mr. Cornelius Ojelabi, saying there cannot be peace without justice. Daily Trust reports that the state APC had been in crisis since the parallel congresses held last year with four factions conducting their separate congresses but with the party recognising the mainstream party leadership under Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Ojelabi had during the inauguration of the state executive committee on Monday, said all caucuses should put the interest of the party against personal interest while tasking members of the new committee to go back to their various constituencies and begin “a process of harmony and genuine reconciliation.” However, some aggrieved members under the umbrella of Lagos Political Front (LPF) insisted the new chairman was “unlawfully imposed.” Chairman of the group Toyin Raheem rejected Ojelabi’s statement “asking all caucuses in the party to embrace peace and come together”. According to him, there cannot be peace without justice and the honourable thing for him to do is “stepping aside for a new congress in Lagos State.” In his reaction, the spokesman of APC, Mr, Seye Oladejo said, “The peace move of the state chairman is open-ended. The disposition of any group will not change that position. We can only appeal to all and sundry to accept the olive branch in the spirit of true reconciliation.”
