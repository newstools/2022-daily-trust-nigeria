The SME Business School which began on March 14 and ended on March 18, 2022, is a capacity-building platform for equipping business owners with the relevant business tools and skills to enable them to run their businesses more profitably and efficiently. According to a statement from the bank, 150 participants graduated this session with experienced facilitators from Swifta, IBFC Alliance, Pedabo Consulting Limited, MTN, Development Bank of Nigeria amongst others. The idea of the business school came after the bank’s research and several other studies by global business organizations and research bodies which revealed the gap areas SMEs are grappling with in terms of having proper structure for their businesses.
