An advocacy group under the auspices of Abuja Grassroots Advocacy Projects (AGAP) has commended the staff and management of Garki General Hospital for their selfless services to residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The group hailed the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) adopted in the hospital to meet the health challenges of the residents. The chief advocate of the group, Comrade Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf, at a press briefing explained that the PPP which the hospital enjoys has made it stand out among other hospitals in the FCT. The group noted that during the doctors’ national strike, it was only the hospital that stood as a lifesaver to residents of the territory. Yusuf said from their observation, the PPP of Garki General Hospital over the years has worked out perfectly and so many people have benefited from improved health services. “So, we are calling on the FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, to checkmate and monitor prices of accessing health services in the hospitals, to ensure that everybody can access health services as it is found in Garki hospital,’’ he said.
