A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Yobe State, Ibrahim Mohammed Jirgi, has cautioned stakeholders in the APC to desist from actions and utterances capable of escalating tensions, adding that time is not on the side of the party. Jirgi, a one-time Special Adviser Media and Public Affairs to former Governor Bukar Abba Ibrahim of Yobe State and member APC 2015 Presidential Campaign Council, frowned at what he called Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufa’i’s penchant for diversionary political behaviour and advised him to steer clear. “Mai Mala Buni remains the chairman; we are all living witnesses to his achievements and sacrifices, we are proud of his leadership style of reaching out to all,” Jirgi said.
