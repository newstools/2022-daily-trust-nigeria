A former National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, on Tuesday said President Muhammadu Buhari betrayed former Senate President Bukola Saraki shortly after he (Buhari) assumed office. Speaking during a meeting with the state PDP executive members in Gusau, Zamfara State capital, Baraje said President Buhari’s administration had dragged Saraki to court about five times and he (Saraki) won the cases. “Bukola Saraki had used his resources, time and energy to ensure that President Buhari won the 2015 presidential election. However, after winning the election, President Buhari persecuted Saraki by spewing spurious allegations against him,” he said. He assured the executive members of the PDP in Zamfara State that, “the illegal impeachment of the state Deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, would never see the light of the day and his mandate would be restored.” He said Saraki is set to become the next president of Nigeria and with the tenacity, courage, hope and hard work of the PDP supporters across the nation that would be achievable. In his remarks, the chairman of PDP in the state, retired Col Bala Mande, said Saraki’s exemplary leadership qualities can’t be dismissed with the wave of hand even as vowed to work to ensure that the party succeeds at levels of governance.
