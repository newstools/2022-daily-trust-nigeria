The MTN Group has announced senior leadership appointments to operating companies in Nigeria, Iran and Sudan, all of them internal candidates. “Today’s announcement demonstrates the depth of talent within the group, as well as the strength of our succession planning,” MTN Group President and CEO, Ralph Mupita, said. Following the recent appointment of MTN Nigeria Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mazen Mroue, as MTN Group Chief Information and Technology Officer, Hassan Jaber assumes the COO role at MTN Nigeria. He moves from MTN Irancell, where he serves as COO, bringing with him some 25 years of telecoms and digital experience within the MTN Group. Jaber’s track record of building and scaling-up telecom operations and developing digital businesses through the power of mobile technology will be instrumental to MTN Nigeria as it plays its part in delivering on the group’s strategic intent of leading digital solutions for Africa’s progress. He has served MTN in numerous markets, including Ghana, Guinea-Conakry, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. Malik Melamu, with over 28 years of managerial and executive experience, will assume the position of MTN Irancell COO, joining from MTN Sudan where he has been CEO over the last five years.
