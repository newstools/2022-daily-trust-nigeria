The Aragbiji of Iragbijiland, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Ayotunde Olabomi, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to compel the inspector general of police to ensure justice for his son, Saheed Olabomi, who was killed by a policeman, Sgt Adamu Garuba, in Osogbo. At a press conference in his palace yesterday, the traditional ruler said Olabomi was gruesomely killed by the policeman, adding that the family wanted justice for the deceased, lamenting that Sgt Garuba had not been prosecuted. Olabomi was shot dead by the policeman at about 5pm at Oke-Onitii area of Osogbo, the state capital, on July 27, 2021. The incident resulted into a riot, as youths blocked major roads in Osogbo, protesting the killing. The monarch, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to compel the inspector general of police to arrest and prosecute the policeman. The police spokesman in the state, Yemisi Opalola, said the policeman that killed Olabomi was arrested, detained and dismissed by the commissioner of police over the matter, but that he had appealed at a higher level against his dismissal. The spokesman, therefore, pleaded with the traditional ruler and other relatives of the deceased to be patient and allow the policeman to exhaust his right of appeal, saying the report of his appeal would be out soon.
