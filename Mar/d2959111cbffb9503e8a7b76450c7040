Sterling Bank Plc said it has carried out environmental cleaning exercises across markets, roads and beaches in Lagos and 22 other states through its Sterling Bank Environmental Makeover (STEM) scheme to mark World Recycling Day. A statement by the bank said the exercises held simultaneously in Abuja, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Kwara, Ondo, Ekiti, Kano, Jigawa, Kaduna, Abuja, Delta, Anambra, Edo, Abia, Imo, Rivers, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom, Gombe, Bauchi, Plateau, Katsina and Lagos. More than 1,000 people participated in the clean-up exercises, including staff of Sterling Bank and volunteers. Speaking at the beach cleaning exercise at Oniru Beach, Lagos, the Managing Director and CEO of Sterling Bank, Mr Abubakar Suleiman, said the bank has been on the exercise for more than 10 years, adding that it has received recognition and awards for the initiative. The General Manager, Corporate and Investment Banking, Mrs Mojisola Bakare, said, “It is very important that we take responsibility for our actions on the environment and preserve its beauty to boost the local economy and attract foreign tourists, and by extension, foreign exchange into the country.” Commissioner for Ministry of Tourism in Lagos State, Mrs Uzamat Yussuf, stressed the need for the citizenry to clean the beaches in a bid to encourage tourists and ultimately increase the GDP of the country. Abia State Commissioner of Transport, Mr Godswill Uwanoruo, commended the management and staff of Sterling Bank for the cleaning exercise which started in the state in 2015.
