Former Zambian President, Rupiah Banda, has died at 85 after suffering from colon cancer. Banda, who was Zambia’s fourth president, led the country from 2008 to 2011. He was the vice-president when in 2008, President Levy Mwanawasa, suffered a stroke and later died. After assuming office, he later won subsequent elections. In 2011, Banda lost the election to Michael Sata. He was widely praised at the time for accepting defeat, rather than challenging the result. Eulogizing the deceased, President Hakainde Hichilema said, “His life of service to our country, and to our continent, represents the highest form of patriotism.”
