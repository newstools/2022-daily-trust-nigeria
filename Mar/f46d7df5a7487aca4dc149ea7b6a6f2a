The chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State, Shehu Wada Sagagi, has said a former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido, and some aggrieved members of the Kwankwasiyya group want the dissolution of the state’s party executives for personal gains. Speaking to Daily Trust, Sagagi said since 1998 and up to 2017, Lamido had been trying to have political control of Kano. He said, “They just want to hold unto some political machinery so that they will be placing their cronies or children as if we are slaves. None of them can boast of winning his polling unit talk less of ward or local government or state.”
