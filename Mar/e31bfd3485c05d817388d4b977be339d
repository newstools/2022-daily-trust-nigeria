Chairman, National Governing Board of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Amb. Fatima Abubakar has charged the ventures department of the scheme to create more business ideas that will enable it generate more profits. Speaking to journalists, on Wednesday when she led the board members to inspect the bread bakery and water factory situated at the FCT camp, she said it was not proper for one to be in business yet making no profit. She said although they baked two different types of bread, they should diversify and make some other things such as pastries that would attract people and enable the business to make profit. She said there were various businesses, which the water factory could also tap from and improve its profits. Abubakar noted that there were other business ventures of the scheme across the country such as farms, garment-making factories amongst others, hence she pledged to support them to ensure the businesses succeed. She also urged corps members in camp to take their skills acquisition and entrepreneurial training seriously as that would make them job creators after their service year rather than seeking for white-collar jobs.
