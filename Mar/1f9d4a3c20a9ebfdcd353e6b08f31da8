A gun fight on Monday erupted between rival groups of armed bandits near Kunchin Kalgo community in Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Daily Trust gathered. A resident familiar with the matter identified as Sani Usman told City & Crime that the rival armed groups fought following a misunderstanding over sharing of rustled cows. “It was a market day in Kunchin Kalgo. Activities had picked up in the busy market when heavy gunshots suddenly rented the air. There was pandemonium as traders were struggling to scamper for safety. “A mobile phone hawker was hit by a stray bullet, and was later admitted in a medical facility. However, two of the armed criminals were shot dead in the fight. The market became nearly empty within a very short time,” the resident said. Some days ago, a motorbike-riding gang of armed criminals was spotted in Kunchin Kalgo village. The criminals clad in military uniform might have missed the road to their destination as they rode to Munhaye forest shortly after their arrival. Recently, Tsafe town and several other communities in the local government have witnessed spikes in the deadly assaults and kidnapping for ransom by the armed bandits. The spokesman of the state police command, SP Muhammad Shehu, could not be reached for comment as at the time of filing this report.
