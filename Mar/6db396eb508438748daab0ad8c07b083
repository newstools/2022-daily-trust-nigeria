A businessman, Monday Francis, on Thursday, begged a customary court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, not to grant his wife, Mercy, divorce, saying he still loves her and cannot let her go. Francis made the plea while defending himself in a divorce petition filed against him by Mercy. He told the court that, “I still love my wife very much. I don’t want her to leave me. She wants to divorce me by force. She has ganged up with some people who are instigating her against me and telling her to divorce me. I beg this honourable court not to grant her request.” The petitioner, Mercy, on the other hand, begged the court to grant her prayer on the grounds that she could not continue to live with him. She also told the court that her husband beats her and that she almost lost an eye due to the beatings. The judge, Labaran Gusau, urged the couple to explore an out-of-court settlement and adjourned the case to May 3. (NAN)
