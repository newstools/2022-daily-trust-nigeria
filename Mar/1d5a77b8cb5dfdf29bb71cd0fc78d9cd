Jaiz Bank Plc has opened another branch in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, commissioned the branch in Akure, urging everyone to patronise the bank as it is meant for both Muslims and non-Muslims. He said the coming of the premier non-interest bank in Nigeria to Ondo would open the doors for all to enjoy non-interest financing. “The bank is not for Muslims alone. I am not a Muslim. In fact, I am the chancellor of my own church and I am going to have an account in the state. “Over the last five years, we have made efforts to bring development to the state and today we are bringing in Jaiz Bank to the state. The state is under-banked. We need more,” the governor said. He urged civil servants in the state to transfer their salary accounts to Jaiz Bank so that they can take advantage of the bank’s mortgage facility. “There is no bank where you can get facility just after six months. Jaiz did this and I can say that if not the 8th then it is the 9th wonder of the world.” In his speech, the Managing Director of the bank, Mr. Hassan Usman, thanked the governor for his support towards the establishment of the bank in the state. Speaking on the mission of the bank which is ‘Making Life Better Through Ethical Finance’, the MD said Jaiz Bank is well-positioned to partner with MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) in various sectors of the economy in the state.
