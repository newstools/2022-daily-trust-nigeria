Various groups comprising of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), professionals, businessmen and support groups, on Thursday, stormed the headquarters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to buy presidential nomination forms for three aspirants. The aspirants are Sokoto State governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed, and a former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim. Some SANs and others purchased the forms for Tambuwal. They were led by Olumiyiwa Akinboro. Speaking to journalists, Akinboro described Tambuwal as a vibrant, young and popular politician that would take the country to the next level. He said, “He is strong, he is agile, he is intelligent and is focused. We have seen him demonstrate good leadership. One of the major things you see in leadership is humility. Somebody that sees himself even lower than the people he leads.” On their parts, the Bala Mohammed Vanguard (BMV), a political pressure group, led by its director general, Mohammed Jibo, extolled the virtues of the Bauchi governor, describing him as the most qualified person. Addressing journalists after picking the forms for Ayim, Comrade Mayor Samuel, leader of the coalition maintained that Anyim understood the peculiarity of the Nigerian system and had the capacity to provide solutions to the problems, and asked Nigerians to support him to lead the country.
