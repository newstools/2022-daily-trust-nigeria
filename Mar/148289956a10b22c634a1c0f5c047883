For the second time in four months, Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has issued resignation notice to all political appointees eyeing elective positions in next year’s election. Abiodun had in November directed political office holders in his administration with political ambition to resign on or before January 30 to pursue their dreams. The governor said the directive became expedient to avoid observed distractions and loss of focus in the discharge of their responsibilities. Daily Trust reports that the former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Akingbolahan Adeniran, resigned citing personal reasons; a former speaker, Hon. Olumuyiwa Oladipo, who was a consultant to the governor, quit to join the camp of former governor Ibikunle Amosun. Also, ace sports broadcaster and former Special Adviser to Abiodun on Communication, Modele Sarafa-Yusuf, also resigned her appointment and declared to contest for governorship in the 2023 election. But findings by our correspondent showed that some top appointees in Abiodun’s cabinet, including the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Tokunbo Talabi, the Chief of Staff, Shuab Salisu and the commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afoape, among others are eyeing one electoral office or the other ahead of the general elections. But despite the governor’s resignation notice, many top serving political appointees are still hanging on to their appointments. In a letter dated, February 26 signed by the SSG, the governor again told the appointees to officially register their intention at a special desk created in the office of the SSG before Wednesday, March 2.
