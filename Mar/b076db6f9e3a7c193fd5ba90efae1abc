The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) is calling for expeditious actions in developing gas infrastructure to meet the timeline for Nigeria’s energy transition. The Director General of ACCI, Victoria Akai, who made the call yesterday in Abuja, said the current conflict in Europe, which has led to energy crisis in the world, should serve as a warning to the government to ensure speedy development of the sector for Nigerians to obtain the commodity in ease and at cheap prices. Akai, during a press briefing, disclosed that the centre would organize a domestic gas summit next week, to aid the government on ways to handle the transition into gas consumption from fossil fuel. “This is an important area of focus that must be given attention by stakeholders across the various government and business spectrum. “The movement for energy transition is considered to be a global ideal. Within the context of the save the planet movement, countries in Africa are working to devise appropriate responses. “Across African capitals, the debate is on, as to what energy transition should mean for the peculiarities of each country,” Akai noted. She said with Nigeria not being a major contributor to global emission but pledged to reduce carbon emission under the Paris Agreement, the availability of gas in the country has made sustainable alternatives achievable. “The gas commercialization agenda, the auto-gas initiatives and other policy responses have provided much-needed answers for Nigeria’s need for energy transition.” The summit which is initiated by the Energy Trade Group of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is themed ‘Building a Sustainable Gas Economy’.
