The Kano/Jigawa Customs Area Command has generated N10.1 billion revenue in the first quarter of the year while seizing contrabands worth N498.6 million within the same period. The command’s Controller, Muhammad A. Umar, who disclosed this on Thursday, informed that he has directed that the Maigatari border in Jigawa State be fully optimised for activities to augment the revenue generation of the command. He said the N10.1bn generated in the first quarter was an improvement on the N7.6bn generated in the first quarter of 2021 and shows that the command is on track to surpass the N27bn total generation of 2021. Comptroller Umar said the “Command will continue to put in place necessary measures to improve on the collection with support from other units of the service”, as well as regularly engage with stakeholders on how to open up Kano for more business. He listed items seized as contrabands within the first quarter to include 3,712 donkey skin worth N416.3m in Duty Paid Value (DPV), 1,031 foreign rice at 50kg worth N29.8m, three bags of donkey penis worth N2m and second-hand cloth worth N9.8m, among others.
