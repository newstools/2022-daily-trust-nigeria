The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has said the agency is focusing on trade facilitation to ultimately drive economic growth, income and wealth creation. The agency further said trade facilitation through shipping would build capacity, generate employment opportunities and improve the standard of living of Nigerians. Speaking at the NIMASA special day at the ongoing 43rd Kaduna International Trade Fair, the Director General, Dr Bashir Jamoh, said Nigeria is better known for its energy mineral resources but also has other strategic mineral resources across the states. Jamoh, who was represented by the Deputy Director, Shipping Promotion, Engr Francis Odukuye, said despite the prevailing role of petroleum as a major foreign exchange earner, the Nigerian agricultural sector is the mainstay of the economy being the largest non-oil export revenue earner. President of the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), Alhaji Suleiman Aliyu, said NIMASA plays a very key role in facilitating trade activities between Nigeria and other countries.
