The Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) has said that the Lekki Deep Sea Port project is now over 80 per cent complete. The Commission said the information in the public space claiming the facility is now at 83 per cent completion is incorrect. A statement signed by Manji Yarling, the Acting Head, Media & Publicity, ICRC indicated that the “breakdown of the completion status show that: dredging and reclamation is at 90.93 per cent, quay walls at 87.3 per cent, breakwater at 82.74 per cent and landside infrastructure at 70 per cent, bringing to a total of 81.14 per cent.” “As regulators of all concession agreements entered into by the Federal Government of Nigeria, ICRC deems it imperative to clarify this information and present the correct figure,” it stated. According to the statement, the concessionaire, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Ltd, is working round the clock to ensure the project is completed on schedule. The project is expected to be completed in September 2022 and become operational in December 2022. It said on its part, the ICRC will continue to carry out its regulatory function to ensure that this project, like all other government concessions, will yield the desired value for money, profitability, efficiency, economic growth, job creation and other gains for which the contract was entered into. The Lekki Deep Sea Port project is a 45 years concession by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) awarded on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Upon completion, Lekki Port will have a total of three container berths, one dry bulk berth and three liquid berths.
