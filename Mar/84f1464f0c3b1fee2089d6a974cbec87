A commercial motorcyclist in Dei-dei, a suburb of Abuja, identified as Abdurrashid Saidu, was found dead in the area after taking some people as passengers in the early hours of Monday. Grandfather of the deceased, Shuaibu Muhammad, said the victim went into a filling station in the area around 3am where he spent about an hour in a queue. “As he was leaving the vicinity, some people stopped him to take them somewhere. It was later in the morning that my attention was called, that his remains were sighted along the expressway, while the motorcycle was nowhere to be seen,’’ he narrated. Muhammed said the deceased has since been buried. The bereaved father lamented that even as he was struggling to come to terms with the death, the owner of the motorcycle was insisting that he must pay for the motorcycle which was sold to the deceased’s master through a hire-purchase arrangement. “I told him that my son had been killed because of the motorcycle and as such he can go to any court and demand for the money, while I demand his soul from him,’’ he said.
