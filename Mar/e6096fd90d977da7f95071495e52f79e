The Management of Central Bank of Nigeria has sensitised the public on its various interventions and initiatives, saying its interventions helped beat down the inflation level in the country. The CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele who spoke in Yola yesterday at the 2022 Central Bank of Nigeria Fair with the theme ‘Promoting Financial Stability and Economic development’ said the session was held to interact with Nigerians from all walks of life about the various programs of the apex bank. Represented by the Director, Corporate Communications,  Osita Nwanisobi, the governor argued that CBN’s agricultural interventions played a major role in bringing down inflation level since the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic.. “What we are doing will hopefully bring inflation down. During the global pandemic that turned into an economic crisis, we saw what happened across the global economy. We saw global shutdown and supply chain disruptions. We noticed inflation rose above 18% but through anchor borrower especially the intervention in maize and rice, it then started trending down because of these interventions, especially in the agric space”, he said. He therefore advised Nigerians to be wary of unlicensed people who market financial services to unsuspecting members of the public, urging them to always seek verification from local branches of CBN. He said the programme was organised to interact with and sensitise the public about the bank’s policies, interventions and initiatives to enhance their economic well being. The Yola Branch Controller of CBN, Sanusi Sah Nyashi commended the CBN management for holding this year’s fair in Adamawa and Taraba, urging the participants to take advantage of the opportunity.
