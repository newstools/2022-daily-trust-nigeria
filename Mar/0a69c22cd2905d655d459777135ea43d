Absence of identity and proper structure as a result of non-implementation of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Civil Service Commission rules will not allow any worker under the FCT Administration (FCTA) to rise to the position of permanent secretary. The chairman of the Joint Unions Action Committee (JUAC), Comrade Mutilukuro M. Oluwakorede, who made this known at the second JUAC Week with the theme: “Dignity in Labour”, said that was why permanent secretaries were being posted to the FCTA instead of being appointed from among the staff of the FCTA. Comrade Oluwakorede explained that, “And when they are posted, they will start to treat the workers, including the directors, like slaves. This can only be addressed if the FCT Civil Service Commission as stipulated in the act since 2018 is implemented.’’ Oluwakorede also frowned at the welfare package, as well as training of the FCTA workers, and called for urgent interventions. He, however, commended the FCTA for paying salary as at when due, as well as the payment of promotion areas for 2016, 2017 and 2018. He further said, “We commend the administration for its policy on immediate employment of bereaved staff spouses to take care of their children.’’ Earlier, the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, represented by the permanent secretary, Adesola Olusade, reiterated the administration’s commitment to see to the welfare of the staff through trainings, regular promotion, prompt salary payment, among others.
