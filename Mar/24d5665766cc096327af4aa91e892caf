One woman and two men were reportedly  abducted during the raid. The residents also said farmers were kidnapped from their fields a week ago and requested for a military checkpoint alone the Chikuku road leading to Kwali, which they said has been the entry point for the kidnappers. The youth leader of the community, Yakubu Danjuma, said they embarked on the protest because there was no week that passed without an incident of abduction by in the community, adding that some residents had been forced to relocate.
