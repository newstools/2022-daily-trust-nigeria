Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) has said it will partner with the Chinese Communist Party on global best practices, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The IPAC national chairman, Engr. Yabagi Yusuf Sani, said this on Thursday in Abuja, when he received a delegation from the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mr Wu Baocai. According to him, the council’s primary mandate was to promote and sustain intra-party harmony among political parties as well as enhance internal cohesion and sanity within them. He said IPAC also worked towards enhancing understanding and synergies between the three democratic organs – legislature, the judiciary and the executive. He also said IPAC was excited by the phenomenal feat achieved by the Chinese Communist Party over the years, as evidenced in its leadership and guidance of 1.4 billion population of divergent ethnic backgrounds and communities toward unity. “We are however convinced that, while building a model of democracy rooted in their peculiar history, textures and characteristics, there is so much that Nigeria and countries in Africa can learn from the exemplary strides of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. Responding, Baocai said Nigeria and China had been allies for long and should continue to strengthen the political and economic relationship between them. He expressed hope that the co-operation between the two countries, its peoples, political organisations and many more co-operations would continue for an enhanced relationship for better life of both countries.
