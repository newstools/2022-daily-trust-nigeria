The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has ordered MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN), owners of GOtv and DStv, to create a feature that allows its customers to lock their subscription for a minimum of one year. FCCPC said this was part of a resolution reached after an investigation it launched in 2020 on the company over complaints of abuse of dominant position in the pay-per-view subscription. In a statement signed by its director, legal services, Tam Tamunokonbia, FCCPC also directed MCN to allow subscribers to suspend their subscription four times annually, which it currently offered for a fixed period between seven and 14 days twice yearly. The statement reads in part: “It should guarantee a price lock option that allows subscribers to maintain the same subscription fee for a minimum period of one year subject to a contractual agreement that clearly specifies the applicable terms.” The commission also urged MCN to communicate to each subscriber regarding all channels available within their selected bouquet option and completely toll-free customer service lines to be operational 24 hours daily. The commission further urged MCN to provide it with a report on challenges to operate the new guidelines, as well as submit a compliance report demonstrating full compliance of the order, warning that violation of an order of the commission would attract a fine of N5m.
