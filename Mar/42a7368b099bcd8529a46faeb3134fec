The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) says the global DevOps market is expected to reach $57.9 billion by 2030 and Nigerian startups can only benefit from it if they build their capacity adequately. The director-general of the NITDA, Kashifu Abdullahi, stated this on Thursday in Abuja during the opening ceremony of a workshop on ‘Building Lean and Agile Products with DevOps’, organised by the Office for Nigerian Digital Innovation (ONDI) in collaboration with Lotus Beta Analytics Nigeria Limited. Abdullahi, represented by the Acting Director of Digital Economy Development Department (DEDD), NITDA, Salisu Kaka, said: “The global DevOps market size was valued at US$6.78 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach US$57.9 billion by 2030. “Therefore, this collaboration is apt and timely in ensuring that our startups benefit from the DevOps market growth.” According to him, the workshop was aimed at supporting vibrant and innovative startups to build capacities to scale their businesses through modernisation of legacy solutions, migration of on-premises business solutions to the cloud, development of cloud applications and driving exponential revenue growth. He charged participants to make use of the opportunity to tap into the growing DevOps market by ensuring that all learnings are translated into meaningful use to scale their businesses and contribute to the nation’s economic growth.
