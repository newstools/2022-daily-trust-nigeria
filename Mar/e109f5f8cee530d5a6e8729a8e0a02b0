The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their failure to give Nigerians good governance. The party’s stand is coming on the heels of the attack by the presidency on Tuesday that PDP wants to destabilize Nigeria. But in its reaction, the opposition party said, “If there is anybody seeking to destabilize our nation, it is the sinking, confused and discomfited APC that is clutching to straws and making unguarded statements including boasting that “heavens will not fall” over its refusal to address the lingering fuel crisis.” A statement by Debo Ologunagba, national publicity secretary of the party, said from the outburst of the Presidency, Nigerians now realize that the APC administration does not care about the suffering, agony and life discounting experiences encountered by our citizens daily as a result of APC’s inhumane policies. The “APC administration is afraid because its corruption, impunity and recklessness which are responsible for the biting petrol and diesel crises, collapsed national grid, distressed aviation sector, plummeting currency and near collapse of the production and service sectors of the economy are being exposed by the PDP. “APC is afraid of Nigerians for bungling the once-thriving $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) handed over to it by the PDP in 2015 and reducing our nation to the poverty capital of the world where over 80 million citizens, according to official reports, can no longer afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life,” PDP said.
