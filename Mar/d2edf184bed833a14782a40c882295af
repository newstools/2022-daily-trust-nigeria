A Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo, the Taraba State Capital, Tuesday, set aside the election of Taraba State All Progressives Congress (APC) which was conducted on Oct 24, 2021. The presiding judge, Justice Simon Amobeda, while delivering judgement on a case filed by some aggrieved members of the party over the processes that led to the elections, said the defendants had violated the guidelines of such elections as enshrined in the political party’s constitution. He further stated that they had also gone ahead to conduct the election against the court order which was given to them prior to the election restraining them from conducting it. Reacting to the judgement, counsel to the defendant, Barr. John Odekena, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgement and vowed to approach the appeal court after consulting his client. However, commenting on the judgement, Barr. Joy Ezekiel, counsel to the plaintiffs said the defendants had among others failed to officially notify the members of the said election 24 hours before the date of the election as stipulated in the guidelines of the party. She expressed satisfaction with the judgment, stating that justice had prevailed at the end of a battle that started last year.
