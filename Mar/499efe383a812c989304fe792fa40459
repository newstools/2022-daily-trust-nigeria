Dancing is one of the scientific ways to lose calories, the Chief Executive Officer of Krump Dance Studio, Jemima Angulu, has said. She stated this at the weekend in Abuja during an event tagged, ‘Fit2dance, Fit2live’, organized in collaboration with Transcorp Hilton Hotel, and other partners. According to her, dancing is the best form of exercise for beginners and those above 40. She said the three-hour dance was initiated in 2012 to bring dance fitness to the public to enable it to be a lifestyle for people, adding, “People know they need to be fit, but sometimes it’s tasking mentally going to the gym. So, we use this as an opportunity to tell them there are alternatives.” Angulu said dancing for at least 30 minutes a day is a fun form of aerobic exercise that helps burn fat cells, especially around the stomach, thighs and generally all over the body.
