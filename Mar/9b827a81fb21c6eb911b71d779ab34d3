A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has said that he didn’t see anything wrong with politicians decamping from one party to another, saying that is usual with the political system. The two-term governor said it is even wiser when a politician changed to another party to test his popularity and acceptance amongst the people. Kwankwaso spoke in Kano, Sunday, while holding a meeting with members of the Kwankwasiyya movement, and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus of the state in his Miller Road residence. “Staying or leaving a particular party is not bad in the game of politics. In fact, that is to show that you know politics very well and can cope with all its challenges,” he said. He recalled that in 2018 after the PDP’s presidential convention in Port Harcourt, the four of them who came first, second, third and fourth, all left the party and later came back to the PDP. Kwankwaso added that although he is still in PDP, he would decamp very soon to the New Nigeria Progressive Party (NNPP) since his present party is also witnessing serious crises that are difficult to resolve. “Although APC is the most disappointing party presently in Nigeria, they are almost in the same shoe with the PDP, as it is the party where your right and freedom can be taken for granted. “No matter how qualitative you are, there are some unprofessional [people] there to bring you down and deprive you of your right,” he lamented. Daily Trust had last week reported that uncertainty and confusion have trailed the revelation by Senator Kwankwaso of his plan to dump the PDP at the end of the month with some of his followers saying they will not follow him. He was also reported to have said the APC and PDP have nothing to show Nigerians to get reelected in the coming 2023 elections.
