Some fufu sellers in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, have called on government to provide them with equipment to facilitate cassava processing and boost their businesses. The fufu sellers made the call on Monday in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Mararaba, Nasarawa State. Mrs Mary Aigbe, a popular cassava seller in Angwe Doka community in Mararaba, said she ventured into the cassava business in 2002. She said the business has helped her to take care of her family, even though she still runs it as a small-scale business. “The business wasn’t profitable when I started due to lack of funds to purchase cassava in large quantities. ”But now, with the proceeds I have gathered from the business, I now buy in large quantities and lack of storage equipment has now become a major challenge. ”With adequate equipment, I will be able to process more fufu and that means more sales and more profit,” she said. Miss Victoria Izehi, another fufu seller, said the lack of equipment is discouraging youths from coming into the business, adding that she trained herself through school with the proceeds from fufu business. Izehi said provision of equipment like pounding and peeling machines would go a long way in boosting production. (NAN)
