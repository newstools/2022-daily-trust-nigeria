Oasis Management Company (OMC) has availed upcoming technology innovators the opportunity to improve their technology solution projects to full establishments through the Oasis Innovation Challenge (OIC). Speaking over the weekend in Abuja at the grand finale event of the annual software innovation challenge, Head of the Oasis Innovation Centre, Mr Charles Ofoefula said winners of the six months innovation challenge would have the opportunity to undergo mentorship programmes to improve on their project’s, enjoy partnership in solution development and delivery as well as gain exposure to potential investors who would invest in their projects. He explained that some of the innovators who applied for the challenge do not have their apps in existence as they were just ideas yet to develop, while some other innovators had an existing app solution that needed to grow. Ofoefula noted that the first prize winner of the challenge, team DOVILEARN had an existing app in the education and learning category where it provides solutions for virtual learning at any educational level, hence they were rewarded with the sum of one million naira. The second prize winner, team REGXTA had an already existing app in microfinance where it takes banking activities to low market women and small business owners who do not have the opportunity to access loans and save money in the banks, hence they walked away with five hundred thousand naira. For the third prize winner, team GBALE.NG, he said they also had an already existing platform where it provides property solutions for tenants and landlords as well, noting that they were rewarded with the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand naira. On his part, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Oasis Management Company, Mr Maduka Emelife said 44 entries were recorded in the competition from 52 cities in Nigeria. 21 were shortlisted, hence only three top winners amongst all the competitors emerged.
