A group under the umbrella of Ekpeye Mandate has called on a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Prince Chibudom Nwuche, to contest for the governorship of Rivers State in 2023. Leader of the group, Comrade Okolobia Franklin, who spoke during a courtesy visit to Nwuche at his Ochigba residence in Ahoada East LGA of Rivers State, said they found Nwuche most credible and worthy to take over the affairs of state among all those who had indicated interest to contest. Okolobia, who was quoted in a statement, said as part of the mobilization plans, the group has commenced consultations with other ethnic groups in Rivers, adding that the candidature of Nwuche has received tremendous and overwhelming support from across the state. He emphasised that Nwuche’s acceptance to heed the clarion call will no doubt deepen the development of Rivers State. Also speaking, the secretary of the group, Comrade Fredrick Williams, said the group which spreads across political divides, has the network to mobilize Rivers people for the realization of the agenda. Responding, Nwuche thanked the group for the visit and promised to further consult with the stakeholders in the party under the leadership of the governor, Nyesom Wike, as he is a team player.
