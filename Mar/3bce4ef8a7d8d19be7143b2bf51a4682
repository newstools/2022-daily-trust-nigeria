The National Chairman of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has declared his intention to contest for the presidency come 2023. Sowore said that he would run a socialist government focusing on workers’ welfare, free education, job creation, and pension reform. He made this known on Tuesday in Abuja while declaring his ambition to run for the position of Nigeria’s president in the 2023 general elections. According to him “Nigerian workers, a living wage is coming your way. What I am saying to you is that an N100,000 monthly minimum wage is too small for Nigerian workers today. “Last time we promised N100,000 as a minimum wage but they were telling us that it would cause inflation but Senators are collecting N14million per month it did not cause inflation. “Snake swallowed N36billion somewhere it did not cause inflation. “Nigerian students, help is coming your way because we will give you free and qualitative education with bursary, grants, and scholarships. “To the unemployed young people of Nigeria, I can only promise you one thing – jobs. I am also going to reform the pension system.”  He also vowed to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and a Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho) from detention if he becomes the President of Nigeria in 2023. The AAC Chairman warned those in government at present to make efforts to rehabilitate custodial centres across the country, saying they would likely spend some time there after their tenure. “As soon as I am sworn in on June 12, 2023, I will release all political detainees, particularly Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho. “People who are asking for self-determination should not go to prison. Those in the Diaspora must also be given the right to vote during the election. “We will not encourage those who put them in prison, they should be rehabilitating prisons now because they may have to spend some time there as well,” Sowore said.
