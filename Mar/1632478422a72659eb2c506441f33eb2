One of the top contenders for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairmanship, Malam Saliu Mustapha, has asked all party members and leaders to build on President Muhammadu Buhari’s progressive ideals and sustain his legacies after his exit from power in 2023. President Buhari had asked all party bigwigs to exercise caution sequel to the acrimony and conflict of interests bedevilling the party ahead of its national convention in order not to lose power like it happened to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement yesterday in Abuja, by his media aide, Dapo Okubanjo, Mustapha said Buhari’s message showed that he was willing to bequeath a strong party that would stand the test of time for Nigeria. “This is exactly why we have been running a decent campaign devoid of mudslinging or any attempt to throw brickbats at anyone for exercising their right to compete for the party’s top job. “For us, the race for the position of national chairman is not a contest for titles but of ideas and as such we have always used every opportunity to reaffirm our intention to birth an idea that was mooted in the past but was never realized; The Progressives Institute (TPI). “Let us again reaffirm that APC remains the party of choice for Nigerians and under our watch, we will sustain the Buhari legacy and institutionalise the party as a haven for progressive ideals,” he said.
