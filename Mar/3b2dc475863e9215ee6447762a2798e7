Members of the State Working Committee (SWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been inaugurated seven months after their emergence following protracted legal battle between factions of the party in the state. Daily Trust had reported that after the state congresses of the party, two executive committees emerged in the state. One of the committees was enjoying the support of a former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko (APC, Sokoto North), while the other was backed by Senator Abubakar Gada. The Abuja High Court had earlier affirmed Mainasara Sani of the Gada-backed faction as the substantive chairman of the party in the state. However, the judgement was set aside by the appellant court on Friday over lack of jurisdiction. It was in view of this that the national headquarters of the party swore in Isa Achida of the Wamakko-backed faction as the substantive chairman of the party in the state last Saturday and directed him to swear in other members of the executive committee in the state. Shortly after the swearing-in ceremony at the state party secretariat on Monday, Achida extended a hand of fellowship to all members of the other faction. It would be recalled that the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami SAN, had while attending a programme in Sokoto, described Mainasara as the authentic chairman of the party.
