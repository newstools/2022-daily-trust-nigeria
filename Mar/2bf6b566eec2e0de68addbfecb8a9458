 In a boost to the country’s auto policy and the assembling prowess of indigenous auto manufacturers, Geely Nigeria, the exclusive partnership between Mikano International and Geely Autos, is set to launch a brand new SUV, findings by Daily Trust revealed. Though the brand is still being kept under wraps, the partnership has concluded the plans, banking on the successes recorded in the previous brands it has birthed including X7 Sport, Emgrand 7 and Coolray. Leveraging Mikano International’s formidable legacy, Mikano Motors launched Geely Nigeria with the introduction of the X7Sport and Emgrand7 models with laudable success. This was quickly followed by the launch of the Coolray SUV, which won the award for “Best Compact SUV- Design and Technology 2021”, by the Nigerian Auto Journalists Association (NAJA). Insiders say Mikano Motors-Geely Nigeria, is poised to shake up the Nigerian auto- industry once again with this innovative, game- changing addition. What we do know so far is that the new entrant is a C- Segment, hybrid SUV, with no limit to the luxury, technology and safety that Geely is renowned for. This SUV, like the Coolray before it, was co- developed with Volvo Autos, which Geely took ownership of in 2010.
