Energy expert and retired deputy director of the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources, Engr Sunday Adebayo Babalola, has lauded the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) for withdrawing the adulterated petrol from circulation and easing the fuel queues nationwide. Babalola who is a director of All Grace Energy in an interview yesterday said, “It is a very good development. I must commend the federal government and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited for the efforts they have put in to be able to bring about this restoration of fuel supply and prevent further fuel scarcity,” he said. Beginning from late January 2022, cases of about 100 million litres of adulterated petrol became rampant across retail stations with reports of damage to vehicles. NNPCL which had imported the petrol withdrew it and imported fresh product just as queues mounted across retail stations nationwide due to the distribution gap. The queues have cleared in Lagos and some states but are visible in the northern states. But Babalola noted that the situation was compounded by the Ukraine-Russian crisis. He said: “In spite of the trial and confusion going on in the world, including the Ukraine-Russian war, we are still able to get fuel into the petrol stations and people are able to buy without queues.” Speaking on the adulterated petrol, Babalola said it was a case of wrong mixing of methanol in the procured petrol.
