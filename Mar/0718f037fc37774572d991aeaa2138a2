A suspected female ritualist was on Thursday nabbed by residents of Kulende community, Zango area, Ilorin, Kwara State. A resident, Mr Kudus, said the suspect was currently being held at the state Criminal Investigations Department (CID). According to him, the woman, who pretended to have mental health issues, had been living in a shanty on the roadside for years. He alleged that members of the community became suspicious of her activities when she was sighted giving some items suspected to be human parts to a motorist in a jeep parked near her abode in the middle of the night. Mr Kudus explained that before members of the vigilante in the community got near enough to find out what she was giving to the jeep driver, the occupants zoomed off. He noted that when the community leaders ransacked the shanty as well as her luggage, a large sum of money, a knife, a bottle of water, as well as a complete set of children’s school uniform, bag, shoes and books were found. Mr Kudus maintained that when queried, the woman could not explain how she got the items in her possession. The Kwara State Police Command confirmed the incident. Its spokesman, Ajayi Okasanmi, said efforts are on to arrest the fleeing driver, adding that the money found with her in different denominations totalled N166,700. “The suspect stated that the man with jeep came to have sex with her and to give her water. “The Commissioner of Police, Tuesday Assayamo, has ordered a discreet investigation into the matter and also directed the suspect be taken to the hospital to ascertain her mental health,” he added.
