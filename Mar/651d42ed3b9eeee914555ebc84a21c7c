 A former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has said he did not engage in any battle to get political power. He said political power rather “chased” him until he could no longer run. Obasanjo spoke at the weekend in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during a symposium organised by the national leadership of the Keggites Club of Nigeria through the Unity in Diversity Forum. He explained that as a trained soldier, he was reluctant to join politics from the beginning. The lecture, which was held at the auditorium of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) was part of activities to celebrate the 85th birthday of the former president, who is the Eternal Grand Patron of the Kegite Club. Obasanjo said “I was once reluctant to be in political power. I was trained as a soldier. One of my training is that soldiering and politics don’t go together and I stuck to that. “But power started chasing me and I ran, I ran and ran until I could not run out of the reach of power. I believed that without been immodest, the fact that I was not looking for power and power was looking for me make a drought of business.”
