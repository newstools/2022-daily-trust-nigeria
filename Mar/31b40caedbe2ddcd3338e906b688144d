Speaking on the benefits, Onafowokan explained that Nigeria as a whole would benefit from Coleman’s access to alternative funding at a better rate. He continued, “Coleman being able to increase its capacity and efficiency and make cables more affordable for Nigerians as a whole would affect the market positively.
