The Sokoto State government has given civil servants who are aspiring to contest in the forthcoming elections 24 hours to resign from their positions. A statement dated March 7, 2022 signed by the head of service in the state, Abubakar Muhammad, hinged the decision on the amended electoral act. A desk officer has been appointed in the office of the head of service for the purpose. The desk officer, who was later contacted by our reporter, said he would confirm the decision at the office and call back which was not done up to the time of filing this report. However, a lawyer in the state, Muhammad Nuhu, said the head of service had gotten it wrong because Section 84(12) of the new electoral act was only referring to political appointees, not civil servants. “So the provision is not targeting at civil servants but political appointees,” he said However, the state Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress, Aminu Umar Ahmed, said they were still studying the circular to understand it content before making their stand known. When contacted, the head of service said their decision was in line with the new electoral law. On the assertion that the new electoral act targets only political appointees, he said “we have to play safe.”
