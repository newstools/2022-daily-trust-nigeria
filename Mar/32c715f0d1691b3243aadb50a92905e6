Some National Executive Committee (NEC) members, supporters of a former governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff and those of a former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, have endorsed Senator George Akume as national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of next week’s national convention. Akume, a former Governor of Benue State and current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs is one of the top contenders for the office of APC’s national chairman. The party had zoned the office of national chairman to the North Central where Akume hails from, while the North East zone where Sheriff and Yuguda hail from, has been zoned out of the chairmanship race. A statement on Monday in Abuja, signed by the Coordinator South, Chief Ray Morphy, on behalf of the George Akume Campaign Organisation, said three political support groups known as Senator Ali Modu Sheriff Nationalist Movement and Mallam Isa Yuguda Support Organisation have also met on March 12, 2022 at Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Tomb in Bauchi to declared their support for Senator George Akume.
