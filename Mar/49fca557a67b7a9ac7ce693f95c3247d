The All Progressives Congress (APC) youth from Benue North-West Senatorial district have drummed up support for Senator George Akume for the party’s top job in the forthcoming convention slated for March 26. Leader of the youth Comrade Asor Aondohemba Jeremiah, who made the call yesterday in Abuja, said though they are not unaware of the emergence of a consensus candidate, they still hope it was going to favour Sen. Akume. They also called on the party’s members and supporters to join hands with other stakeholders to support and ensure the emergence of Akume as the national chairman of the ruling APC. Meanwhile, the national coordinator of Senator Abdullahi Adamu Campaign Organization, Lawrence Nwachukwu, said the former governor of Nasarawa State is the most qualified person to pilot the affairs of the party. Nwachukwu, while addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, said members of the organization are convinced that from Senator Adamu’s background, he has the capacity and capability to tackle the challenges facing the party. But members of the APC on the platform of APC Muslim Integrity Forum (APCMIF) have rejected the endorsement of Adamu, as the next national chairman of the ruling party. Adamu has been reportedly endorsed by President Buhari ahead of the APC national convention slated for March 26. But addressing a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja, national coordinator of the forum, Hon. Abubakar Yusuf, said the lawmaker was not qualified to run the party.
