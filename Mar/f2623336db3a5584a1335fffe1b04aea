The Nasrul Lahi-L-Fatih Society (NASFAT) says it would open a cottage industry that will basically deal with the value-chains of palm kernel for teeming unemployed youths in the country. The society, owner of Fountain University, Osogbo, also launched a fundraising scheme worldwide for its proposed 2.5 billion mosque structures located on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Chief Missioner of NASFAT, Alh. Abdul-Azeez Onike, who disclosed this in an interview with Daily Trust in Abuja on Sunday, said the mission board of the society will work towards achieving the industry project before December 2022. He said, ‘’We have made efforts to create an industry in the past. We have not foreclosed our efforts in establishing industries that will employ teeming unemployed youths of the country. “In sha Allah, the mission board is looking at setting up a cottage industry in the country very soon before the end of the year. The mission board, as an organ of the society, is planning the cottage industry.
