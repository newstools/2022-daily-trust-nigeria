Stakeholders under the aegis of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) have advised the incoming governor of Anambra State, Prof. Charles Soludo, to address the issue of religious politics in the state. A member of the National Advisory Board of PFN, Bishop Paul Nkwachukwu, made the appeal during the weekend at the Alaigbo sunrise prayer crusade held in Awka, Anambra State.

The bishop, who described Soludo as God-sent to rescue the state from its numerous challenges, added that addressing religious politics in the land would take the state to a greater height. Nkwachukwu, who is the founder and bishop of Grace of God Mission, said Anambra State has over the years been enmeshed in religious denominational politics which was not healthy for the state. “Religious politics is one of the major problems in the state and there is a need to address it frontally. I know that Soludo will address it,” he said.
