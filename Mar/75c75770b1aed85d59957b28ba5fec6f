The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) has said the number of foreign medical companies that have shown interest to establish world-class hospitals and pharmaceutical industries in the new Special Medical Free Zone in Lekki area of Lagos would lead to the gradual end of medical tourism abroad. The Managing Director of NEPZA, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, made the remark while playing host to officials of two foreign hospital management companies, Citizens Health Limited and Brown Brommel Medicals, which want to invest in world-class hospitals for cancer and kidney respectively.

He however said the newly approved special medical zone was attracting expected attention as the authority is prepared to relax stringent rules to ensure the comfort of anchor tenants. “The Special Medical Zone in Lekki will be competitive as we are working toward the concentration of world-class hospitals there. We are searching for anchor tenants to drive this revolution. “Already, scores of prospective investors have come knocking on our door. So you are welcome to collaborate with us.” Prof Adesugba also explained that investors should expect similar zones in Katsina and Ilorin. Vice President of Brown Brommel Medicals, Mr Brain Barnes, said the company had come to explore the possibility of setting up of an advanced Modern Integrated Diagnostic and Dialysis Centre at the zone, adding that the centre, proposed to sit on 10 hectares of land, would also provide sundry medical services.
