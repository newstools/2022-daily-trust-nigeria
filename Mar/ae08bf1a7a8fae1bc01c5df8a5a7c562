A former captain of the Super Eagles, Joseph Yobo and some youth leaders across the country have unveiled the Grassroots Mobilization Initiative (GMI) on Monday in Abuja. According to them, GMI has been designed to provide a platform for galvanizing the support of Nigerian youths into mass action that will ensure that only credible candidates assume power in 2023 across the country, especially the presidency.
