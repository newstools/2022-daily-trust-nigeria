The chairman of the FCT wing of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Stephen Knabayi, has said the union will not call off its ongoing strike by primary school teachers in three area councils until their arrears are paid. City & Crime had reported that primary school teachers in Kwali, Kuje and Bwari area councils continued their strike even though those in Abaji, Gwagwalada and AMAC called off after the council authorities met the demand of the teachers in the areas. 2 nabbed for robbing sugarcane seller of N45,000 Varsity don, 4 others kidnapped in Edo Speaking through telephone with our reporter yesterday, Mr Knabayi said the intervention of the FCT permanent secretary between the union and affected council chairmen last week ended in a deadlock. He said there was no serious commitment from the chairmen of Kwali, Kuje and Bwari to pay the arrears of its members. Mr Knabayi said, “The FCT permanent secretary summoned a meeting between us and the ALGON in his office last week. There was no sign of serious commitment from the three area councils to pay teachers’ arrears. “At the meeting, the Bwari area council chairman said he would pay N10m, but we rejected that, while that of Kuje area council was directed to come with the template by the permanent secretary on how he intends to pay the arrears.”
