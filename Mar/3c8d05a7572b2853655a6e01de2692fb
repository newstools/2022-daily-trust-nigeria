The chairman, Council of All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders in Nasarawa State, Dr Kassim Muhammed Kassim, has said they raised N10 million from stakeholders in the North-Central to buy nomination and expression of interest form for Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The former Nasarawa State governor is vying for the post of the national chairman at the APC national convention. President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly endorsed him as a candidate. Kassim told journalists in Lafia that the rationale behind the contribution was to show solidarity to Adamu and a way of saying ‘thank you’ for establishing high institutions in the state during his time as governor, which enabled them to acquire higher education. He urged those who claimed to be supporters of the president and opposed his choice to have a re-think.
