A political analyst and lecturer at the Department of Political Science, Bayero University Kano (BUK), Dr Sa’id Ahmad Dukawa, has said political parties are crippling the country’s democracy. The analyst and current affairs commentator was reacting to the recent national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying it was not conducted towards the assurance of good governance and the future of democracy. He stated this while featuring on a local radio programme, Barka Da Hantsi, aired by Freedom Radio in Kano State. “The way and manner our politicians and political parties are running the system are no doubt crippling the democracy in the country especially looking at how a winner of a particular election comes to be known even before the election is conducted. “We have seen in many instances that those in power are winning back their seats and also determining who will inherit them or who will win what seat of power. The due processes and the democratic settings are not in any way taken into consideration. This will not but destroy the democracy,” he said.
