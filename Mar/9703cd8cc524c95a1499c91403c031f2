A Kaduna State governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Isa Mohammed Ashiru, has pledged to salvage the state from insecurity, poverty and unemployment if elected governor in 2023. Ashiru, who was the flag bearer of the PDP in the 2019 general elections, was defeated by the incumbent governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai. Speaking when he formally declared his intention to run for the governorship position, he lamented the level of insecurity, poverty and unemployment in the state. He had earlier inaugurated his campaign team, calling on them not to shy away from asking for whatever they needed to make the campaign a success. “The task before us, therefore, is to salvage our dear Kaduna State, reunite the people and move the state forward. We are going to attach priority to security, education, agriculture, health as well as women and youth empowerment, information technology, rural development and inclusiveness in governance, among others. “I believe that if given the ticket, we would all work together to win the gubernatorial election come February 2023 so that the PDP government can rescue the state from the current frightening situation. We have done it before and we will do it again,” he said.
