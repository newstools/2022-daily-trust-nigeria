The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it will take over Abia which is currently under the control of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the 2023 general elections. The party said it would equally take over Anambra state in the 2025 governorship election. APC only controls Ebonyi and Imo states in the Southeast currently. Enugu and Abia states are controlled by the PDP while the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) rules in Anambra State. Addressing newsmen on Thursday in Abuja, the newly elected APC National Vice Chairman (South-East), Dr Ijeomah Arodiogbu, said he would leave no stone unturned in reconciling aggrieved stalwarts of the party in the South-East geopolitical zone. He said: “In 2023, we expect election victory in the South-East. “My job is to deepen the stronghold of the party in the whole of the South-East. “And I know the stakeholders that recommended me and ensure that I emerged know that I have the ability and the wherewithal and strategy to deliver more success for APC in the whole of South-East. “We target at least to take more states. The important thing is that most of the political leaders and opinion leaders in the South-East are already in APC. “These potentials have to be put together to yield movement and build victory for the party. And I have the ability to do so and I have started. “We will achieve more. If I don’t get more states for APC in the South-East, I will feel that I have failed. “So, we will get more states. We will take over more. And they are willing to join because the PDP governors in those states are not doing well. “So, we will bring good candidates and win the remaining states.”
