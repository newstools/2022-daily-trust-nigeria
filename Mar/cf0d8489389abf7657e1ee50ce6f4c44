The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has called for the implementation of the Designated Export Warehouse (DEW) project to end multiple cargo examinations and boost the nation’s export volumes. The PEBEC Secretary and Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, made the call on Monday in Abuja, at a session on the Midway National Action Plan (NAP) 7.0. She said the session was pivotal for the trajectory of the 7th iteration of the 60 days accelerator NAP 7.0, especially on the progress of the Non-Agro and Agro export plans. She said the essence of NAP 7.0 was to ensure increased volume of exports and volume of foreign exchange in the country. On his part, PEBEC Technical Lead, Mr David Uzosike, while presenting the NAP 7.0 Agro-Export Reforms Midway Progress Report, said the implementation of DEW project will also encourage priority and free movement of designated export container-laden trucks. He said the move will also lead to a drastic reduction in current time for export cargo examination as well as congestion at the terminals and create space for new containers. Uzosike, who stressed the need to allow exporters to have free access to their foreign exchange, also called for an increase in the volume of exports regulators to work with terminal operators to prioritise exports and enhance process efficiency. He called for the audit and streamlining of the current physical inspection process for agro-exports, publishing and enforcement of the official timeline to drastically reduce the current time for export cargo examination.
