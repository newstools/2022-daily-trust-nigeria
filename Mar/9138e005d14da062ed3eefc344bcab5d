The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to address the avalanche of challenges facing Nigerians. The party, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said the numerous challenges in the country if not nipped in the bud could result in serious agitations and chaos in the land. “Our party fears that the situation is getting to a boiling point and can trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 EndSARS if not addressed immediately. “President Buhari must take responsibility. He should stop abdicating his duties by sending his aides to issue wild claims, fake promises and noncommittal apologies for the abysmal failures of his administration. “Sadly today, thousands of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, the drivers of the economy, are folding up daily; industries are relocating to neighbouring countries, universities are on strike, the aviation sector is on the brink of collapse, our railway is tottering to a halt due to lack of diesel, police are threatening to go on strike, insecurity is on the rise due to the collapse of the informal economic sector, yet Mr. President had time to holiday in England,” the PDP said.
