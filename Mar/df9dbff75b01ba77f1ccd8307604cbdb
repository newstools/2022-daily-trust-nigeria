The House of Representatives on Wednesday urged the federal government to construct rail tracks in Lekki Free Trade Zone to link Dangote Refineries and other areas in the zone to address traffic gridlock in that axis. This followed the adoption of a motion on notice moved by Rep. Akinola Moshood Kayode at plenary. He said the Dangote Group is constructing a refinery in the Lekki Free Zone in Lagos State which is projected to be a 650,000 barrels per day, integrated refinery and petrochemical facility, and is expected to be Africa’s biggest oil refinery as well as the world’s biggest single-train facility upon completion. He expressed concerns that considering the usual heavy traffic situation on the Lekki axis of Lagos State coupled with the influx of activities that the Dangote refinery will bring would result in serious traffic congestion, there was need for an alternative means of transportation to be provided to prevent unending gridlocks. The motion was voted and adopted as amended.
