The Ebonyi State House of Assembly on Tuesday declared the seats of three of lawmakers elected on the platform of the People Democratic Party (PDP), vacant. The three lawmakers are Ali Okechukwu (Ishielu North); Franca Okpo (Abakaliki North) and Victor Aleke (Ebonyi West). Recall that three seats had earlier been declared vacant by the house. This brings it to six. The development followed a joint letter of resignation purportedly written by the three lawmakers. The letters of their resignation were read by the speaker, Francis Nwifuru, on the floor of the House, after which he declared the seats of the three lawmakers vacant. He also ordered the clerk to write and notify the INEC of the development and the need to conduct fresh elections in the affected constituencies. The affected lawmakers were not present during the sitting. Recall that Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had last week sacked the 15 members of the House, who defected from PDP to APC The speaker also declared three months recess. But, Mr Aleke who spoke on behalf of others, described the actions of the speaker and the APC lawmakers as illegal. He said the speaker and the other APC lawmakers, having been sacked by the Federal High Court in Abuja, ceased to be lawmakers.
