A tragic incident occurred in Kano on Tuesday as a 19-month-old baby drowned in a well at Al-Ansar Quarters of Danbatta Local Government Area of the state. The incident which led to the death of the baby occurred when his mother was away from the vicinity. Confirming the incident to Daily Trust, the spokesman of the state’s Fire Service, Alhaji Saminu Abdullahi, said they received a distress call from one Salisu Bello and sent a rescue team to the scene. “The team removed the lifeless body of the child from the well while the Service began to investigate the incident,” he stated. Abdullahi added that the child’s corpse was handed over to his grandfather, Malam Abdulkadir for burial. He called on parents to be vigilant about their children’s movements to avoid such unpleasant circumstances, adding that children should not always be left alone no matter how little the moment is He however enjoined residents to endeavour to build high walls around their open wells and always provide a material that will cover them.
