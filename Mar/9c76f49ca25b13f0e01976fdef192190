FCT minister of State, Ramatu Aliyu, has decried the long years of discrimination against women, noting that its effect was the limitations of their ability to compete with their male counterparts in politics and business. Aliyu stated this on Tuesday at a programme organised by the FCT chapter of the Association of Women Town Planners to commemorate the international women’s day. She regretted that Nigerian women were undervalued and underestimated, adding that they were also faced with agricultural and business barriers. She challenged Nigerian women to strive hard towards breaking the barriers of inequality and discrimination. Represented by the Chairperson of the Women Constituency Group of the World Urban Campaign, Limota Goroso-Giwa, she expressed hope that Nigerian women would soon overcome cultural and religious barriers that widens gender inequality in the society. Speaking earlier, the Chairperson of the FCT chapter of the Association of Women Town Planners in Nigeria, Lami Ayuba, encouraged women to use the occasion of the international women day to strive towards making positive impact in nation building rather than complaining always. According to her, with determination Nigerian women can achieve much to entrench equality.
