Lanre Shittu Motors says it has taken many dropouts and area boys off the streets through its auto skill training and employment scheme for school leavers. The auto firm has also extended similar but advanced training skills to young graduates interested in pursuing a career in the automotive industry. In total, the frontline auto industry player stated that over 450 of such Nigerians have benefitted from the schemes. Executive Director of Lanre Shittu Motors Taiwo Shittu, who disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Lagos, said part of the empowerment scheme of the auto company is to help beneficiaries to secure decent jobs with good salaries. He said, “the company has contributed a lot to the Nigerian economy especially when it comes to manpower, training and empowerment of young Nigerians. “We have an empowerment scheme for school-leavers who have a passion for automotive development. They are trained for a period of four years and get paid even while on training. “After the training, we send them to our customers across the country to service them. We ask them to be employed, accommodated and paid well. In some cases, they are given a car and placed on a good salary that we dictate. “We are getting good testimonies from those we sent to Kano, Bauchi, Ondo and Cross River states, among others.”
