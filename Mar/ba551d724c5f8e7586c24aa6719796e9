 Former President Goodluck Jonathan has urged the people of Nembe LGA of Bayelsa State to see politics as a platform to bring development and not to kill and chase people away from their communities. Jonathan, who is also a former governor of the state, stated this yesterday during the commissioning of Nembe Unity Bridge linking Ogbolomabiri to Bassambiri, as part of activities marking Governor Douye Diri’s second term in office. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Douye Diri, Mr Daniel Alabrah, in a statement quoted Jonathan as praying that such brand of politics should come to an end in the area. The former president, who also commissioned Elebele Bridge in Ogbia LG, said the project would help to consolidate the peace and unity between the benefiting communities. He described the bridge as symbolic and urged the people of Nembe to learn to resolve their differences amicably, especially during elections rather than engage in politics of brigandage and violence. Governor Diri said the Nembe bridge had been on the drawing board since the days of Eastern Nigeria but that a former governor, who is now the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, started some construction work but the project was left till his administration took it over and completed it.
