A 30-year-old female member of a notorious armed robbery gang, Blessing Gabriel, has recounted how she went into robbery. Blessing, who the police described as the gang’s armourer, was arrested after her gang bugled some shops in Satellite Town, Lagos, during which goods worth millions of naira were stolen. “I was selling drugs, in small quantity, along Waterside area in Satellite town. I met members of my gang while selling drugs. “The gun found on me belongs to my gang. It was some members of my gang who were arrested earlier that led police to my hideout. “I hid the drug found on me inside my bra to prevent the police from seeing it. I regret going into crime,” she said. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Adekunle Ajisebutu, who paraded her, said she also belonged to a cult group. Ajisebutu said a miniature English pistol concealed in a bag and substance suspected to be hard drugs tucked under her bra were recovered.
