Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC – Imo) on Sunday said that if the possibility of a Tinubu and Rochas ticket emerged ahead of the 2023 presidential elections, he would clinch it. Okorocha, a former governor of Imo, said this while fielding questions from newsmen at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Convention in Abuja. “Uncle Tinubu and I are most likely to be. “I know that at the appropriate time it may be because he is the one pushing up in the southwest and I am in the southeast. “So let us see what happens between us, and if that is it, I will ask him to relax a bit so that we can move this section forward. “The people naturally love me and I think it is because they believe I care, they believe I love and have sympathy for humanity, they believe I am detribalised. “They believe I do not know religion or tribe, Muslim or Christian, Igbo or Hausa, Yoruba, all I see is a human being and that is what makes the difference on my side.’’ Okorocha urged Nigerians to use their voter’s cards well because it was worth much more than they thought. He said that 2023 would present an opportunity for them to make the right choices. “Whether it is for internal democracy or for general elections, you must ensure that you cast your vote right because the voter’s card contains everything.
