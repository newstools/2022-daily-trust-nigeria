The Ogun State Chapter of the Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC) and stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday endorsed the governorship candidature of the former spokesman of the Abubakar Atiku 2019 presidential campaign, Segun Sowunmi. Members of IPAC, led by the state chairman, Samson Ogunsanya, declared support for Sowunmi at a rally held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Ogunsanya, who was flanked by the National Publicity Secretary of Labour Party (LP), Abayomi Arabambi, and the Chairman of Mega Party (MP) Moshood Adesina, urged Sowunmi to run for the office of Ogun State governor. He insisted that if the PDP must make any appreciable impact in Ogun State, Sowunmi must be adopted as the governorship candidate of the party. Ogunsanya described Sowunmi as a selfless politician with the capacity to deliver Ogun State from the misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Sowunmi in his response, declared his ambition to contest the 2023 governorship election in the state.
