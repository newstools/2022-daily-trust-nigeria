The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) of Pensions Alliance Limited (PAL Pensions), Mr. Funso Doherty, has faulted Nigeria’s political system, which he described as a criminal process that must be changed for the country to move forward in the comity of nations. He however expressed relief with the passage of the new electoral act, saying if well implemented, it will bring about greater transparency in the electoral system. Doherty, who is a governorship aspirant in Lagos State under the African Democratic Congress (ADC), while speaking with newsmen, noted that the electronic transmission of results would reduce human errors in the conduct of elections. Of greater importance, he said, would be the need to change the psyche of the electorate and reduce money politics. He lamented that the voter apathy that plagued the last elections may be repeated in 2023 unless something was done by the political class to rejig the way politics is played in the country. According to him, the political class must ensure this as they have a critical role to play in shaping the minds of voters and demand for the best and high standards in the country. He also decried the quality of leadership in Nigeria, saying it ought to have a critical mass of people in leadership who should drive the right outcome.
