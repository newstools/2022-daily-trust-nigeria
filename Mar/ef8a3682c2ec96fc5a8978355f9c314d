Some stakeholders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) have opposed the choice of Senator Adamu Abdullahi by President Muhammadu Buhari as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). CPC is one of the legacy political parties that formed the APC in July 2013. Others are the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a splinter group of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and another splinter group of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The stakeholders under the Forum of Defunct CPC National Working and Executive Committees said the party leadership position must be ceded to someone from the CPC block, who is a founding member of the APC. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the national secretary of the forum, Okoi Obono-Obla, lamented that internal bickering and factionalisation had cost the party of electoral victories in the past because the party derailed from the dreams of its founding fathers due to leadership failure. The former chairman of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel on recovery of Public Property (SPIP) said former Nasarawa State governor, Senator Tanko Almakura, had the quality to save the party from electoral misfortunes. “We state that it is the turn of the tendency, which the defunct CPC represents to produce the next APC national chairman. “Senator Almakura is an embodiment of the finest values and leadership capabilities. He is an administrator par excellence, accomplished businessman, legislator, party manager, mediator, conciliator, and a progressive and patriotic Nigerian. “He is broadminded, a unifier, and imbued with excellent skills in managing inclusivity and diversity,” Obono-Obla said.
