Media Trust Limited (publishers of Daily Trust and other titles and owners of Trust tv) yesterday began a two-day workshop for journalists on crime reporting. The training tagged ‘Understanding Crime Reporting’ holding in Abuja, is supported by MacArthur Foundation. Declaring the workshop open, the acting Chief Executive Officer of Media Trust Ltd, Malam Nura Daura, said the engagement was to enrich reporters’ approach to crime reporting, urging them to take advantage of the opportunity. He charged journalists to embrace developmental journalism to maximally contribute to the development of the nation. Media Trust Ltd Executive Director/Editor-in-Chief, Naziru Mikailu, said the training was aimed at improving the medium’s City & Crime pages. He urged the reporters to do more by reporting more creatively and to humanize stories. “As soon as you leave here, we want to see what you have been taught in action. That will justify the essence of the workshop,” he added. Earlier in his opening remarks, the Programme Director, Daily Trust Foundation, Dr Theophilus Abbah, said the training was conceived to bring journalists up to speed, improve their abilities and optimise their productivity. At least 24 journalists, drawn from several media organisations and diverse platforms from major cities across the country are participating in the workshop.
