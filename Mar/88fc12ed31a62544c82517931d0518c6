Coronation Merchant Bank, a leading financial institution, is set to hold the March edition of its Interactive Session themed ‘Nigeria’s Economic Landscape – a blend of optimism and uncertainty. According to a statement, the virtual event will feature expert speakers such as Dr. Biodun Adedipe, Founder and Chief Consultant, Adedipe Associates; Dr. Andrew S. Nevin, Advisory Partner/Chief Economist at PwC Nigeria; Chinwe Egwim, Chief Economist at Coronation Merchant Bank and Prof. Joseph Nnanna, Chief Economist at the Development Bank of Nigeria. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Banjo Adegbohungbe, said the event was organized because “there are a number of factors, both positive and negative that are expected to influence the macroeconomic landscape in 2022. The lessons learnt on resilience as Nigeria embarked on a recovery path in 2021 will be critical in shaping the business and macroeconomic environment this year. This webinar will provide deep insights that will add value to strategic decision-making”. On his part Chinwe Egwim stated that since economies across the globe are still grappling with the economic effects from the coronavirus pandemic, the global economy would remain in recovery mode, but the rebound will be uneven across countries.
