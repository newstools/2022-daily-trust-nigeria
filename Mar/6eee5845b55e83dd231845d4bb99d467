A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State, Dr Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, has formally declared interest to contest for the governorship ticket of the party. This was contained in a statement issued Wednesday in Gombe by his media aide, Ibrahim Sani Shawai. According to the statement, Gwamna was on a rescue mission, to deliver the people of the state from the hardship they have been subjected to in the last three years by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He added that his ambition to contest for the gubernatorial seat was to harness the resources of the state for the benefit of the generality of the people. “I am here to serve and not to be served. I have empowered many youths and women with my personal resources, and I believe that I can do more with the resources of the state to improve the living standard of our people,” he said.
