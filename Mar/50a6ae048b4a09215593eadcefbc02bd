As the 2023 general elections draw closer, the Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’a Wa’ikamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS) has cautioned Muslims across the country to be wary of corrupt politicians who are always out to enrich themselves and their families. Sheik Sani Yahaya Jingir, who is the chairman, Ulama’u Council of JIBWIS, gave the warning Thursday during the opening of the 29th annual pre-Ramadan seminar, themed: “Good Governance and Best Approach to Public Security”, in Jos. Sheik Jingir called on Muslims to discard the attitude of vote buying during election periods, saying such attitude would not help in ensuring good governance in the country. He said, “Since it is through democracy that we will have good people in leadership, it is high time for us to be careful of those to represent us, and this is often achieved when you register and vote during the election. As Muslims then, we must get registered and also come out to vote at election time. “I urge all of us to unite, get registered and vote a better candidate that will lead us better. I pray Allah to give Nigeria a good leadership that will see to its development.” He, however, emphasised on his total rejection of rotation of power from one section of the country to another, saying such idea was against the tenets of true democracy, adding that people should use their votes to elect candidates of their choice devoid of zoning or rotational sentiments.
