She noted that “it’s aimed at increasing the patronage and consumption of products coming from Nigeria, not only by Muslims but also non-Muslims with selective lifestyles.” “Halal certification significantly enhances the marketability of products outside the country and the document is an important requirement on importing countries.” She said with Morocco and Malaysia benefiting from the halal economy, Nigeria has not been able to take advantage of the market to boost its foreign earnings, increase investment and adopt the concept to contribute to the growth and development of the economy. The permanent secretary of the ministry, Dr Evelyn Ngige, said there are challenges that have led to the non-certification of Nigerian products but added that government is ready to implement strategies to address the situation. She said the market would aid the government’s drive to diversify the economy into non-oil exports and generate necessary foreign exchange.
