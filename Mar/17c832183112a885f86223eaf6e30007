The Agricultural and Rural Development Secretariat (ARDS) of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), in collaboration with the Nigerian Metrological Agency (NIMET), has sensitised rural farmers across the area councils of the territory on the 2022 seasonal climate prediction. Speaking at the event on Wednesday in Gwagwalada Area Council, the director of ARDS, Mrs Francisca Ihekandu, said NIMET had the mandate to carry out seasonal climate predictions for the country on annual basis, noting that the secretariat had the responsibility of implementing policies and activities that would ensure overall development of agriculture in the FCT. She said weather forecast was key to optimum agricultural production and productivity in areas such as crop, forestry, livestock and fishery. According to her, the weather forecasts give information about the onset, duration and quantity of rain, dry spell, including the time of flooding. In his key note address, the secretary for agriculture and rural development, Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, said the issue of weather should be taken seriously; not just because of the role it played in the daily socio-economic activities, but in nurturing of the ecosystem.
