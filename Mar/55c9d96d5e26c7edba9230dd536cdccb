The Federal Government has said it will carry out an integrity test on the burnt Apongbon Bridge in Lagos before it can be reopened to traffic. The Lagos Controller, Works, Federal Ministry of Works, Engr. Olukayode Popoola, disclosed this in a chat with Daily Trust following the early morning fire that gutted the popular Apongbon market on Lagos Island. The fire was said to have damaged the part of Eko Bridge around the Apongbon market which links Lagos Island to Mainland. Emergency officials had put out the fire which destroyed many shops in the densely populated market while the dampening of the fire was going on at the time of filing this report. Speaking with our correspondent, Popoola said the bridge would remain “barricaded” pending when an integrity test would be carried out on the bridge to know whether itwould be permanently shut down for repair or not.
