A former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, has said the endorsement of a former governor of the state, Senator Abdullahi Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari as the next national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is mere speculation. In an interview with newsmen on Sunday in Abuja, Al-Makura said President Buhari believes in due process and rule of law and would not endorse an aspirant before an election in his party.

And what has really given me hope for this optimism is the uprightness of Mr President and his passion for due process. “So I believe that whatever comes from Mr President must come through a process. And I consider the process for the emergence of leadership. I believe it’s going to be transparent. I believe it’s going to be fair. And I believe it is going to conform to the articles and sections of the constitution dealing with that.” Answering a question on why he was still in the race after Buhari’s endorsement of Senator Adamu, Al-Makura said, “No, the sources of information were not authentic. They were not genuine. And I know what Mr President stands for. “He always stands for what is right and due process. And unless I have an authoritative source of information that is clear, I still have my doubts. I have many avenues through which I can reach Mr President and the people around him. “And since that speculation did not come through those avenues, I consider them as a speculation. That is why as I speak with you, my campaign is going with a different tempo, to ensure that my campaign is going far and wide to await the next line of action as directed by the party leadership.”
