Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has disclosed that the construction of the Badagry Deep Seaport will commence in June once the State is granted ratification by the Federal Government. The Governor made the disclosure during an engagement with stakeholders and representatives of host communities on the project. The Deep Seaport, which is to be sited in Gberefu area of Badagry in Lagos State was conceived about 10years ago during the administration of former Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola as a flagship project that when fully operational, will boost the fortunes of the people of Badagry, transform the entire economy of the State and that of the entire West African sub-region. During the meeting, which was held at the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON) Auditorium in Topo, Badagry, the governor said: “We need to go to Abuja to get a re-ratification because it is the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) that owns the license for Port. So, we need to get ratification from Abuja. That process has started, and we are praying that before the end of April, we will get that ratification.
