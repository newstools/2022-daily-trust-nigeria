Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Wednesday said no true progressives would leave the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the 2023 race gets closer. The governor’s remark is coming a day after some members of the party loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced their exit from the party. The financial secretary of the minister’s faction, Tajudeen Mohammed, confirmed to Daily Trust their decision to leave the party due to the protracted leadership crisis but was yet to decide which party to join. But speaking before a mammoth crowd at the inauguration of the Prince Sunday Fagbemi-led APC state executive committee in Ilorin, the state capital, the governor said no true progressives would leave the party under which Kwara is fast regaining its lost glory. According to him, “whatever disagreements among brothers can always be resolved if those involved are committed to the growth of the state.”
