Entrepreneurs, particularly startups, have been urged to acquire knowledge and the right competencies to succeed as the business environment is changing rapidly. The call was made at the second edition of the First City Monument Bank (FCMB) knowledge sharing and capacity building series, Top-5-In-5. CEO of Interswitch Limited, Mitchell Elegbe, in a presentation said entrepreneurs must have a unique business model and be clear on the products or services they are offering to the public. He stated that customers make purchases because they have a challenge with a solution fixed by the seller. “A clear idea of the problem you solve translates directly to the success of your business, particularly when it comes to monetising your solutions to hit the bottom line,” he said.
