Natives of Abuja have asked members of the National Assembly and the federal government not to blame them for any civil unrest in the FCT if the lawmakers failed to revisit the mayoral status as well as ministerial slot in the ongoing constitutional amendment. The natives are threatening to block all entries to the nation’s capital if their request is not immediately revisited by the lawmakers. The natives said they would no longer tolerate the marginalization meted on them by government, adding that they had decided to take their destiny in their hands by ensuring that they stage civil unrest to push for the actualization of their constitutional rights. Comrade Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf, Chief Advocate of Abuja Grassroots Advocacy Projects (AGAP), at a press briefing organised by some notable FCT stakeholders on Friday on behalf of the natives, said that the civil unrest would result in continuous blockage of all entries into the FCT, mostly the Airport road and ever-busy Kubwa-Zuba expressway. “From now, we have decided that we are not going to wait for another four years. We are going to take our destiny by force. By this, we are calling on members of the National Assembly to be very careful and revisit the mayoral status amendment. “It is not news that we have brought this bill before the National Assembly before and it failed to scale through, now we brought it again, the National Assembly members still deny the bill from scaling through. This is bad and inhuman. This time around, we cannot wait for another four years,” he said. “We are saying that the marginalization meted on our people can no longer be tolerated and the fact that we do not have identity is more worrisome and this must change,” he said
