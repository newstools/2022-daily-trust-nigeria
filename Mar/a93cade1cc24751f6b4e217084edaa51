The Director-General, National Institute for Transport Technology (NITT) Zaria, Dr. Bayero Salih-Farah, has urged the National Assembly to amend the law establishing the institution to expand its mandate for more revenue. He stated this while receiving members of the joint Senate and House Committee on land transport on a two-day oversight function to the Institution in Zaria. “The review of the Act would also expand the institute’s scope of operation and increase opportunities for revenue generation,’’ he noted. The Director-General explained that NITT has established Driver Development and Training Centres to stem the spate of road accidents. Salih-Farah said the centres were established across the country to train drivers on modern transport technologies, adding that the projects at the centres were progressing based on the 2021 budgetary provision.
