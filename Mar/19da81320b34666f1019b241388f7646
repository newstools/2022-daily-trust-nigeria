The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said it has completed the final stage of the construction of the new Kaduna to Jos 330 kilovolts (kV) double circuit transmission line. In a statement yesterday, the company said it also constructed eight multi-circuit towers at the intersection point of the new line to link an existing single circuit 330kv transmission line. TCN said the project is to maximize the lines’ corridor and facilitate the stringing of the triple circuit 330kv line conductors. With the completion of the lines and connected to the grid, they will increase the total capacity of bulk power transmission in the axis from 500 megawatts (MW) to 1,500MW. “Mando 330/132kV substation can now receive supply through two independent sources, that is either through Shiroro- Kaduna line 1 and 2 or through Jos – Kaduna 330kV line 1 and 2. “This will definitely provide system stability and reliability. This will boost power supply and socio- economic activities in Kaduna, Jos and neighboring areas,” said the statement.
