With over 600 million people living without access to modern energy, Africa’s energy demand has been projected to rise by 40 per cent in 2035, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has disclosed. He said the growth will be driven largely by industrialization, population and expansion in economic activities, adding that the federal government and governments of other African countries require huge funding to meet the rising demand for energy. Sylva spoke yesterday at the African Local Content Investment Forum (ALCIF) for African Oil Producing Countries hosted by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in Lagos. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Dr. Nasir Gwarzo, the minister observed that the local content programme for Africa can only be impactful to various economies “If there is a pipeline of projects that will sustain the utilization of capacities and capabilities developed or being developed in the industry.” The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Engr. Simbi Wabote, noted that the African electricity requirement was estimated to be about two terawatts out of which a paltry 162 gigawatts or less than 10% is generated. However, he stated that the challenge of inadequate energy is partly the reason why Africa is faced with poverty, conflicts, migration, brain drain and ranks very low on the human development Index.
