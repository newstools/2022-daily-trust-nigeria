 A former Governor of Ekiti State, Engr. Segun Oni, has formally launched himself into the state on the platform of the Social Democratic Party(SDP), urging Ekiti voters to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and sweep out the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) in the state. Oni said the SDP he brought represented progress, which he accused APC and the dominant opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for failing to provide for the people. The former governor was welcomed to Ado Ekiti via Ikere road by a large crowd of party admirers adorned in SDP vests carrying Oni’s portrait and a big horse, the logo of the party. Oni was accompanied by his running mate, an Ado Ekiti indigene, Hon. Ladi Owolabi, with many admirers causing traffic gridlock along Ado-Ikere-Akure road for over two hours. Addressing the crowd, Oni described the ruling APC under Governor Kayode Fayemi as a colossal failure, saying the SDP he brought to Ekiti represents progress.
