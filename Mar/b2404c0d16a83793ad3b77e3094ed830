A Sharia court in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, on Monday, granted the prayer for divorce filed by a housewife, Rakiya Ladan, on the grounds that she no longer loved her husband, Yahaya Abba. The judge, Nuhu Falalu, terminated the nine-year-old marriage and ordered Abba to allow his estranged wife to take all her belongings from his house.

The union has yielded children and the defendant cannot return his wife to her original form before he married her.” Earlier, Rakiya, through her counsel, Abdulrauf Atiku, told the court that she was seeking divorce because she no longer loved her husband and could not continue with the marriage. She said she was ready to pay back the N20,000 which he paid as her bride price and therefore prayed the court to order her husband to allow her to take her belongings from his house. Responding, Abba before accepting to allow his estranged wife to take anything from his house, said he bought all the belongings with his money. (NAN)
