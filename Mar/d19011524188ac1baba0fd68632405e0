Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has said the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has no opposition in Kano. Ganduje stated this while inaugurating the party’s 432 local government and 4,644 ward executive members from Kano South Senatorial District, which comprises 16 local governments. The inauguration came after the Court of Appeal in Abuja upheld the appeal by the Ganduje-led faction of APC in Kano against the party’s faction loyal to a former governor of the state, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau. The appeals followed the two rulings of an FCT High Court which upheld the ward and local government congresses won by the faction loyal to Shekarau and Senator Jibril Barau (Kano North), numbering about 17,908 and 1,319 members respectively. Ganduje congratulated the new executive members for emerging victorious in their respective elections and in court. He stressed that, “APC in Kano has no opposition now. You have to work very hard for the progress of the party.” Governor Ganduje distributed 16 vehicles to the party leaders across the 16 local governments and the senatorial zone chairman.
