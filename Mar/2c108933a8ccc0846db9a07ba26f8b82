The Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said he is open to the harmonious resolution of the crisis rocking the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The PDP in the state has been engulfed in crisis since the governor joined and clinched its ticket at the build-up to the governorship election. Obaseki said this Thursday in a statement in Benin in reaction to the setting up of a three-man reconciliation committee by the national leadership of the PDP to resolve the crisis rocking the state chapter. “There has been a flurry of statements and comments on social media by mischief makers who are hiding under the pretext of the ongoing conversation between leaders within the PDP to stir crisis and cause disaffection. “These statements and irresponsible behaviour are outrightly condemned. We hereby distance ourselves from the actions of these detractors,” he said.
