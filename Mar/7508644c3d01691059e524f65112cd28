The organised labour movement, on Thursday, revealed that it will form an alliance with the Cuban government and a former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Attahiru Jega, to rescue the country from “bad governance”. Other people, the Nigerian workers, under the aegis of Trade Union Congress (TUC) are teaming up with, include human rights activist Omoyele Sowore; former governor of Ondo State, Olusegun Mimiko; Zenith Labour Party and other small political parties. This is as the Labour Party charged all workers in both formal and informal sectors to stop being card-carrying members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying the two parties had destroyed the country. President of TUC, Quadri Olaleye, who said this in Abuja while speaking at a conference organised by the congress titled ‘Political Roundtable on Sustainable Democracy in Nigeria’, said Nigerian workers have resolved to stop being onlookers while politicians continued to destroy the country’s economy. Speaking at the conference, the National Chairman of Labour Party, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, argued that it had been the Nigerian workers giving life-support to many politicians in both the APC and the PDP which have been raping them and the country.
