The chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in Kaduna State, Alhaji Ahmadu Yaro Coca-Cola, has appealed to aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to dump the party. According to him, as one of the founders of CPC, he knew the difficulties they went through alongside Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and members of the new PDP to form APC in 2013. Addressing newsmen on the current leadership crisis in the ruling APC, he said they will remain in the party with President Muhammadu Buhari who was their presidential flag bearer in the 2011 elections. He cautioned CPC members to be careful with the new political parties coming up ahead of the 2023 general elections, saying as politicians, they are aware of the challenges in the ruling party but they are not going to defect to any party but remain till the ruling party resolves its crisis.
