Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has urged Ministries Department and Agencies (MDAs) of the federal government to ensure the successful implementation of reforms of the 7th National Action Plan (NAP 7.0) of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). Osinbajo gave the advice on Wednesday in Abuja, when he received the progress report of the council after the ongoing NAP 7.0 reached mid-way point (30 days) in its 60-day cycle. He noted that in line with the commitment to improving the business environment in Nigeria, the council had commenced NAP 7.0 on February 7 to drive the implementation of these key reforms. Daily Trust reports that the NAP was introduced for the first time in February 2017 and has since become a signature for a homegrown 60-day accelerator and reform tool. The Vice President thanked the PEBEC team led by the Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business and Council Secretary, Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, for their efforts and commitment towards ensuring the implementation of the reforms. “The mid-term report is very detailed to the specific issues that need to be addressed, there is the need for urgency in addressing the issues, and also the need for escalations,” he said. In her presentation to the council, Oduwole, said that there are 58 reforms for implementation under NAP 7.0 which will run from 7th February to 7th April. She said as at March 8, day 30 of the Plan, the reforms implemented stood at 26 percent. The indicators for NAP 7.0 are focused on five broad areas for reforms, namely: agro-export, airport, automation, regulatory and Executive Order 1 (EO1)/ReportGov.NG reforms.
