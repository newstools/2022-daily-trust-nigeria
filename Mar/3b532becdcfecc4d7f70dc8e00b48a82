The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, disclosed this yesterday while briefing State House reporters on the outcome of the federal cabinet meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja. He said the council approved N1.5 billion to develop an initial five-megawatt power plant and electrical reticulation within one of its special economic zones in Lekki under the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) because of the plan for textile and garment. He said the contract to be delivered within a period of 52 weeks was awarded to Messrs. Mustra Energy Limited. The minister added that FEC also approved N1.9 billion for the construction of an access road with associated drainage works from the Lekki-Epe Expressway, through the textile and garment park, in favour of Messrs.
