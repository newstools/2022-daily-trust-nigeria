The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), has called on the federal government to sign the National Transport Commission Bill into law to drive private investments in the road transportation sector. The call was made at the Road Corridor Development Initiative in Nigeria organised by the Transport Trade Group (TTG) of the ACCI in partnership with the National Chamber Policy Centre (NCPC). In a statement by ACCI’s Media/Strategy Officer, Olayemi John-Mensah, its Vice President on Communication Strategy and External Relation, Dr Aliyu Idi Hong, said the bill, was to provide a regulatory body and law for the entire transport sector adding that the Road Corridor Development Initiative is an important area of focus that must be given attention by stakeholders across various government and business community. He said the development is an integral and strategic nerve of the Nigerian economy, which cannot be overemphasised but over the years, it has been neglected witnessing slow progress that has frustrated the movement of goods and services and the ease of doing business. On his part, the Chairman of the roundtable, Mallam Bukhari Bello noted that the proposed commission will create a regulatory structure, which will, in turn, enhance investors’ confidence to boost investment in the sector. While stating that the huge resources needed to develop the road sector cannot be provided alone by the government without the private sector, Bello states that the lack of a regulatory framework is an impediment to private sector investment.
