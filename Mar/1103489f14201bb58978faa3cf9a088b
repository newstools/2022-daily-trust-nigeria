Ahead of the 2023 general elections, Yiaga Africa has said it has established People’s Assembly in Lagos and Sokoto states to promote public deliberation in LGAs and grassroots. The Director of Programmes, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, who said this on Monday in Abuja in a statement, said the scheme was an initiative of Yiaga Africa under its Turn-Up Democracy project. She said the Turn-Up Democracy is supported by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom. “The People’s Assembly is a form of deliberative democracy tool that promotes the culture of public deliberation amongst the people. It promotes equal participation of diverse groups through debates and consensus-building on issues affecting respective communities to inform governmental actions and policies in selected local governments.
