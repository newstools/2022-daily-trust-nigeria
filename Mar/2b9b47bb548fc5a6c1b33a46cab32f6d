Kinsmen and followers on Wednesday endorsed former governor Otunba Gbenga Daniel’s bid for the Ogun East senatorial seat in next year’s election. Members of the group under the aegis of the Gateway Front Foundation (GFF), spoke on Wednesday when he visited his ancestral homestead at Oje Compound in Isote, Makun, Sagamu, Ogun State. The event featured the disbursement of scholarship awards to indigent students from Sagamu LGA in different tertiary institutions in the country. Many of them spoke glowingly about Daniel, recalling his achievements in the state during his eight-year tenure, and prayed for the actualisation of his senatorial bid in 2023. On his part, the former governor thanked his kinsmen for their invaluable support over the years and promised not to betray the trust and confidence reposed in him.
