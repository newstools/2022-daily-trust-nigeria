The newly elected national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has assumed duty at the party’s national secretariat. Senator Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, arrived the Buhari House by 11am alongside other members of the National Working Committee (NWC). A crowd of supporters cheered them on as they settled for business of the day. He emerged the party’s helmsman last Saturday at the convention of the APC held in Abuja. This is his first appearance at the party’s headquarters since his election.
