The Former Governors Forum of the Peoples Democratic Party has warned that the country is heading towards disaster following prevailing situations in the country. A communiqué issued after a meeting of the forum in Abuja noted that over 80 per cent of Nigerians have agreed that the country was going through the wrong path and was heading toward disaster. The communiqué, signed by Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu, chairman of the forum stated that the “sprawling increase in job loss, insecurity, poverty, bad economy, and loss of sense of belonging amongst citizens, the worsening state of petroleum scarcity and bad management of the country’s resources by the ruling APC are signs that all is not well. The former governor said most Nigerians across all levels and social strata were tired of the lies and deceits by the present government and were eagerly looking forward to a better change.
