The New Nigeria Peoples’ Party (NNPP) on Thursday launched its presence in Benue State with a determination by its leaders to take over the state in the coming 2023 elections. Speaking at the event in Makurdi, Prof. Bem Angwe, who is the National Legal Adviser of the party, said the NNPP had brought the message of hope for a new Nigeria and new Benue. “We will change the narrative of politics in Benue. Our party represents the voice of the voiceless, the pained, those in hunger, the rejected. It is a divine party formed 21 years ago. It has remained hidden,” he said. The State Caretaker Chairman, Group Capt. Steve Adah (rtd), said the launch and inauguration of the party’s caretaker committee in the state would begin the process of rescuing Nigerians and Benue. In Jigawa, the party said it has commenced massive membership recruitment as the countdown to the 2023 general elections begins. The state chairman of the party, Gambo Ibrahim Alawo, said NNPP has a brighter prospect of winning the 2023 elections in the country since the two major political parties have failed the nation. Fielding questions from newsmen after the party’s state caucus at its headquarters in Dutse on Thursday, Alawo said NNPP was ready to receive new members into its fold.
