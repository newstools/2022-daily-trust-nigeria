Amidst the leadership crisis rocking the Kano Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA), the state government has approved the immediate dissolution of the leadership of the chamber. Daily Trust reports that the tenure of the leadership of Alhaji Dalhatu Abubakar as its president elapsed in October, 2021 and since then the chamber has been engulfed in one crisis after the other. A statement issued by the Public Relations Officer, Cabinet Office, Musa Tanko Muhammad and signed by the Secretary to the Kano State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji said it has become necessary to take the action owing to the inability of the current leadership of the body to organize a fresh and acceptable election even long after the expiration of their tenure. The statement added that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has already approved the setting up of a nine-member caretaker committee, led by a renowned industrialist, Alhaji Lawan Sale Garo to hold election within six months. The committee chairman, Alhaji Lawan Sule Garo expressed appreciation for the confidence reposed in them and assured that the committee will work assiduously to achieve the set goals within the stipulated period. Speaking to Daily Trust, the immediate past President of KACCIMA, Alhaji Abubakar Dalhatu whose tenure elapsed in October 2021 said the issue was that some members could not organise themselves, hence, they tried to see that they have it under control. “They took the matter to the court that they are against a faction and all of that. But since the government is involved, a caretaker committee has been set up and the election will be held.”
