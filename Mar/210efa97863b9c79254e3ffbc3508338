A former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, has rued ‘neglect’ of the local government administrations in Nigeria, saying until the third tier of government is activated, the dividends of democracy cannot spread. He spoke in Abeokuta, the state capital, during the South West Conference of the Association of Ex-Local Government Chairmen of Nigeria (ASELGON). Daniel, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), noted that the LGs are comatose, putting pressure on state governors who, according to him, are “sweating and trying to satisfy the people.” According to him, until we return to the days of old when local governments are empowered financially and otherwise, we would not be able to spread the dividends of democracy. “Part of the tragedy we have in recent times in our country is that we are not taking local government administration as seriously as we should take it. Every now and then I see quite a number of our brothers who are governors sweating, trying to do their best to make sure they satisfy the people. “But the fact of the matter is that however they try, they cannot; they do not have the time and the capacity to reach the local government. “So, until we return to the days of old when local governments are empowered financially and otherwise, we would not be able to spread the dividends of democracy,” he said. In his remarks, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, said his administration has been able “to tackle insecurity headlong, due to the promotion of synergy among security agencies in the state and other security collaborations with Oyo and Lagos states.” The national president of ASELGON, Albert Asipa, demanded the inclusion of former elected chairmen as automatic delegates to the national conventions of their respective parties.
