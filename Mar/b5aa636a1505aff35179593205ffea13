Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has taken a swipe at his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, calling him a politician fond of the serial betrayal of those who helped to advance his political aspiration. Wike made the accusation at the inauguration of the Community Secondary School, Omuanwa in Ikwerre LGA of the state on Monday. Governor Obasaki had earlier upbraided Governor Nyesom Wike over his recent outburst on his deputy, Philip Shaibu, saying that the PDP structure did not belong to the latter. The Rivers State governor maintained that he owed the former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, an apology for opposing him when he insisted that Obaseki was a treacherous and ungrateful man. “If you go and check the DNA of Godwin Obaseki, what you’ll see in that DNA serial betrayal and ungratefulness. “Let me stand today to apologise to Adams Oshiomhole, who has been vindicated by telling us that we will see the true colour; we’ll see the insincerity, and we’ll see the ungratefulness of Godwin Obaseki,” he said.
