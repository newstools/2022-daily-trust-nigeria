The management of the University of Calabar (Unical) has directed all students to vacate their halls of residence with immediate effect. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the directive, issued on Tuesday, by the institution’s registrar, Mr Gabriel Egbe, was sequel to the strike embarked upon by the non-teaching staff of Nigerian universities. According to the statement, the strike will adversely affect the provision of basic services in the halls of residence and the campus generally. “Consequently, the acting chief security officer of the institution has been advised to lock up all the hostels, as well as deploy security men to man all the halls of residence. “Management wishes all students journey mercies as they travel to meet their parents/guardians,” the management’s statement read in part.
