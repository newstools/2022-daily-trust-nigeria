Qatar Airways inaugural flight Wednesday landed at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano, amid excitement from aviation stakeholders. The aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, landed at the airport by 11:10 a.m and was welcomed with a ceremonial water shower by officials of the Aerodrome and Fire Rescue Service of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). This would be followed by Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on Friday. The inaugural flight was brought in by Qatari Captain Mohammed Abdulla and a Nigerian First Officer from Oyo State, Adeola Olamide Ogunmola. The state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner serving the route offers 22 seats in Business Class and 232 in economy. Qatar Airways’ vice president, Africa, Hendrik du Preez, said: “The new route will connect Kano, via Doha, to more than 140 destinations across its network. “Kano has been a trade and travel hub for hundreds of years. Now, by linking it to the world’s best airport, Hamid International Airport in Doha, we hope to grow traffic between these two important hubs.” Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, represented by the Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Musa said the flight is a watershed in the history of Kano State where aviation started in 1922. The Emir of Kano, HRH Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, also lauded the flight, saying it is a thing of joy and delight for the people of Kano.
