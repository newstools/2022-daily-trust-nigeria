The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chapter, has called off the indefinite strike it started on Feb. 17. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NULGE began the industrial action over non-payment of Jan. 2022 salary, and non-release of Dec. 2021 allocation to local councils by the FCT Administration. The FCT NULGE President, Ibrahim Kabi, in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, called on all members of the union in the six area councils to resume work immediately. “The union embarked on the industrial action on Feb. 17, for non-payment of January salaries and release of councils’ allocation. “The FCTA has today released the councils’ allocation where members have started seeing their salary alerts which has been our major agitation. “Sequel to the above, the protest has been cancelled and all members are hereby directed to resume in their places of work,” he said.
