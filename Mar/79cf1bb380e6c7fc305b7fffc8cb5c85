The Range Rover Discovery line-up has gained new traction with the addition of several features in the 2023 coming with a 355-hp inline-six engine, special 22-inch wheels, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, and heated seats for all three rows. According to information provided by the company, the exterior is dressed up with unique grille, special emblems, and silver bumper inserts; inside, a new Titanium Mesh trim is inlaid on the dash and door panels. In terms of engine transmission and performance, no significant change was made. Our correspondent reports that all Discovery models come with full-time all-wheel drive as standard, but buyers can choose between a 296-hp turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder or a 355-hp turbocharged 3.0-litre inline-six, the latter of which employs a 48-volt hybrid system. All Discovery models come standard with Land Rover’s Pivi Pro infotainment system. It features an 11.4-inch touchscreen display and advanced features such as an onboard Wi-Fi hotspot powered by a 4G LTE data connection and real-time traffic-and-weather updates. Pivi Pro debuted with the Land Rover Defender in 2020 and is being rolled out in other Land Rover and Jaguar products. It features a simpler menu layout and is capable of over-the-air updates. As many as nine USB ports dot the cabin, and novel tablet-holding accessories can be used to set up rear-seat entertainment for kids. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability is standard, as is a wireless smartphone charging pad, a 12.3-inch digital gauge display, and a full-colour head-up display. A handful of driver-assistance features are standard here, but more advanced tech will require upgrading to an optional package. Land Rover also offers a novel 360-degree exterior camera system that also provides a view of what is directly under the front end of the Discovery—the area blocked from view by the hood—which is intended to improve safety when driving off-road.
