An Ekiti State customary court sitting in Ado-Ekiti has dissolved a 30-year-old marriage between Oyindamola Sesan and his wife, Mojisola. Sesan, a 51-year-old driver, had petitioned the court for dissolution of the union with his wife, alleging stealing, adultery, regular fighting, refusal to take correction, adding that the wife no longer took care of their children. The union had produced five children. In his evidence, the petitioner said the respondent stole and committed adultery, adding that she moved out of his house over a year ago. Sesan asked the court to separate them and award him the custody of their children because he had been taking care of them. The president of the court, Mrs. F. O. Oyeleye, noted that both the petitioner and the respondent were free to do as they pleased because the court could not separate what is not in existence. “Since all the requirement of a valid marriage is absent in the relationship, there is no marriage between the parties, they are free to go their separate ways,” she ruled. The court awarded the custody of all the children to the petitioner but said the respondent was free to check on the children but must call the petitioner before visiting his house.
