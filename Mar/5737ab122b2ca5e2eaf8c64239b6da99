Corruption is inhibiting quality service delivery in the maritime sector, the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Nigeria’s maritime economic regulator has said. Mr Emmanual Jime, Executive Secretary, NSC, stated this when the Head of the Technical Unit on Governance & Anti- Corruption Reforms (TUGAR), Joan Onwulere,  led her team to pay a courtesy call on him in Abuja. He said the NSC too will deliver more quality services when corruption is tackled. Jime pledged the continued support of the NSC to the team to measure sanity of the maritime industry. “Let us also be aware that there is still several ways to go,  there is a lot of work left to be done. “What we do at the NSC,  because of the important role we play of regulating the commercial sector of the maritime domain,  there is no way we will deliver on quality services if those services are mitigated by the incidences of corruption” he said.. “We are together in this and it is a battle that I believe is winable, but we have to carry on with this work to its logical ends” he said. On implementation of Nigeria Port Process Manual (NPPM), the executive secretary said one of its challenges was that the NSC was the only agency bearing its burden. “I regret to say that the greatest challenge perhaps you may face going forward is that the shippers council appears to have been bearing the burden of the implementation of the port process manual single handily” he noted. “This is supposed to be inter-agency platform,  and so we can use this platform to appeal to all of the other agencies of government that are partners to what we do to also join shippers council in assisting.
