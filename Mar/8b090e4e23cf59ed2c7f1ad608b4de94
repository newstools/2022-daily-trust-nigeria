One of Nigeria’s major airlines, Dana Air, Thursday explained that recent disruptions to its flights were a result of ramp congestion, bad weather and scarcity of aviation fuel known as Jet A1. Daily Trust had reported on Wednesday that aviation fuel scarcity has been causing massive delays and cancellations of flights in recent times. Deputy CEO of Dana Air Sukhjinder Mann, while providing insight into the challenges being faced by the operator, said it has been “heartbreaking” for him and the entire Dana Air family to know that passengers “have been inconvenienced and disappointed” by their services. He explained that Dana Air’s commitment has always been centred on offering reliable air transport, setting new standards in customer experience and redefining air travel in Nigeria. “However, I admit that we have been falling short on this commitment in the last few days and not living up to our promise to offer a reliable schedule and on-time performance that we have come to be known for.
