A factional chairman of the Taraba State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Barr. Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi, has accused some party stakeholders of using the judiciary to destabilise the party in the state. El-Sudi, who spoke to newsmen yesterday in Abuja, specifically accused a former deputy governor, Alhaji Sani Abubakar Danladi, of influencing a Federal High Court judge to give injunctions in favour of his (Danladi) camp.

He called on the national leadership of the APC to wade into the crisis and save the Taraba chapter from implosion ahead of the 2023 elections which the party under his leadership is poised to win overwhelmingly. Efforts to get Senator Danladi to react to the allegation were fruitless. He did not pick up calls to his mobile phone number nor replied to a WhatsApp message.
