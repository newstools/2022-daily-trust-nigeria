The Tinubu Support Group (TSG) has commenced rallies across the 20 local government areas of Lagos State to garner support for the aspiration of the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Thousands of APC leaders, supporters and loyalists of Asiwaju, as well as market men and women and artisans converged on Kosofe Federal Constituency of the state to launch TSG.
