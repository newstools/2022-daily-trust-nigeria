A Benin-based Optometrist, Dr Felix Adeyemi, has advised adults to regularly go for eye screening to avoid glaucoma, a condition that damages eye’s optic nerve and gets worse over time. Adeyemi gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Benin. He said that as the optice nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in the visual field. He added that glaucoma could occur at any age, but common in older adults, saying that many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. He said “elevated eye pressure is due to buildup of fluid (aqueous humor) that flows inside the eye. (NAN)
