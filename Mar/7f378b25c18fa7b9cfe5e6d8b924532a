 A foremost accountant and Managing Director/ CEO of Pensions Alliance Limited, Mr. Funso Doherty, has joined the African Democratic Congress (ADC) while declaring his intention to contest for the office of governor of his ‘home state’, Lagos. Doherty stated that he was joining the race to ensure proper utilisation of the resources of the state. At a public declaration event held in Lagos Island, Doherty said Lagos deserves the best for the management of its abundant resources. He promised to prioritise the welfare of workers, adding that people should be paid decent wages, as without that, the moral authority to insist on integrity will be undermined and there will be no lasting solution.
