Women entrepreneurs have been urged to take advantage of livestock farming especially geese and rabbit farming to improve their means of livelihood. The appeal was given by the Reality Investment Consultancy Services (RICS) during the Reality International Women’s Day in Kaduna over the weekend. Speaking at the event, an Associate Partner with RICS, Ahmed Garba said out of the seven categories registered across the country, geese and rabbit farming received the least response as there were not many female entrepreneurs engaged in such farming. He then called on women to take advantage of various businesses to improve their lives and that of their families. According to him, “This year’s Reality International Women’s Day offers a variety of privileges to women such as acquiring modern tools for business improvement, learning techniques in achieving desired goals and gaining the requisite knowledge on how to effectively manage and sustain their business to desired levels. “The programme is designed to ensure that thousands of female local entrepreneurs as well as the start-up groups get involved and explore the opportunities and benefits which they can use to enhance their businesses.” An Associate Professor with the Kaduna State University, Professor Maryam Abdu said “There are no businesses anymore but entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs are now responsible for income generation and income development, which is why they need to be stronger.” On her part, the Chairman, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Kaduna State Branch, Pharmacist Talatu Ebune urged the Northern governors to consider the possibility of going into drug production in the northern region.
