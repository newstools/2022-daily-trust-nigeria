Commuters along the Apo-Karshi road axis will soon breathe a sigh of relief as the contractors have assured the FCT Administration of the timely completion of the project. The revelation was made when the Coordinator, FCT Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD), Comrade Obinna Francis Ogwuegbu, paid an unscheduled visit to the Apo-Karshi road project site which was awarded in parts to Messrs SCC Nigeria and Kakatar CE Ltd., where he received assurance that the road would be ready for commissioning soon. Accompanied to the site by his team of engineers led by the Director, Regional Infrastructure, Bldr. Amaechi Obiekwe, the coordinator expressed pleasure at the pace of the work and urged the contractors to ensure completion and eventual commissioning on schedule. A statement from the STDD spokesperson, Meeme Felicia, said the coordinator also reminded the contractors of the huge relief the road would bring to FCT residents when completed. The Managing Director, M/s Kakatar CE, Engr Azibaola Roberts, commended the coordinator for his commitment towards the project, and also appreciated both the FCT minister and minister of state for adequate and timely releases of funds.
