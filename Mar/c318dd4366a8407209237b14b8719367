Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has described aspirants and other members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who are against zoning as selfish. Speaking at a meeting with PDP senators and members of the House of Representatives in Abuja, Wike said the founding fathers of the party were not wrong in introducing the zoning policy and asked members of the party to stick to it. Wike said, “Our founding fathers never made a mistake; they know the complexity of this country. It is not because they don’t want merit, no, but they said for Nigeria to move forward, this is the way we are going to do it for fairness, equity and justice. “The constitution provides that there shall be rotation of parties, offices and elective positions for fairness, equity and justice. Some people argued let us win first before we share. But when we zoned in 2017, what did we have, were we in power? “People should speak the truth; it doesn’t stop you from running election. You want because I want to run for president, to go and tell lies to people, we don’t do that; that is not fair.” Also, yesterday, Wike, insisted that he remained the best presidential candidate that can defeat the APC in next year’s election. He spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, when he and former governor Fayose of Ekiti State met with Hon. Ladi Adebutu. Wike and Fayose joined Adebutu at the Ake Palace Ground in Abeokuta, where the former lawmaker officially declared his ambition to contest for the governorship seat on the platform of the PDP.
