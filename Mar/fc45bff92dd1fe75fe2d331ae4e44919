Nhlanhla Lux Dlamini, the leader of an anti-migrant protest movement in South Africa, has been arrested. Police said Lux Dlamini was arrested on Thursday. There is an increase in the spate of attacks on foreigners in South Africa, including Nigerians. Hundreds of Nigerians have left the country out of fear of being attack. The 30-year-old Nhlanhla Lux Dlamini was taken to Johannesburg’s central police station for questioning. Dlamini, a black activist, is known in his community for moving around in a luxury sports car. He is also known for his public appearances, almost always wearing military fatigues and a bulletproof vest. The arrest drew criticism from members of his movement, who used social networks to threaten to intensify their activities.
