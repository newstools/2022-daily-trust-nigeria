The Green Alliance, a political movement, has urged the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to respond to calls on him to contest the 2023 presidential election. The group said Emefiele’s emergence would ensure the sustainability of President Muhammadu Buhari’s economic policies and programmes, especially on agriculture. Addressing a press conference in Abuja at the weekend, the Convener of Green Alliance, Valentine Gabriel, said the feat recorded by President Buhari in the area of infrastructure and agriculture would not have been possible without the friendly monetary policy of the CBN led by Emefiele. He said, “If you look at Emefiele’s activities as CBN governor, you will see that there is nobody in this government that has supported the programmes of Baba Buhari more than Godwin Emefiele, nobody. “When the president came, he said one of the things we need to do as a nation is to diversify our economy and to invest in agriculture. “Immediately, Emefiele keyed into this and we are seeing various remarkable interventions in this sector of the Nigerian economy. “We are asking him to run because we don’t want anybody to come and rubbish all that this present government has achieved; we need consolidation.”
