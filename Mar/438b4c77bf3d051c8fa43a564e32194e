Speaking during the 5-day training workshop held in Maiduguri, the Director General of NDE, Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo, said the objective of the training was to counsel participants to choose the type of business that fits their interest. Represented by the State Coordinator of NDE, Mairo Betara Aliyu, the D-G explained that the exercise will facilitate opportunities for the participants to interface with resource persons to mentor them on the production of feasible business plans with the capability of being funded by financial institutions. The state coordinator, on his part, also said the training will also link the participants with relevant stakeholders having the wherewithal to assist them in funding their viable projects. On behalf of the trainees, Abubakar Mohammed Askira said: “We have learnt new skills and ideas but the only thing now is to get the grant to execute the knowledge we acquired because the major challenge facing small businesses in Maiduguri is business risk.”
