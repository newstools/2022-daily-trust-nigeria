Ukraine officials say Russian strikes on Sunday hit an art school in the Ukrainian city, Mariupol, where about 400 people were taking shelter. Last week a theatre sheltering more than 1000 was demolished by Russian forces. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 humanitarian crisis has kept on deteriorating. The officials added that the building has been destroyed and people might have been trapped under the rubble, BBC reports. They also alleged that thousands of residents have been forcibly taken to Russian cities, even though the claim could not be verified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, further alleged that Russia committed war crimes in the city, where heavy fighting has now reached the centre. Meanwhile, the UK defence ministry has said that Russia had failed to gain control of the air and is relying on weapons launched from its own airspace. But Ukraine’s military said Russia paused offensive operations on Saturday, instead of replenishing supplies and repairing equipment.
