Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the fact that the convention of the ruling party is ongoing shows evildoers did not have their way. In a chat with NTA at Eagle Square, venue of the convention, the former Edo governor expressed satisfaction with developments at the convention. He said, “I am happy, I am excited that the party will be restored to the leadership position that it ought to be. We are democrats and our party is for the ordinary Nigerians. It is not a party of big men. “For us to have our convention today shows that evildoers can have their plans but God has produced someone today. And we have more people of goodwill than the evil ones who wanted this convention to happen today.” Oshiomhole’s removal paved way for the Convention/Caretaker Extraordinary Planning Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State. Buni was supposed to conduct the convention after six months, but the exercise is now holding two years after Oshiomhole’s removal.
