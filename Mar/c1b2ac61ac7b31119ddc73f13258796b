A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has said there is nothing wrong in cross carpeting from one political party to another. The two-term governor said it is even wiser when a politician changed to another party to test his popularity and acceptance by  the people. Kwankwaso spoke in Kano during a meeting with members of the Kwankwasiyya movement and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus of the state at his Miller Road residence. “Staying or leaving a particular party is not bad in the game of politics. In fact, that is to show that you know politics very well and can cope with all its challenges,” he said. Kwankwaso added that although he is still in PDP, he would soon decamp to the New Nigeria Progressive Party (NNPP). “Although APC is the most disappointing party presently in Nigeria, but they are almost in the same shoe with the PDP, as it is the party where your right and freedom can be taken for granted. No matter how qualitative you are, there are some unprofessional there to bring you down and deprive you of your right,” he said. Daily Trust had last week reported that uncertainty and confusion have trailed the revelation by Kwankwaso of his plan to dump the PDP at the end of the month with some of his followers, however, saying they will not follow him.
