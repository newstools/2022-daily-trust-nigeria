The police in Kwara State have arraigned two brothers, Abdullateef and Yusuf, before an Ilorin magistrates’ court for exhuming their father’s corpse for ritual. The brothers were dragged to court on two count charges of criminal conspiracy and exhuming corpse from a grave. The prosecutor, Moshood Adebayo, told the court that the siblings led some people to their family compound and removed the remains of their late father, Zakarya Adekanye, from the Agba Akin Court, Offa, where he was buried in 2012 according to Islamic rites. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. The magistrate, Mohammed Adams, ordered the defendants to be remanded at the Oke-Kura correctional centre and adjourned the case to April 12.
