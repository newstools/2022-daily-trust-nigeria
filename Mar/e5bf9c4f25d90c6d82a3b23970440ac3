A businesswoman, Mrs Vera Okoroma, on Thursday, at a customary court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, wept in court as the judge, Labaran Gusau, adjourned her divorce suit to May 3. Before adjourning the case, the judge advised the couple to explore all avenues of settlement for the sake of their children. Earlier, Mrs Okoroma told the court that, “I cannot live under the same roof with this man anymore; he and his family have ganged up against me. He threatens my life, saying that he can do anything to me and get away with it. I am no longer safe in that house.” She also alleged that her husband once called the police to arrest her for doing nothing. (NAN)
