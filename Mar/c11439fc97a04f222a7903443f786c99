A Federal High Court in Abuja has issued an interim injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from dissolving the Kano State executive of the party. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a ruling on Tuesday, granted the reliefs in the motion ex parte by the Kano executive members. The executive committee members led by Shehu Wada Sagagi, Bashir Tanko Muhammed, Ali Tijani Ansaru and Gambo Jamil Abba, are seeking to restrain the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from dissolving the executive members at the state, local government and ward levels. They also sought an order of court restraining the PDP from appointing an interim caretaker committee to run the affairs of the party in the state at the various levels until the determination of the motion on notice. There have been calls by stakeholders of the PDP in the state, represented by Dr Yusuf Dambatta and Dr Akilu Indabawa to the National Working Committee (NWC) to constitute a caretaker committee in the state to oversee the general elections. The calls were intended to block an alleged plot by the former governor of the state, Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, to control the party’s machinery, and at the same time promote another party, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Meanwhile, Justice Taiwo has fixed April 7 for hearing of the main suit.
