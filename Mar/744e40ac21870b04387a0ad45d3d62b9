The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) said it has mapped out over 300 clusters and 98 markets for its solar power projects tagged: “Energising Economies Initiative (EEI)”. In a statement by the REA spokesman, Ayang Ogbe on Wednesday, the agency held a roundtable meeting with private power developers in Abuja last week to identify the implementation gaps and other strategies to deliver the projects. The focus of the EEI is to electrify economic clusters in Nigeria – which include markets, shopping plazas/complexes and industrial clusters, in line with the federal government’s goal of increasing electricity access. The statement reads in part: “Over 300 clusters have been identified for electrification across the country in different phases. So far, over 12,000 shops are now receiving clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity supply.” The pilot phase of the EEI in 2018 saw the energising of 1,047 shops at the Sura Shopping Complex through an Independent Power Project in Lagos State; the Ariaria International Market (Independent Power Project), Aba, Abia State, powering over 4,000 shops. Also, launched were over 6,000 energised shops at Sabon Gari Market, Kano, with more connections ongoing. The phase two rollout plans are currently in view and conversations have begun between the developers, state governments and other stakeholders, it noted. REA further stated that: “Baseline surveys and energy audits are currently being conducted for 98 markets across the country. The agency is also exploring ways to secure concessionary finance and technical assistance to further support EEI developers.”
