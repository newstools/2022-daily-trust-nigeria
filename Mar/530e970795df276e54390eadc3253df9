For the past two weeks, government activities across the six area councils of the FCT have remained paralysed following a strike action embarked upon by Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE). The workers are protesting over the non-payment of their January 2022 salary. Daily Trust went round the councils’ secretariat on Monday and observed that the main gates remained locked with security men and civil defence corps guarding them. Offices at Kwali, Abaji, Kuje and Gwagwalada councils’ secretariats were all under lock while the premises were deserted. A civil servant, Alhassan Ibrahim, said since the strike action commenced two weeks ago, he decided to use his private vehicle for commercial purpose to raise money to buy food to feed his family. Another civil servant in Kuje, Solomon Yakubu, said the non-payment of their January salary by the FCT administration has caused hardship on his family. Reacting, the president of FCT branch of NULGE, Comrade Abdullahi Ibrahim Kabi, said there was no going back on the ongoing strike action until the staff January salary is paid. He said the union had resolved to mobilise its members across the six area councils to occupy FCTA on Wednesday until the FCT administration paid their members’ January salary.
