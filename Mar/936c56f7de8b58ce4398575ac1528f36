There seems to be no end in sight due to the fuel scarcity confronting the aviation sector as many morning flights were rescheduled today leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at various airports across the country. For instance, at the Murtala Muhammad Airport Lagos domestic terminals, there was chaos as virtually all the airlines rescheduled their flights.

Though the aviation fuel had been selling for N600 outside Lagos, especially in the Northern parts of Nigeria, while it was around N575-N579 last week, this is the first time it would hit N600 since the scarcity and price hike started. This has left many airline operators in a difficult situation with the drastic increase in the high cost of their operations. Passengers have become victims of the present circumstances as many flights are now rescheduled, delayed for hours and often times cancelled. Due to these recent events, many passengers at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA) domestic wing were stranded. It was gathered that Air Peace, Dana Air, Ibom Air, Arik Air, Azman, Max Air, among others have some of their morning flights rescheduled. It was also gathered that other airlines were busy attending to passengers that had their flights hitherto rescheduled in the last few days. Daily Trust reports that the House of Representatives had intervened in the Jet A1 scarcity last week by summoning the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Melee Kyari alongside airline operators and the regulatory authorities. However, the problem has not subsided since last week while the aviation fuel marketers are expected to meet the lawmakers this week.
