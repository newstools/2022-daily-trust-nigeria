Two uncles of Nigerian music star, David Adedeji Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, are set to slug it out with each other in the governorship election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State. The two members of Adeleke family- Senator Ademola Adeleke and Mr. Dele Adeleke – are among the PDP governorship aspirants participating in the Primary of Tuesday. Other as aspirants include Prince Dotun Babayemi, Alhaji Fatai Akinbade, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, and Mr Omirin Emmanuel Olusanya. Daily Trust reports that when Senator Adeleke contested the governorship election in 2018, Dele was his main agent. Back then, the PDP aspirant spent the night at the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) head office in Osun during collation of results. He, like other agents, had complained about areas they and the parties they represented were not satisfied. But surprisingly, Dele is up against Adeleke in today’s primary. There has been a division in the family of Adeleke over the governorship ambition of the duo. Davido, a prominent  member of the family is backing Ademola Adeleke, a one-time Senator. Davido in January called out Dele Adeleke, describing him as fake as the governorship ambition of the two tears the Adeleke family apart.
