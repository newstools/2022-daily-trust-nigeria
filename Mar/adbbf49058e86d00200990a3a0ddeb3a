An indigene of Kabo LGA of Kano State, Hussein Lawal, who is trekking from Abuja to Lagos in solidarity and support for the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, has arrived at Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Lawal, who arrived in Ibadan on Monday night, said while on his way, men of the Nigerian Army and commercial drivers supported him financially. Speaking with reporters in Ibadan on Tuesday, Lawal called on Nigerian youths to support Tinubu to become president in 2023. He said; “I decided to walk for Tinubu because he remains the only presidential aspirant with the youth in his heart. Tinubu has been supporting youths before he became a governor; he did it as a governor and even after he left office as a governor. “He remains the only leader who supported Nigerian youths regardless of their religion and ethnicity. Many of the youths who worked under him as a governor are now ministers and even vice president,” he said.
