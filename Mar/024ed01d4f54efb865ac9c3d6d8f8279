 The Association of Livestock Dealers of Nigeria in Oyo State on Monday alleged that the state government has neglected them despite paying N5 million as taxes on over 10,000 goats sold daily. The state president of the association, Hon. Ashirudeen Abd-Rasaq, stated this during the chieftaincy and award ceremony organised by the Iseyin local government chapter of the association. “If we can be paying N5 million daily on over 10,000 goats, do we not deserve the attention of the government like all other sectors?” he asked. “We want the government and security agencies to note this and work towards putting a stop to the neglect. “Those genuinely engaged in the trade, especially our old women who sell and buy livestock, including birds, are not allowed to do their jobs anymore and we have taken this issue to the state government, they promised to work on it. “Although we agreed that they should work on that, we have asked our members across the state to stop paying the tax of N500 for each goat because of the neglect we suffer. Reacting to the allegations, the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Hon Adeniyi Adebisi, said the ministry is no longer involved in revenue/tax collection for the government.
