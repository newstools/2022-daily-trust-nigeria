A magistrate court sitting in Nomansland area of Kano metropolis has ordered a renowned critic of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, Abdulmajid Danbilki Kwamanda, to be remanded in prison. He was remanded for three count charges bordering on alleged character assassination of the governor. Kwamanda was said to have alleged that Ganduje bribed the Mai Mala Buni-led All Progressives Congress (APC) national leadership to enable his factional leader, Abdullahi Abbas, to get the party’s certificate of return as Kano chairman. The presiding judge, Aminu Magashi, on Tuesday ordered Kwamanda to be remanded in a correctional centre after declining the defence counsels’ prayer of granting him bail. The defendant however pleaded not guilty. The judge then adjourned the case to March 15, 2022, and ordered the defendant to be remanded till then. Earlier in January this year, another critic and former Ganduje’s commissioner, Mu’az Magaji, was remanded for a similar offence, before he was granted bail.
