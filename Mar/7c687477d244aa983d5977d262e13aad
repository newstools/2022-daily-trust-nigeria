Two years after the purported construction of the multi-million naira swimming pool at Ekwueme Square, Awka, Anambra State, it is yet to be completed and made functional. The project took off in the wake of the 12th edition of the biennial Police Games held in the state from February 29 to March 7, 2020. The swimming pool, which is supposed to help the state host swimming athletes, is now dry and taken over by snakes and other reptiles. City & Crime reports that the pool, which was hurriedly put up to serve the police games, was not completed before the end of the games. The swimming competition was only held for a day instead of two days during the game due to the unhealthy condition of the pool, which was at tiling level a day to the competition. Our correspondent in the state gathered that during the games, tankers were hired to fill the pool which was allegedly built at the cost of N52 million. A recent visit to the site of the swimming pool by our correspondent shows that instead of completing the pool, the interlocking bricks are being removed. A sports writer in the state, Mr. Patrick Chimezie, described the non-completion of the project as a monumental waste to the state resources. He expressed worry over how the state embarked on such a wasteful venture when there was a place to have swimming competition at Rojenny games village in Oba, Idemili South LGA of the state. The chairman of Anambra Sports Development Commission, Chief Tony Oli, had promised that the swimming pool would be completed and put to public use.
