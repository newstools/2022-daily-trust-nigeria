An insurance firm has supported over 200 female entrepreneurs through capacity building and financial support. AXA Mansard provided the support through a capacity development conference organised by SME 100 Africa, in commemoration of International Women’s Day. SME 100 Africa is a social enterprise that supports young African entrepreneurs along their journey towards professional success. Speaking during the conference, Chief Client Officer, AXA Mansard, Rashidat Adebisi, said collaborating with SME 100 to empower SMEs is another way in the series of programmes and initiatives that AXA Mansard is using to inspire and empower women. According to her, AXA Mansard’s commitment to SMEs is not just about the ripple effect it will have on the economy, it is also about the gap that it will bridge. “And empowering these brilliant business owners around the International Women’s Day, is our way of raising the awareness about the different socio-economic possibilities of unlocking the potentials of women either in business, career or other social endeavours,” she said.
