Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited has launched its tomato paste variant into the Nigerian market. The new tomato paste variant, packaged in a 65g sachet, is produced directly from fresh tomatoes grown in the country, thereby guaranteeing superior flavour and colour. It is the company’s first consumer product since the commencement of operations at its multi-billion naira factory in Kaduna State last year. First City Monument Bank (FCMB), in 2019, financed the construction of Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited’s state-of-the-art tomato paste processing plant located at Kangimi in Kaduna State. The funding was through the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) intervention fund to procure plants and machinery for the factory. Speaking at the event to unveil the Tomato Jos sachet variant, the managing director of the company, Mira Mehta, said, “The facility is the only one of its kind in Nigeria that can produce sachet tomato products directly from fresh tomatoes. The product is currently available throughout Kaduna State, and we intend to expand to more states by the end of 2022.” Also commenting on the development, the managing director of FCMB, Mrs Yemisi Edun, described the bank’s funding of the factory as another landmark intervention to boost agribusiness, food security and food sufficiency in Nigeria.
