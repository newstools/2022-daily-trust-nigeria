A former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the national, zonal and state youth leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to begin the process of mobilising their peers across the nation to select leaders that would meet the aspirations of young people. While delivering his remarks at a youth leaders’ summit organised by the PDP National Youth Leader, Prince Mohammed Kadede Sulaiman, Saraki reiterated the need for more young people to have seats in the next government.

Therefore, the only way we can be functional is to ensure that young people and women are fully integrated at the onset in all our strategies,” Saraki was quoted as saying in a statement by his media office in Abuja. Saraki reminded the youth leaders that there were over 18 million Nigerian youths who were not yet registered to vote, saying, “We need you all to go out there and give these young people a reason to register to vote. You need to start mobilising at the ward, state, and zonal levels. “And of course, it goes without saying, at this time, young people should not only come out to vote, they should also come out and vie for elective positions. With the new electoral act, it is clear that we will have freer and fairer elections — and only young people can and will win,” Saraki said.
