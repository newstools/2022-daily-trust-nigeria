Prof. Abba Sheshe, the Chief Medical Director, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), says the hospital will soon establish the first Geriatrics Service Centre in Northern Nigeria. Sheshe said this on Tuesday while receiving members of a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Elderly Care Support Initiative, who paid him a courtesy visit. “Geriatrics is a field of medicine which deals with advanced medical care of elderly patients and social interventions needed by the aged patients.’’ Earlier, the founder of the NGO, Dr Anas Ibrahim, said the aim of the visit was to engage the hospital management and community on care for the aged and elderly.
