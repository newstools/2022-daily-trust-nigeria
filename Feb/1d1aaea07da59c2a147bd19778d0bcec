The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the harassment of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, at the Makurdi Airforce base, saying the action was a threat to the unity and peaceful coexistence of the country. The party described the incident as a vicious attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to “embarrass, harass, unsettle Governor Ortom and sustain the terrorization of the people of Benue State in the desperation to sequester their constitutional and ancestral heritage.” Debo Ologunagba, PDP National Publicity Secretary, said the presidency cannot deny involvement in the provocative act “because all arms of the armed forces, including the Air Force, are under the authority and control of the Commander-in-Chief, who is the head of the Executive arm to which the vice president also belongs.”
