A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP), Dr. Abdulfattah Durojaiye, Thursday said his party will wrest power from the two leading political parties in the country –All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) – in the 2023 general elections. He said the party would engage the passive majority of Nigerian registered voters. Dr. Abdulfattah told newsmen in Kano that time was ripe for Nigerians to put their fate elsewhere, saying APC and PDP have failed the country since return to democracy in 1999. “The leverage of the common people will propel us. How many people voted in the elections that produced President Muhammadu Buhari? In the last election, we have between 50 to 70 million that collected their Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) but did not show up during the election in 2019. “These are the powerful majority of Nigerians that have lost interest in the process because repeatedly they have discovered that the political class continued to short-change them. “Nigerians are at the crossroads, we are at the brink now. We are going to engage (this powerful majority) and bring our youths out.” The APC and PDP spokesmen could not be immediately reached for comments as of the time of filing this report.
