Citizens Unite, a pressure group, was yesterday inaugurated in Lagos to pressurise Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to join the 2023 presidential race. Leader of the group and convener of the event, Dr Maryam Shettima, said Nigeria needed thoroughbred professionals, academics, intellectuals, loyal politicians and emphatic citizens at the helm of its national affairs. She said Osinbajo met all the criteria required in a leader that would govern Nigeria in 2023, hence the reason the group was urging him to contest. She noted that they would not stop pressurising him until he declared his intention. Shettima said, “We believe that Osinbajo has what it takes to usher Nigeria into a new age. We will continue to pressurise him to declare his intention to run. “At Citizen’s Unite, we concern ourselves with the strategic and intellectual bits of national politics.” Shettima observed that working as a physiotherapist at the State House Clinic in 2012- 2013, she had the privilege of coming across various people in leadership positions and that the vice president stood out in humility, charisma and was approachable. “Not only is the vice president a visionary professional technocrat, he is God fearing, quick to act, bridge builder, compassionate, down to earth family man with street credibility just as we witnessed with the Trader Moni and even more in his visit to Borno on Friday,” she said.
