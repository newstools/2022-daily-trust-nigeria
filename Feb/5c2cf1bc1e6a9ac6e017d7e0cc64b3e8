President Muhammadu Buhari has confirmed Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). This confirmation was conveyed in a statement signed by the Director Press, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Mr Eric Ojiekwe. With this confirmation, the speculation as to status of the embatled erstwhile Managing Director of the NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala Usman has been rested. She is now officially relieved of that position. Recall Ms Usman was suspended some eight months ago by President Buhari over allegations bothering on financial impropriety. A Ministerial panel was set up by the Minister of Transportation,  Mr Rotimi Amaechi to investigate her alleged wrong-doing but the committee hasn’t turned in its report. Mr Bello-Koko was the immediate past Executive Director,  Finance and Administration of the Authority and has been acting as the MD since the uncelebrated exit of Ms Hadiza Bala Usman.
