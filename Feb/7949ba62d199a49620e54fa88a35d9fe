The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Imo State, Prof. Francis Chukwuemeka Ezeonu, has said 11 political parties are to participate in the by-election for Ngor Okpala state constituency. The state House of Assembly had declared the seat vacant citing the inability of the former occupant to perform his legislative duties. The by-election is scheduled for Saturday February 26. Ezeonu said a total of 94,040 voters are expected to vote in 193 polling units. While expressing readiness of the commission to undertake the exercise, Ezeonu said it will be engaging about 800 ad hoc staff, including senior polling officers, polling officers and assistant polling officers. He said all electoral materials have arrived in the state, adding that non-sensitive materials have been supplied to Ngor Okpala and completely batched ready for deployment.
