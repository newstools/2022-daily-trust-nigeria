The police in Ogun State have arrested the pastor in charge of Life and Power Bible Church in Ogijo, Mathew Oladapo, for raping a 19-year-old member of the church. Pastor Oladajo was arrested following a report lodged at the Ogijo Police Division in Sagamu Local Government Area of the state by the victim. The girl (name withheld) told the police that during church service last Sunday, the pastor told her that he saw a vision that she had a spiritual husband, hence she needed to be delivered. According to her, the pastor told her that she would undergo a three-night fasting and prayer in the church for total deliverance, and that he asked her to come to the church with a N1,000 note and anointing oil. She explained that on the first night of the fasting and prayer, she was taken to a room where the pastor ordered her to pull off her clothes and lie down on the floor. “While on the floor, the pastor started rubbing the anointing oil on my body and inserted his finger into my private part. “When I protested, the pastor pinned me down, covered my mouth and forcefully had sex with me with the claim that it was the only way to break the bond between me and the spirit husband,” the girl told the police. The police spokesman in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Wednesday told newsmen in Abeokuta that following the report, the police went to the church and arrested the pastor. Mr Oyeyemi said, “On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime and claimed to have been overwhelmed by the spirit.” Oyeyemi said the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID).
