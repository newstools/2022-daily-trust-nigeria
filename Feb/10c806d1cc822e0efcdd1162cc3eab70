The Chairman/CEO of Geometric Power Ltd, Professor Barth Nnaji, has told the Abia State government that their power plant has a capacity to produce 140 megawatts of electricity which is more than enough to provide steady and sustainable power to Aba and its environs. Professor Nnaji and his wife disclosed this when they received the governor on a courtesy visit to the facility at the Osisioma Industrial Layout on Wednesday. Nnaji said: “Currently, the entire Aba gets a maximum of 50 megawatts of power from the national grid but the plant has a capacity to produce 140 megawatts of electricity which is more than enough to provide steady and sustainable power to Aba and its environs. “Basically, all the required support infrastructure is in place, including the 17km pipeline that takes gas from Owaza in Ukwa West LGA to the plant and six months from now, the plant will be commissioned for the supply of power to the people of Abia State.” Prof Nnaji stated that long before the contractual problem that led to the stalling of the project, 500 million dollars had already been invested in the project, adding that it was the largest economic project in the entire South East of Nigeria. He said Abia State Government owns 5% equity in the project. Governor Ikpeazu described the Geometric Power Project as the “fulcrum upon which the industrial development of Abia, Abia State and the South East will revolve.” According to the governor, “two years from today, the story of economic development in Aba and Abia State will take a completely different turn. Things will never be the same again around here and anyone who hasn’t concluded plans to have a presence here is already late.”
