The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has called for the active and peaceful participation of FCT residents in the forthcoming FCT Area Council elections, scheduled to hold on Saturday. In a message to FCT residents, Malam Bello, said that since the return to democracy in 1999, the FCT Area Council elections have held unfailingly every three years leading to the entrenchment of an enduring democratic culture where the wishes of the people have prevailed. He called on them to maintain this enviable tradition by abiding by all extant rules and regulations guiding the polls in a peaceful manner. He however warned would-be trouble makers that the security agencies are under strict directives to bring the full weight of the law on errant individuals or groups who may attempt to breach the peace in whatever guise. He therefore called on parents, traditional, community and religious leaders to caution their wards, subjects and members of their congregation against engaging in acts that could disrupt the peaceful conduct of the elections.
