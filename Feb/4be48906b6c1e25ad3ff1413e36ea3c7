The Bauchi State Shariah Commission has flagged off a skills empowerment training of 575 commercial sex workers operating in the state to discourage them from prostitution and make them self-reliant The training, which is being done by the Hisbah Department of the Bauchi State Shariah Commission, will empower the commercial sex workers in tailoring, hairdressing, make-up, catering, cosmetology, poultry, fishery, computer literacy and micro-enterprise enhancement. The Permanent Commissioner in charge of Hisbah and Shariah Matters, Barrister Aminu Isa, said the training would last for three months. The Commissioner for Religious Affairs, Umar Kesa, said the training was government’s fulfilment to the commercial sex workers during the headcount that was done last year.
