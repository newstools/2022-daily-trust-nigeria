Former House of Representatives Forum members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have said shutting out some statutory delegates to the February 26, 2022 national convention will spell doom for the party. In the proposed new constitution, the party had bared members of the National Assembly – who are not principal officers – from taking part in the convention and presidential primary as delegates. But the proposal was reversed in an advertorial on Wednesday, signed by Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe. The Ex-Reps members in a statement by their protem chairman, Hon Ibrahim Zailani, said the earlier proposal if ratified would have affected the party negatively. “We hereby reiterate our plea to the leadership of the party that as a progressive entity, the onus is on our party to lead the way in espousing progressive ideologies chief of which is the institutionalisation of internal democracy. “Anything short of this would mean no good for the unity and progress of our party. We, in the meantime, place our unalloyed loyalty and support to the CECPC and the party,” they said.
