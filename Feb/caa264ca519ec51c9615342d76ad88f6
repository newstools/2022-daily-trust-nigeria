A group under the aegis of Kano South Concern Citizens Forum (KSCCF) has insisted that it is the turn of the zone to produce the next governor of the state. The forum endorsed the member representing Rano, Kibiya and Bunkure Federal constituency and the Chairman, House Committee on pension, Alhassan Rurum, to run for the office of Kano state governor in the 2023 general elections. A communiqué issued by the forum on Sunday stated that Kano South deserved a fair share of the exalted political post.

Alhassan Ado Doguwa to be re-elected as the Member Tudun Wada/Doguwa so that he would have a chance to become the Speaker of the House. The Chairman of the forum, Alh. Musa Salihu, argued that Kano South had not been given a chance to produce a governor for the state since 1992, saying, “Kano South has largest local government councils among others in Kano with 16. “Kano North and Kano Central produced governors. In 2023, the governorship position should be zoned to Kano South for it to have a fair share of the exalted political post. Kano South has a vital role to play in building Kano State as the zone is ready to give its best for the purpose. “We, therefore, endorse Alhassan Rurum for governor in 2023 to succeed Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. And since we are basing our argument on competency, Hon. Kawu Sumaila should be elected Senator Kano South and Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa be re-elected as the Member Tudunwada Doguwa so that he will have a chance to become the Speaker of the house.”
