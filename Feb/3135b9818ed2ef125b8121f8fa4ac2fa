German Technical and Vocational Education (SKYE/GIZ) and the Ogun State Technical and Vocational Education Board have agreed to train students across the primary, secondary and tertiary institutions in the state on solar power installation and other crafts. Leader of the SKYE/GIZ team, Dr Karsten Feverriegel, who disclosed this in Abeokuta during a courtesy visit to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Technical and Vocational Education and Training, Prof Joseph Odemuyiwa. Dr Feverriegel stated that the team would use the German model where highly skilled workers and engineers depended on each other for greater output to provide more practical skills to instructors and teachers. He said, “The state is a powerhouse of industries in Nigeria, and we will synergise with the government to get it to contribute content-wise because they know best what they need in terms of manpower. I believe there is a need for a review of strategy for a successful outcome.” Responding, Prof Odemuyiwa said the partnership was in tandem with the drive of the present administration on technical and vocational education. He said, “We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with about 25 industries across the state for a smooth take off of the programme. “It is also in our plans to ensure that students learn a minimum of one trade in all our over 500 secondary schools in Ogun State. We are starting with the 42 flagship secondary schools, including the tertiary institutions, regardless of the course of study.” Also speaking, the Executive Secretary of TVET, Mr Akinleye Olubori, appreciated the team, saying the government was working together with the World Bank to revamp the sector and address apathy for TVET on the part of the youths.
