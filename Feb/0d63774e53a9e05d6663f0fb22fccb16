The Chairman, BUA Group of Companies, Alhaji Abdulsamad Isyaku Rabiu, has promised Nigerians that the company will not increase the price of its products now or during the upcoming Ramadan period. BUA’s representative in the northern region, Alhaji Muhammadu Adakawa, disclosed this during a press briefing held in Kano to address the recent increase of prices of products by some companies. He said the chairman of BUA Group of Companies had asked him to tell Nigerians that it would maintain the current prices of its products all through the upcoming Ramadan fasting period. Alhaji Adakawa also noted that recently some companies have implemented an increase of N1500 on a 50kg of refined sugar but he assured that BUA would not follow suit. “This year, the management of BUA Group of Companies finds it important to listen and respond to its customers’ appeal not to follow others in the recent increase of its products, especially sugar. “Therefore, the management has instructed me to let the public know that it will not increase its product’s price now and also through the Ramadan period,” he said.
