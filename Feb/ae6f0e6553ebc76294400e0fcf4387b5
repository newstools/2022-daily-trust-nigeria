The Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has commissioned a 420 metric tons per day mega rice mill in Kano State constructed by Gerawa Group of Companies. Speaking during the commissioning of the mill and the foundation laying of additional 560 metric tons rice mill, the CBN governor stated that before 2015, Nigeria has less than 10 functional integrated mills with a combined capacity of less than 350, 000 metric tons, but with the coming of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, the statistic has grown to over 60 integrated mills with a combined capacity of over N3 million metric tons. The CBN governor added that there are about 10 new integrated mills scheduled to be commissioned this year, adding that the growing number of integrated mills has been complemented by hundreds of small scale mills located across the states of the federation in an effort towards the nation’s food security. Speaking during the occasion, Chairman, Gerawa Group of Companies, Alhaji Isa Muhammed Gerawa stated that the establishment of the rice mill has been a testimony of the efficacy of the federal government’s agricultural development policies that encourage farming and other related activities with support from the CBN. He added that the intended 560 metric tons capacity rice mill will be completed in November, 2022. The financier of the project, Fidelity Bank, said it was proud to be associated with the project because of its potential to not only improve the lives of many small-holder farmers in Kano, Jigawa and environs but to also develop the country’s rice value chain and ensure food security. Speaking through its Managing Director/CEO, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, who was represented at the event by its Executive Director, Northern Businesses, Hassan Imam, said it has facilitated the disbursement of over N34 billion in direct credit to players in the value chain. While laying the foundation of the 560 metric tons capacity mill, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje stated that Kano State being the most populated state in the country has provided a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. He added that Kano State government will continue to support investments that will ensure economic growth and national development.
