The Repositioning Group of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, has told a former governor of the state, Engr Segun Oni, that its members are still active members of the PDP and are working hard for the party’s victory in the June 18, 2022 governorship election in Ekiti State. In a statement yesterday, chairman of the group in Ekiti State, Engr Alaba Agboola, said there was nowhere the group met with Oni, or his agents to discuss a grand coalition. “Members of the Ekiti PDP Repositioning Group are not political harlots who move from parties to parties and as such cannot be part of any coalition with Oni, who obviously came to the PDP from the APC just for the purpose of using the PDP platform to contest the election. “Most importantly, two aspirants from the Repositioning Group, Otunba Yinka Akerele and Alhaji Lateef Ajijola, who contested the PDP primary election are fully with the party’s candidate. “Therefore, members of the Repositioning Group are in PDP and in PDP will they remain and work with other members and supporters of the party to win the June 18 governorship election,” he said.
