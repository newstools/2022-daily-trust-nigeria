More details emerged on Wednesday about the clash between hoodlums that left one person shot and several others injured in Ilorin, Kwara State. The clash between rival groups in Adeta and Isale-Jagun communities in Ilorin West LGA which began on Sunday night grounded social and commercial activities in the areas for two days. It was gathered that trouble started when a girl (name withheld) who absconded from home for days and was declared missing by her family was sighted at a party by her brother. But that the order for her to return home by her brother did not go down well with her boyfriend who brought her to the party. “Her brother’s insistence that she must leave the party that night led to a disagreement that snowballed to a free-for-all,” a source said. During the two-day bloody confrontation that followed, over 10 cars were vandalised and many people sustained bullet injuries and machete cuts. Meanwhile, another attempt by the hoodlums to resume attacks last night was quelled by the police. The spokesman of the police in the state, Ajayi Okasanmi, said three suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident and investigation was ongoing.
