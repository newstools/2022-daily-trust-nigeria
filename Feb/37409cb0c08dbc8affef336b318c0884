The acting Executive Chairman of the Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service (FCT-IRS), Mr Haruna Y. Abdullahi, has said funding FCT budget 100 per cent from Internal Generated Revenue (IGR) is possible with collaboration and synergy with other revenue-generating agencies in the territory. In a statement by Mustapha Sumaila, Head Corporate Communications of FCT-IRS, Mr Abdullahi stated this when he received a delegation from the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) led by its Director, Alhaji Wadata Aliyu Bodinga. Mr Abdullahi explained that the service had been championing the course of harmonising revenue from all revenue-generating agencies in the FCT with a view to blocking leakages, addressing multiple taxations and growing the revenue base in the FCT. The chairman, who noted that the effort would make the FCT have the capacity to fund its budget through IGR solely, said, “We hope to see that FCTA will fund its budget 100 per cent from IGR so that whatever comes from the federal government as allocation will be a surplus for them.” In his remarks, the DRTS Director, Bodinga, said the visit was targeted at three major areas: collaboration, support and training. Meanwhile, a committee has been constituted to articulate and harmonise areas of possible collaboration between the two organisations with a view to boosting revenue collection.
