The joint caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the National Assembly has endorsed the presidential aspiration of a former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, come 2023. Speaking at a consultative meeting between the presidential hopeful and members of the PDP caucus in Abuja, Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe (PDP, Abia) said the members of the caucus were solidly behind Anyim’s quest to become president of the country. “The PDP joint caucus of the National Assembly is telling you to go ahead with your aspiration. As elected representatives of the people and also those in touch with the grassroots, we are with you,” he said. Abaribe stated that usually, the National Assembly is taken for granted when people sought for executive positions. “But you have shown that as a former presiding officer of the National Assembly, you have taken the right step.” Speaking earlier, Anyim said he wanted to meet with his primary constituency, the National Assembly, which will give him direction on what to do. He said he decided to seek the office of the president of the country on behalf of the members of the National Assembly, adding that they will be the ones to tell him to continue or not.
