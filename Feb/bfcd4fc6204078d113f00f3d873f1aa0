A former senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki, on Thursday, consulted a former vice president, Namadi Sambo; a former governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi and other stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over his 2023 presidential ambition. Saraki also met with a former governor of Kaduna State, Alhaji Mukhtar Ramalan Yero, and executive members of the Kaduna State chapter of the PDP. The presidential hopeful was represented on the consultation tour by the chairman, Contact and Mobilisation Committee of Abubakar Bukola Saraki for 2023 Presidency, Professor Iyorwuese Hagher, and other members of the committee. Addressing PDP members at the party’s state secretariat in Kaduna, the Second Republic senator, Professor Hagher, said Nigerians were sick and tired of APC, adding that, “If Saraki is voted into power, he would ensure a healthy nation. “The presidency under Saraki will be a double blessing for the country for the fact that he is a medical doctor, young and energetic, who is ready to listen to the yearnings of the citizens. “Nigerians are sick and tired of APC, strange bed fellows that came together to bring hardship on Nigerians through civilian dictatorship. “PDP is well organised. It will defeat APC. Saraki will be accepted by the North and South. He is well educated. Now that Nigeria is sick, it needs Abubakar Bukola Saraki because he is a medical doctor.” Responding, the state chairman of the PDP, Mr Hassan Hyat, described Saraki as a humble, gentle and responsible leader.
