A coalition of groups in Northern Nigeria with links to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is canvassing support for Malam Saliu Mustapha as the next chairman of the party. The group said they threw their weight behind Mustapha based on President Muhammadu Buhari’s declaration to support younger elements in the party to pick party positions. In a communiqué they signed, Comrade Isah Abubakar of the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria and Salihu Danlami of Arewa Youths Assembly (AYA), argued that the youngest among the major APC chairmanship aspirants, Mustapha will bridge the gap between the older presidential hopefuls and youth demography which constitute over 50% of the voting population. They urge APC stakeholders, including the president, to trust Saliu Mustapha with their mandate.
