The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has partnered the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) in capacity building and compliance with procurement processes. The Managing Director/Chief Executive of NDIC, Mr Bello Hassan, who spoke at a two-day management retreat held in Lagos at the weekend, noted that the programme offers opportunities to engage the BPP as well as keep abreast with the development in the procurement processes. “The aim of this management retreat is to ensure that participants acquaint themselves with salient provisions of the Public Procurement Act, 2007 and to have a greater understanding of the procurement processes. The desire for continued engagement and partnership with a critical Stakeholder like the bureau stands as my unequivocal commitment and determination to ensure that the corporation discharges its mandate successfully to the benefit of depositors and the nation’s financial system as a whole,” he said. Bello stressed that the retreat would give an in-depth view of the processes and issues emanating in Public Procurement Management as well as critical issues to be addressed in order for the corporation to effectively implement its public policy objectives and achieve its ultimate vision of becoming one of the best deposit insurers in the world.
