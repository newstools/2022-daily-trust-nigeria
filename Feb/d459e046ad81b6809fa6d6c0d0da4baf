Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has charged young Nigerians to get involved in the nation’s political decision-making process to place the country on the path of sustainable growth and development. He gave the charge on Tuesday when he received the publisher of Ovation Magazine, Mr. Dele Momodu, who was on a courtesy visit to his office to inform the governor of his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Obaseki attributed the nation’s socio-economic problems to the failure of citizens to participate in the process of electing leaders. According to him, the process of electing leaders should not be left for those that don’t know the new order but feel they know something that will not take us anywhere. Earlier, Momodu said Nigeria needs only leaders with the requisite knowledge to solve her challenges.
