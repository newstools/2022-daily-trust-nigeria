The ruling APC in Cross River State has threatened to stop Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State from entering Cross River State for political activities. The National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has appointed Wike and his Akwa Ibom counterpart, Udom Emmanuel  to lead a 22-man campaign council for this weekend’s Ogoja Yala federal and Akpabuyo state constituencies by-election in the state. Chairman of APC in the state, Alphonsus Ogar, who spoke to journalists at the APC headquarters in Calabar, said the state will no longer condone his meddlesomeness as it is not an extension of Rivers State. He alleged that Wike is set to import political cannibalism into Cross River which has been a safe political haven before now. “Nyesom Wike has been a constant meddlesome interloper and today we want to say that enough is enough. “He was here on Saturday to incite violence in Cross River State but it took the maturity of our leader and governor, Professor Ben Ayade, to avert violence. “What he has set to do over time is to import the political cannibalism from Rivers State politics into Cross River State. “Cross Riverians will no longer continue to allow him to cross the boundary of the line of political decency,” he said. Eba further alleged that Wike was behind the vandalisation of the fence of the Calabar Sports Club to stage a rally in the state against police advice last weekend. “We are a peace-loving people and very decent and civilised and led by two very prominent professors. “We will not get so low to the level of a governor that is almost like a motor park tout,” he said.
