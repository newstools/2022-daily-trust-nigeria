The Host Communities of Nigeria Producing Oil and Gas (HOSCON) says it has agreed to partner with the federal government on the construction of the three pilot modular refineries in each of the oil producing communities. This was disclosed in a communiqué after the 2022 fact-finding annual conference of the HOSCON, a statement by the association said. The association said the modular refineries would be constructed with part of the expected Gas Flare Penalty Tax Fund. It said the conference had also resolved to include a broad representation of all the HOSCON states in its Board of Trustees including representatives of women, youths, and traditional rulers. Meanwhile, HOSCON said it has elected Professor Jasper F. Jumbo, a founding father of OMPADEC and NDDC, as its National Chairman and Dr Christie Atako as the new National Woman Leader. “The conference dissolved all Adhoc and Interim Committees of the PIA Trust Fund set up across the host communities by Prince Mike Emuh, and further affirmed the removal of Mr. Mike Emuh and members of his Executive Council, their tenure having expired.’’ “The conference which was attended by representatives of the Federal Government, major landlords to oil and gas companies and members of the host communities from Anambra, Enugu, Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Abia, Imo, Cross River, Ondo and River States took far reaching decisions with a view to ensuring a peaceful and environmental friendly atmosphere as well as satisfactory corporate social responsibilities of the oil companies in their operations’’, it said.
