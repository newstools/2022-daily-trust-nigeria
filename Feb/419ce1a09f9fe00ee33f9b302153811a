The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is working to launch an application that will boost the handling of electricity consumers’ complaints in its bid to strengthen its partnership with the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC). At the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by both commissions in Abuja, NERC Chairman, Engr Sanusi Garba, said the new pact would ensure operators delivered improved services to electricity consumers. Garba said, “I think the most prevalent complaint we have in the sector today is either the issue of remittance, estimated billing, lack or out of service completely, or it’s inadequacy and so on. “And all these can be tied to the legacy issues that the industry has been battling with, and also what the reform agenda was intended to address.” The Executive Vice Chairman of FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the pact marked the start of how the industry was regulated from a consumer protection standpoint and from a competition standpoint.
