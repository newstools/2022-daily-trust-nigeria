Following the wave of insecurity across the South East zone, particularly the Monday sit-at-home order, the Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (ECCIMA), has emphasised that the 33rd Enugu International Trade Fair “will be very heavily protected” by various security agencies in the state. The ECCIMA President, Chief Jasper Nduagwuike, disclosed this while briefing newsmen on the 33rd Enugu International Trade Fair scheduled for 25th March to 4th April, 2022 at the permanent site of the International Trade Fair complex, Golf Estate, Enugu. He described the Monday sit-at-home as “a very unfortunate situation.” The theme of this year’s international trade fair is ‘Opening the Nigeria Business Windows for Competitiveness in the Emerging Global Market’, and the period of the event will involve two Mondays – March 28 and April 4. Daily Trust reports that although the proscribed pro-Biafra group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has repeatedly announced through its spokesman, Mr Emma Powerful, the cancellation of the order in the zone, the people of the area still stayed in-doors on Mondays for fear of being attacked by armed miscreants who enforce the order. Reacting to the development which is not unlikely to affect this year’s Enugu International trade fair, the ECCIMA president restated that the event would be very heavily protected as the heads of all the security agencies in the state had given the chamber strong assurance to provide them adequate security. Nduagwuike said: “I can tell you that the trade fair will be very heavily protected by the various security agencies.
