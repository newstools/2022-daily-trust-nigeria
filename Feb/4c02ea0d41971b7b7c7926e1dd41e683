Nigeria will start evacuating its citizens who are trapped in the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, disclosed this at a meeting with the Speaker House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Monday. He said Nigeria had concluded arrangements to begin the evacuation of the citizens who have crossed into other countries as a result of the ongoing conflict. He assured that planes would be dispatched to those countries to begin the evacuation of Nigerians. He said: “We hope to start evacuation hopefully Wednesday… We are doing everything possible to ensure that come Wednesday, we will dispatch planes for evaluation”. Onyeama, however, dismissed the allegations of racism and discrimination against Nigerians and other blacks trying to cross the Ukrainian border to other countries for safety. He added: “The advice then was for Nigerians to stay put, but as soon as the air strike started, most people started advancing towards the borders and this caused huge backlog of people who were walking 37 kilometers to the Polish border. “And when I started hearing stories of racism and discrimination, I called the Ukrainian Minister and he said it had nothing to do with race.”
