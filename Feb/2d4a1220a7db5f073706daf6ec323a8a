The Senator Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano has accused the National Secretariat of the party of bias in the power tussle between it and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s group. The Shekarau group known as G-7 said after its loss at the appeal court, the party leadership rushed to issue certificate of return to the governor’s faction. Kano APC crisis: Ganduje floors Shekarau, Barau at appeal court Kano APC crisis: Shekarau-led faction heads to Supreme Court In a statement jointly signed by members of the group, they said it took them by surprise when the National leadership of the party failed to recognise their leader when he was thrice declared winner by the FCT High Court. “For more than 40 days after the judgement of the FCT High Court, the leadership refused to give recognition to the victorious party despite efforts to make them see reason to do so in obedience to the rule of law.” “Conversely, however, barely few hours after the judgement of the court of Appeal, on the same day, we saw the leadership giving certificate to the person who emerged victorious in the appeal. All courts should necessarily earn equal respect from citizens. “It is in this regards that, we in very strong terms, urged our supporters, throughout Kano state and beyond to remain calm and focused because our lawyers have immediately commenced the processes of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nigeria, being dissatisfied with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.” While appreciating the efforts of the National Secretariat of the party in trying to move the party forward, the G-7 said much is still needed from them in terms of building stronger confidence in the party members. “We humbly and respectfully urged our party leaders to always take the right actions to protect the party’s electoral viability. party members should be inspired by the disciplined commitment of the party leaders to support and implement lawful decisions.”
