 The Enugu Rescue Group (ERG) has faulted a former governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani, for saying that a purported zoning arrangement had knocked a former deputy president of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, off the 2023 governorship contest in the state. Nnamani had in a statement commended what he claimed to be a “principled stand” of some critical stakeholders in the state “affirming the zoning principle as well as the turn of Enugu East zone to produce the next governor.” “This position of Enugu elders may have put paid to the governorship ambition of the former deputy president of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, from Enugu West Senatorial Zone,” Nnamani was quoted to have said. But reacting, yesterday, the National Co-ordinator of the group, Hon. Ejike Iloh, said “We have observed the reckless utterances and claims of Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani and wonder when he became the spokesperson of all former governors and Enugu political leaders. “We make bold to say that by verifiable records on the contests for the governorship of Enugu State since 1998/1999, there is nothing like zoning principle in the state. Power has gone round the three geopolitical zones, but not based on any predefined zoning principle, as Nnamani seeks to sell to unsuspecting Nigerians. “We, therefore, wish to remind Nnamani that, that God is still alive to teach people, who take pleasure in playing God, some bitter lessons,” he said.
