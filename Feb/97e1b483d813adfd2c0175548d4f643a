The House of Representatives has threatened to involve all relevant authorities against estate developers in Abuja that flout any rule or encroach on prohibited areas. The Chairman, House Ad-Hoc Committee on the Investigation of Operations of Real Estate Developers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Blessing Onu (APC, Benue) said this when members of the committee visited various sites in Abuja on Thursday. She alleged that they have discovered various infractions by the developers like building without relevant authorization from the government, encroaching on prohibited areas, taking over government lands designated for special purposes as well as failure to deliver to their subscribers. Onuh said the committee would analyze its findings regarding the various infractions by developers and involve relevant authorities to deal with the issue appropriately. She added: “What we have discovered is so mind-boggling. There are a lot of contraventions, a lot of infractions by the developers in some of the places we visited. “They do not have building plan approvals. No documents like where we are here in EFAB. No titled documents. “All EFAB could present to this committee is just a lease agreement of 2003. There is so much going on here and it is quite unfortunate and we promise that this committee is going to do something about it. “We would look at the infractions, analyze them and then we would send those that have infractions and contraventions to the necessary authority for intervention.”
