The federal government, in partnership with the Ogun State Government, has commenced the distribution of free Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) certificate to over 6,500 successful Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which applied through the Formalisation Track of the MSMEs Survival Fund. Speaking during a symbolic presentation ceremony in Abeokuta, Ogun State, to herald the distribution to beneficiaries drawn from the 20 LGAs of the state, Gov Dapo Abiodun said his administration’s genuine commitment to providing economic support to MSMEs, especially the vulnerable, made the state key into the federal government’s Survival Fund towards increasing productivity and output of micro-enterprises. Gov Abiodun, represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Tokunbo Talabi, said the state had embarked on the distribution of grants to artisans and business owners in recent times but found out that a lot of business owners could have benefitted but for lack of business registration. He said, “That is why we have put this together to facilitate your registration and create wealth for MSMEs, especially those who cannot afford it.”
