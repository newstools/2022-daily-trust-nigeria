A group under the umbrella of Push 4 Emefiele 2023 Presidency has called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to contest the 2023 presidential election. It said his emergence would ensure economic prosperity and sustainable development in the country. Addressing newsmen Thursday in Benin, the national coordinator of the group, Prestly Okojie, said the group zeroed on Emefiele because he has distinguished himself as a competent and reliable leader as CBN governor. “He didn’t tell us to push for him but we have looked at his antecedents and settled for him as a reliable and credible person for the presidency. “Emefiele’s intervention initiative as CBN governor brought the nation out of recession twice, and he also initiated programmes such as Anchor Borrower, loan to traders for businesses as well as creating CBN bond targeting N2 billion in forex sales. “For President Buhari to retain him as CBN governor showed that he is a performer and has integrity. So, we see him as the best person for the presidency come 2023,” the group said.
