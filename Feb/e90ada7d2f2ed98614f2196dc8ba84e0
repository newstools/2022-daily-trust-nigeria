Members of the Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to the minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on Wednesday resorted to prayer over alleged maltreatment by the national leadership of the party. At an event themed, ‘God Save APC in Kwara State’, Sheikh Shuaib Cisse and Reverend Gabriel Olaoye led prayers for unity in the party and successful general elections come 2023. The party also used the occasion to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari in choosing a right and credible successor come 2023. Various speakers at the event, attended by 193 ward chairmen, 16 local government chairmen and youth in the party, as well as party stalwarts, lamented that they remained marginalised and disenfranchised despite complaints lodged with the national leadership of the party. According to them, the ongoing crisis in the party portends grave danger for its fortunes in 2023 and subsequent elections in the state. The war of attrition rocking the party, they noted, is also capable of leading to mass defection of members to other parties in the state and urged the APC state and national leaderships to urgently intervene and salvage the situation. Addressing the gathering on behalf of the 193 APC ward chairmen, AbdulRasheed AbdulRauf, claimed that peace eluded the party since the inauguration of the APC government in the state in 2019. Also speaking on behalf of the 16 APC local government chairmen in the state, Engineer Muyideen Shittu, said the situation during the registration/revalidation exercise “should not be the attitude of a party that is desirous of winning future elections in the state.” Responding, the factional chairman, Hon Bashir Bolarinwa, assured the party members of transmitting their grievances to the appropriate quarter
