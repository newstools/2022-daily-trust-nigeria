Some youths from the six states of the South West yesterday converged on Lagos to ask Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to contest the 2023 presidential election. The youths, who insisted that it was Bello or no other person for president in 2023, vowed to rewrite what they described as “Nigeria’s political history of recycling old, tired politicians”. They also promised to chase away money bags with their money. They stated this during the launch of the Rescue Nigeria Mission (RENMIS) in the South West. The group canvassing support for Bello’s presidency had been earlier launched in some northern states, as the youths said they were ready to mobilise heavily for the governor no matter what happens within his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). The coordinator of the youths in the South-West, Shola Saheed, said “We are excited today that all our youths are keying in. As we speak today, over 20 million youths (PVC holders), at home and abroad, are already actively involved in the struggle to install our own Governor Yahaya Bello as president. Others are already trooping in. “We are set to rewrite the political history of Nigeria. We will not listen to ‘Baba sope’, we will collect their billions if they bring it, but we assure you, we will put Yahaya Bello there with our numbers. Don’t ask me how we will do it. Just watch and see how we would rescue this nation resolutely and peacefully. “This is the time for us the youths to change the status quo. If we don’t get it now, we might not get it again. I am calling on Nigerians to rise up and support a man that has the capacity to rule Nigeria.” The chief of staff to the governor, Abdulkareem Jamiu Asuku, who was invited to witness the declaration, thanked the youths for their unflinching support for his principal and promised that he would not let them down on the call on him to contest. He said Nigerian youths must be ready to end recycled presidency, saying there was the need for a change of status quo.
