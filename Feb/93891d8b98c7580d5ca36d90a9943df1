A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Acorn Initiative, at the weekend, gave out N396,000 for the registration for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for 22 selected female SS3 students. The Coordinator of the Acorn team, Mary Ikwue, made the donation to the girls who are students of Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS), Makurdi, on behalf of the organisation in a brief ceremony in the school. She said the gesture was the second edition of Acorn Initiative’s “Inbox Scholarship Programme” founded to assist and create opportunity for vulnerable people of different categories.
