Not less than 23 persons were arrested for engaging in smuggling activities in the South West between December 23, 2021, and January 30, 2022. Out of the 23 suspects, five of them have since been granted administrative bail while 18 others are still in the custody of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). Addressing newsmen yesterday in Lagos on the activities of the unit, the Controller of the Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A, Hussein Kehinde Ejibunu, said the suspects were arrested while trying to bring in different types of contraband. Mr Ejibunu said the unit had put in place new strategy to checkmate those he described as die-hard smugglers.
