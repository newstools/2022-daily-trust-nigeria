The Supreme Court has affirmed Murtala Karshi as the substantive chairmanship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) election taking place tomorrow. Karshi had approached the apex court challenging the judgment of the Appeal Court which earlier pronounced Suleiman Alhassan Gwagwa as the candidate of the APC in the polls. In a unanimous judgement Thursday, a five-member panel of the Supreme Court declared Karshi as the authentic flagbearer of the APC. In her lead judgment, Justice Helen Ogunwumiju, held that the Court of Appeal was wrong to have upturned the judgement of the trial court which affirmed Mr Karshi’ as the rightful candidate of the APC. In the judgement read by Centus Justice Nweze, the Supreme Court stated that “The 1st appellant (Mr Karshi) whose name was submitted by the 2nd appellant (APC) to the 2nd respondent (INEC) for the election of chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council remains the valid candidate for the election”. Consequently, the Supreme Court imposed a N5 million fine against Mr Gwagwa in favour of Mr Karshi and the APC. Karshi while speaking on the judgement, commended the Supreme Court for putting an end to the controversy surrounding his candidacy, saying that justice has finally prevailed in the area council.
