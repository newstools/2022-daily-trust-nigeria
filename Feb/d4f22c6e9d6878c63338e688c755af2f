The Kano State governor, Alh. Abdullahi Ganduje, has said the state government spent N2.5 billion on Dala Dry Port, Kano, so it can commence operations in good time. Alh. Ganduje spoke on Monday in Abuja during a courtesy call on the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi. He said the Dala Dry Port when operational will unlock the economic potential of Kano, neighbouring states, and even neighbouring countries like Niger, Chad and Cameroon. “The Kano State government put in N2.5 billion in infrastructure support to the Dala Dry Port as a corporate social responsibility. “We are providing access roads, and other social amenities to support the dry port and have it running. This is because that project was conceived about 20 years ago but it didn’t materialise until now. “I will make sure this project is a reality, hence we will have to provide an enabling environment,” he said. He also said he’s happy with the work done. “We are happy with the developers because they have gone far. “We are happy with the Minister of Transportation because he has given maximum cooperation to ensure that Dala Dry Port is a reality especially with the rail project coming from Lagos to Kano and up to Maradi. “This is making Kano the commercial nerve centre for the northern states and some West African countries,” he said. Commenting earlier, the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, pledged his support to the realisation of the dry port. He added that the biggest railway station in Nigeria will be built in Kano. “We appealed to the Kano State government to give us land where we will build the biggest rail station in Nigeria. It is the highest rail station because we are combining two rail stations. “The Kano-Maradi will empty in Kano and Kano-Kaduna, which will empty in Kano. The volume of passengers per week will be more than one million,” he said.
