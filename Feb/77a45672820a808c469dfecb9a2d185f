Some consumers of Hollandia Yoghurt in Kano and four other northern states have lauded the accessibility and quality of the brand, noting its appeal to their taste. The consumers who spoke in Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Sokoto and Borno, said their renewed affinity to the brand has been raised due to more awareness created by the brand in an ongoing campaign. According to a statement from the producers, CHI Limited, yesterday, Mallam Suleiman Hussaini, a company executive in Kano, said “As part of our tradition, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals as well as communities.” Also speaking, Bilkisu Musa, a teacher in Sokoto, said the media campaigns on the brand are a constant reminder of the brand and its wholesome nourishment benefit. In her comment on the campaign tagged, ‘Always Tradition, Always Hollandia Yoghurt’, the Marketing Director of CHI Limited, Mrs Toyin Nnodi, said the positive consumer feedback, especially in the North, was plausible.
