The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday appealed to the people of Pankshin/Kanam/Kanke Federal Constituency of Plateau State to re-elect Yusuf Gagdi, their representative in the House, come 2023 in view of his sterling legislative performance. Gbajabiamila made the call while addressing a delegation of the board and management staff of the defunct Federal College of Education Pankshin, which has now been converted to a Federal University of Technology Pankshin — after the President signed the establishment Bill into law on Wednesday. He said his admiration for Gagdi stemmed from his tenacity and the zeal to represent his people in the best possible way, as he strived daily to influence development to them through his legislative engagements in the House.
