The ruling party in Cross River State, the All Progressives Congress, has threatened to bar Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State from entering the state for political activities. This development comes shortly after the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party appointed Governors Nyesom Wike and Udom Emmanuel of Rivers and Akwa Ibom States to lead a 22-man campaign council for this weekend’s Ogoja/Yala federal and Akpabuyo state constituencies by-election in the state.

Debo Ologunagba. However, the Chairman of APC in the state, Alphonsus Ogar, who spoke to journalists at the APC headquarters in Calabar said the state will no longer condone Wike’s ‘constant meddlesomeness as the state is not an extension of Rivers State’. He said, “Nyesom Wike has been a constant meddlesome interloper and today we want to say that enough is enough. He was here on Saturday to incite violence in Cross River State but it took the maturity of our leader and governor, Professor Ben Ayade to avert violence. “What he has set to do overtime is to import the political cannibalism from Rivers State politics into Cross River State. We will no longer continue to allow him to cross the boundary of the line of political decency.”
