The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean of the United Kingdom (UK), Vicky Ford, is expected to pay a visit to Nigeria this week. During her visit, she is expected to unveil UK’s new investment interest in Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs) worth several millions of pounds. The visit, which will be her first to Nigeria, followed a UK-Nigeria Security and Defence Partnership Dialogue held in London earlier this month. Recall that at the meeting, both the UK and Nigeria agreed to strengthen cooperation in a range of areas, including military cooperation, counter-terrorism, civilian policing, protecting human rights and recognising the important role of women in achieving sustainable peace. A statement by the British High Commission in Abuja, a copy of which was made available to Daily Trust, revealed that while in Nigeria, Vicky Ford will have meetings with the Federal Government of Nigeria, state governors, as well as faith leaders, civil society and business leaders.
