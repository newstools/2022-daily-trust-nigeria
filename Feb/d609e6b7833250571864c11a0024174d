The newly elected Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Mr Christopher Zakka, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign into law the amendment electoral Bill before him Mr Zakka said the call became necessary to ensure a free, fair and credible general election in 2003. He made the call in Abuja while addressing newsmen on the just concluded FCT Area Council Elections. According to him, it will not be acceptable to conduct the next general election with the electoral law left behind by the past administration since 2015. He noted that the current generation of Nigerians, especially the youths, require an electoral law that can stand the test of time in the area of Information and Communication Technology, ICT. The AMAC Chairman-elect explained that electronic transmission of results which is included in the newly amended electoral Bill by the National Assembly would give credence to next year’s general election, hence the need for the president to give his assent to the Bill. “The manual collation of result in the past has resulted in rigging in so many ways. Therefore, the introduction of electronic transmission of results is a welcome development towards the emergence of credible leaders at all levels in the forthcoming general election,” he stressed. He, however, commended Buhari for ensuring a free, fair and credible chairmanship and councillorship election in the FCT. He also thanked residents of the Area for giving him the mandate to pilot the affairs of the council for the next three years. Mr Zakka said he would give priority to projects such as rural water supply, electricity, education, roads, health and other developmental programmes that will improve the wellbeing of the people of Abuja municipality. He solicited the support of the residents to enable him to succeed in his developmental programmes.
