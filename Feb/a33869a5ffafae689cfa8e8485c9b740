As part of their annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the students and teachers of Lufaloy Schools have donated items worth millions of naira to orphanages, IDP camps and the less privileged in Kano State. The chairperson of the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) of the Lufaloy, Halima Sani Gwarzo, said the activity was an annual exercise aimed at inculcating the habit of helping others and giving back to the society in the students. Halima said, “It is an initiative we’ve been doing since 1983; giving back to society, and to encourage the younger ones on helping those in need.” Responding, the social welfare officer of Nasarawa Children’s Home, Aisha Auwal Umar, and the principal of the secondary school in the IDP camp, Hassan Zaid Haruna, appreciated the gesture, while assuring to make judicious use of the items.
