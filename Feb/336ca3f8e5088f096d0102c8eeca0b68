A political associate of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Alhaji Muhammad Abdullahi Suga, has tackled Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed who said age was not on the side of the former No 2 citizen. The governor had on Sunday said Atiku, who is one of the presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is qualified but that age was not on his side. Reacting, Suga said Atiku is what Nigeria and Nigerians need to salvage the country from the verge of security and socio-economic collapse. “Is Bala saying that he is wiser than America that elected Trump at the 74 and Biden at 78 or Italy that re-elected President Sergio Mattarella at the age of 80? “As the situation demands, every Nigerian can agree with me that the failing state of the Nigerian economy needs an entrepreneur like Atiku to resuscitate it, next to him is Dangote but he’s not a politician. “Also, as a former customs officer, Atiku has the experience and capacity to protect our borders from the import of illegal arms and drugs that are currently aggravating conflicts in the country,” he said.
