Thirteen of the 15 Sokoto State House of Assembly members on Monday asked the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to recognise and swear in Alhaji Isa Achida, as the authentic state chairman of the party. In a position paper dated February 20, 2022, addressed to the chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, and made available to our correspondent Monday night, the lawmakers said they recognised a former governor of the state, Aliyu Wamakko as leader of the party in the state. Wamakko and Senator Gadda are at daggers drawn over the control of the party’s structure in the state. They had held a parallel state congress last year which produced two factional executives in the state. But the lawmakers who had a meeting with the top echelon of the party in Abuja said in their position paper that they were in full support of the Achida-led state executive which has been “fairly” running the affairs of the party in the state. The position paper was signed by Hon. Bello Isah Ambura, Addullahi Alhaji Zakari, Aminu Magaji Bodai, Muhammed Bello Idris, Abubakar Shehu Yabo, Faruku Amadu and others.
