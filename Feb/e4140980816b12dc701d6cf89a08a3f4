A presidential aspirant and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said it is an abuse of protocol to declare presidential aspiration in the Villa. Two presidential aspirants, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Governor Dave Umahi, had declared for the race after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Villa. In an interview in Abuja, Olawepo-Hashim said by declaring at the villa, the aspirants have put the president on the spot. “President Buhari is the president and commander in chief, he is not just the president of the APC, I believe it is an abuse of protocol to use that forum to make a declaration. “Have you ever seen any American contestant, or anywhere in the world where people go to the State House to declare? It has never been done. It is good to meet the president and consult with him and I will do that, but I believe that you don’t put him on the spot by choosing the seat of power to do such a thing; that is abuse of state protocol,” he said. The chieftain, who said he will declare his aspiration after the party’s convention slated for February 26, also said it was too early to declare for the presidency.
