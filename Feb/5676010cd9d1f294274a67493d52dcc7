Mercedes Benz said it is expanding its electric vehicle line-up with high-performance models of the EQE full-electric midsize Sedan under the Mercedes-AMG brand. This comes with two versions, the EQE 43 4MATIC with an output of 350 kilowatts (469 hp), and the 53 4MATIC+, with up to 505 kW (677 hp). Both models have dual electric motors, all-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering, along with other AMG performance and trim enhancements, Mercedes said in a news release on Wednesday. The EQE, in non-AMG form, will launch globally, starting in the middle of this year. Mercedes-Benz is taking a dual-pronged strategy to electrify the performance sub-brand – with plug-in hybrids and all-electric models – as the luxury automaker targets lower emissions. The EQE, like the larger EQS, is based on Mercedes’ EQA2 electric platform. Future AMG models will be based on the AMG.EA platform, and are likely to use high-performance axial flux electric motors. The interior of the Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC is with hyacinth red and AMG’s black nappa leather. The EQE will be the first of a number of new Mercedes EV nameplates planned as the automaker looks to undercut Tesla’s lead while challenging traditional rivals that are also rapidly electrifying. Crossover/SUV versions of the EQS and EQE are expected to be revealed shortly. Next-gen battery The EQE is powered by a next-generation (next-gen) battery that Mercedes claims is more energy-dense and faster charging. The battery can add 180 km (112 miles) of range in 15 minutes, the automaker said, adding that it is also greener, featuring new cell chemistry that reduces the cobalt content to 10 per cent.
