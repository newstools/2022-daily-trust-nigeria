The Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, has said that more investment in science and technology is the only way poverty can be stemmed in Africa. Prof Osinbajo, who spoke at the maiden “Young CEOs Summit” organised by the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) yesterday, said increased investment in science and technology to achieve sustainable socio-economic growth would reduce poverty and achieve food security on the continent. The vice president, who was represented by the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Amb Mariam Katagum, said, “As a nation, we must mobilise and widen the involvement of relevant segments of the population, including the private sector, civil society, parliamentarians and of course, Nigerians in the diaspora, to participate in the African Science and Technology Programme.” Osinbajo also said it was important to design an appropriate strategy to respond to the needs of transforming Africa into a knowledge-based and innovation-led society for a continental development. The President of ACCI, Dr Al-Mutaba Abubakar, said the summit was to attract young and dynamic members to secure the chamber’s future and to support youths-owned businesses, adding that the chamber would support young business owners through mentorship and capacity building. The Chairman of ACCI’s Young CEOs, Fife Banks, said the summit was a strategic initiative to engage widely with stakeholders across the public, private, development and diplomatic sectors to advance collective thinking on topical issues.
