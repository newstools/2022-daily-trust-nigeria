The Accident Investigation Bureau, Nigeria (AIB-N) has disclosed that 2,038 passengers have been killed in air crashes in 56 years. The AIB-N Commissioner/CEO, Engr Akin Olateru, disclosed this Sunday in Abuja at a press briefing to mark the International Day for the Commemoration of Air Crash Victims and their Families. February 20, every year has been designated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as “International Day for the Commemoration of Air Crash Victims and their Families”. Engr Olateru said, “In Nigeria, from 1969 to 2022, a total of 2,038 (1996 on board and 42 on the ground) lives have been lost to air crashes.” He said the casualty figure was relatively low compared to road crashes because air transport was the safest mode of transportation. He noted that the AIB was collaborating with other stakeholders like the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and airlines to improve air safety in Nigeria. Speaking at the event, the NCAA Director General (DG), Capt Musa Nuhu, said the safety of the Nigerian airspace had improved significantly in the last five years following improved implementation of safety recommendations from AIB-N.
