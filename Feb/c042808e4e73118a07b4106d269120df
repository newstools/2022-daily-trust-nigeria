Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State who is the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Congress Committee in Lagos has declared a former Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Tourism in the  State, Mr Philip Aivoji, as the newly elected Chairman of the party. Aivoji in a keenly contested election on Sunday defeated Dr. Amos Fawole with 839 votes to 816. The outcome of the election saw delegates jettisoning the consensus arrangement earlier adopted by the party which would have produced Fawole. Daily Trust had earlier reported how two Unity Lists emerged at the venue of the congress with delegates protesting that the race should be thrown open to enable them elect candidates of their choice. Announcing the results on Governor Diri said six candidates contested the Chairmanship including Aivoji, Fawole; Dr  Adetokunbo Pearse, King Okuneye; Niyi Adams and Dr. Abiodun Adebiyi. Okuneye scored 56 votes; Adams polled 29 votes while Pearse and Adebiyi scored zero votes each. Douye added: “I will like to use this opportunity to appreciate members of the PDP, Lagos State Chapter. The PDP is one and the same, this is a family election. I believe there is no winner, the winner is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Aivoji who is from Badagry Local Government expressed willingness to work with all the PDP leaders to change the fortunes of the party and prepare it for 2023 electoral victory. Other elected members included Benedict Tai (Deputy Chairman), Mr Soji Orioye (Secretary); Mrs Idowu Akinsanya (Women Leader); Mr Hakeem Amodu (Publicity Secretary), among others.
