The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has organised a sensitisation seminar for 60 exporters on the role of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in the growth and development of intra-African laws and treaties. The seminar, which was held at Royal Tropicana Hotel, Kano, had exporters and other stakeholders from the North West who were trained by experts in AfCFTA trading to equip them with required knowledge and skills for rapid development. Delivering his keynote address at the event, the Executive Director and CEO of NEPC, Dr Ezra Yakusak, said: “There is no gainsaying that Nigeria needs to diversify its economic base, hence the urgency needed to ensure that AfCFTA is fully embraced and understood by the exporting community. This also explains why the theme of this workshop was carefully chosen to deliberate, educate and equip our exporters to maximise the opportunities that AfCFTA brings to our dear nation.” He added that in a bid to make the instrument of Export Expansion Facility achieve the goal of the National Export Sustainability Plan (NESP), the council recently issued grants to deserving companies, and that it was expected the grants would help the exporters’ volume and value of their exports. The Kano State Commissioner for Commerce, Industry, Cooperative and Mineral Resources, Barr Ibrahim Mukhtar, appreciated the council for choosing Kano for the workshop, promising that state government was always willing for partnership on similar activities. The Coordinator (North West) of NEPC, Yakubu Gambo, charged the participants to utilise the knowledge gained from the training in their various businesses.
