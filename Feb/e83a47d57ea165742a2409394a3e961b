Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Monday, said nobody knows how Dr Iyorchia Ayu emerged as the National Chairman of Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). Ortom said this when he received Ayu’s kinsmen of Jemgba PDP Bloc at the Government House, Makurdi, the state capital. “Nobody understands how Ayu became PDP chairman. It was because he had prepared himself and you have prepared him. He is a round peg in a round hole. “You can see how he is performing; the Abuja councils poll is his signature. We are going to win all other elections to show that the APC is a failed government,” he said. The governor further thanked the political bloc for supporting him to win his elections twice in 2015 and 2019, adding that they have demonstrated their love for him just as he promised to do whatever they wanted for them. Earlier, Chairman of the Jemgba PDP Bloc, Barr Sam Tsumbe, appreciated the governor for all the good things he had been doing for their people including appointments. Tsumbe also thanked the governor for supporting Ayu to become national chairman of PDP and promised that they would reciprocate the gesture when the time comes for the governor to embark on any future political endeavours.
