The All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders in Akwa Ibom State have asked the secretary of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, to contest for the state governorship in 2023. This was contained in a communique issued to newsmen Thursday in Abuja, after the stakeholders’ meeting in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.

According to the communique, Atuekong Don Etiebet moved the motion for stakeholders to summon Senator Akpanudoedehe to join the governorship race and was seconded by Arch Bishop Samuel Akpan, a governorship candidate in 2015. The communique reads part: “After exhaustive deliberation, the motion was overwhelmingly passed with a notation for the resolution taken by a credible collection of Akwa Ibom APC stakeholders to be conveyed to the distinguished senator.” Meanwhile, Hon Uduak Sunday Etim, the convener, Akwa Ibom Progressive League (APL) has submitted a petition to the national leadership of the party.
