By Daniel Dada The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), has commenced the removal of tyres being used as barricade on all the streets within the city centre of Abuja, the nation’s capital. The Director of AEPB, Mr Osilama Braimah, revealed this in Abuja while speaking with newsmen on his plans towards repositioning the board for optimal performance. Mr Braimah, who expressed concern over the use of tyres as barricades on the streets, mostly by security personnel, said such action constituted an eyesore in the nation’s capital city hence the need to remove them completely. According to him, the exercise has been carried out in Apo, Central Area, Asokoro and Airport Road. The AEPB director, who said the exercise would be a daily activity, explained that necessary measures had been put in place by the board towards making Abuja a befitting capital city. He stressed the need for the use of standard signage and traffic codes when necessary as barricades instead of tyres. He noted that the board would align with the programmes of the Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, in creating a first class capital city comparable with any other one in the world. Mr Osilama further said the board would be repositioned for optimal performance while modalities would be strengthened for improved revenue generation through collection of waste management charges, enforcement of purchase of waste bins, discouraging of street hawking and shopping, strengthening of house to house inspection and effective enforcement of the noise pollution law. He added that plans were in top gear for the review of the AEPB Act to enable the board carry out its responsibilities in line with international best practices.
