The Kano State government has uncovered an unregistered private clinic that was also operating as a health training centre in the state metropolis. Alwasa’u clinic, located at Kurna Asabe in Fagge Local Government Area of the state, has been shut down after officials of the state government raided the place. It was gathered that the unregistered healthcare facility has been working illegally as a caregiver and training centre for auxiliary nurses, which is said to have been scrapped by the Nurses Council 20 years ago. Dr. Tijjani Usman Aliyu, Executive Secretary of the Kano State Private Health Institutions Management Agency (PHIMA) who made the announcement, said the agency raided the facility upon receiving information about its illegal activities. “When we raided the clinic, we discovered that the owner is a quack and was training auxiliary nurses, a programme cancelled over 20 years ago by the Nigerian Nurses Council. “During our investigation, the Nigerian Nursing Council and Nursing Professionals said there was no training called auxiliary nursing anymore as that has been suspended more than 20 years ago. “Presently, we are trying to find out how many students graduated from the illegal training centre and where they are working so that we can immediately stop the imminent danger they constitute,” he added.
