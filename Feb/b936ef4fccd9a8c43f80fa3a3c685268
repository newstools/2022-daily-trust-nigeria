The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Iyorchia Ayu, on Monday said despite the party’s victory in three area councils during last Saturday’s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) polls, they will challenge the result in three other areas where the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates were declared winners. Speaking during the commissioning of the Earnest Ikoli Media Complex in Yenagoa on Monday, as part of activities marking Governor Douye Diri’s second term in office, Ayu expressed delight that under his chairmanship, the party has recorded its first victory by winning Abuja Metropolitan, Kuje and Bwari council seats. He said the party is determined to challenge the results in Gwagwalada, Abaji and Kwali where APC candidates were declared winners. Ayu commended governors on the PDP platform for what he described as superlative performance in their respective states, which has given Nigerians confidence to bring PDP back to power at the centre in 2023.
