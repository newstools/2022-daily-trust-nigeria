The All Progressives Congress (APC) may shift its convention to March as a result of some pressing issues. The convention was scheduled for Saturday this week, but sources at the APC national secretariat confided in Daily Trust that there is a plan to shift it to March. This may be as a result of the crisis rocking the ruling party. Of late, APC has been affected by zoning and intra-party crisis in some state chapters. A new date for the convention would be announced as the party moves to constitute and inaugurate convention sub-committees this week. A credible source, who spoke with our correspondent, said, “It is possible because last Saturday we had by-elections and those who emerged are also statutory delegates, so extension is possible. “Now they are trying to constitute the convention sub-committees. They will put the committees in place this week. They have started working on that and by the end of this week they are likely to announce the sub-committees and people that will head the committees.”
