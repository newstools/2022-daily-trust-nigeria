Muslim women, under the aegis of Coalition of Nigerian Muslim Women, have converged at the Unity Park, Abuja, to create awareness on the significance of wearing hijab. The women, who represent different Islamic organisations also called on relevant government agencies to protect women wearing hijab from abuse and other forms of maltreatment and discrimination. This is the second in the series of outreach events to mark the 2022 World Hijab Day. Speaking at the event, Malama Azeeza Jibrin, a member of the coalition, said the hijab remains the dress of dignity and honour, so wearing it by the Muslim woman is an act of worship. She emphasised that Muslim women should be allowed to practice their faith as long as their religious practice does not in any go to the contrary. She noted that to create more enabling environments for the full enjoyment of the rights to freedom of religion, passing into law the Religious Discrimination Prohibition Prevention Bill 2021 must be treated with urgency by the relevant authorities. She encouraged every Muslim woman to persevere attacks and harassment and be confident wearing her hijab. “Today’s occasion will give us an opportunity to teach and invite the people of other faiths to adorn themselves with the hijab and experience a taste of the dress of honour,” she said.
