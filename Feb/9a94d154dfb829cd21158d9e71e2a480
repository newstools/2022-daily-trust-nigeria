The Chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee (TIC) of Offa Local Government Area in Kwara State, Jare Olatundun, has been arraigned before a magistrates’ court in Offa. Mr Olatundun was charged with failure to pay a N5m debt to an Offa-born contractor, Engr Agboworin Orimadegun. According to the charge before the court, Olatundun inherited the debt but disobeyed a court judgement that ordered that the council’s tractor be seized following failure to upset the debt. Counsel to the engineer, Barr Ibrahim Sharafadeen, approached the court with an application that Olatundun must be prosecuted for frustrating the court order. Barr B.L Ijaya, who represented the chairman, urged the court to dismiss the application on the basis that the council was a government parastatal and that Olatundun could not be solely prosecuted. The Magistrate, Abdullazeez Gamba, urged the two parties to adopt an amicable settlement and adjourned the case to February 14, 2022.
