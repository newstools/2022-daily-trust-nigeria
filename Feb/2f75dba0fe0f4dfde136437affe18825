A civil engineer, Nwali Godwin, on Thursday, approached an Igando customary court to dissolve his marriage with Nsika, alleging that she is ill-tempered, denies him sex, watches pornography and is into extra-marital affairs. He said, “My wife does not care about me. She’s irresponsible and she chats with various men on Facebook. I’ve also caught her watching pornography on her phone.” In her defence, the respondent, Nsika, denied all the allegations. She told the court that, “I am a responsible woman and wife. I take care of my home. I am not a nuisance as he alleges. I do not engage in extra-marital affairs. It is against our tradition in Akwa Ibom. “I am not ill-tempered. My husband is the violent one. I have been the one taking care of the feeding and paying of the children’s school fees.” Nsika, who refuted denying her husband sex, said, “When I gave birth, I had a vaginal tear and I was advised to stay away from sex for a while. “We were invited to the village to settle the case, but my husband refused to go. I am not against the union being dissolved. I am no longer interested in the marriage.” The president of the court, Mr Adeniyi Koledoye, adjourned the case to March 10. (NAN)
