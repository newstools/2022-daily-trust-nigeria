 From Yusufu Aminu Idegu, Jos A 22-year-old student of the University of Jos, Moses Okoh, was on Monday arraigned at a high court in Jos, Plateau State, for killing his 20-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer Anthony. The prosecutor, Insp Alex Muleng, told the court that Okoh killed Jennifer on December 31, 2021, and removed her eyes and other parts. Insp Muleng said the defendant lured the girlfriend to meet him for “cross-over night” to usher in the New Year, seized her phone and destroyed it, used his feet to smash her head on the floor and then gorged her eyes with a fork. The prosecutor added that Okoh fled the scene of the crime and was arrested on January 15, 2022, in Benue State. When the charge was read to Okoh, he remained mute. Earlier, Counsel to the defendant, N.E. Jesse, told the court that his client was suffering from mental problems and as such could not speak. The prosecutor, while objecting to the claim of insanity, stated that the claim was refutable as there was a medical certificate of sanity before the court which proved the accused to be of a sound mind. Insp Muleng added that the accused had been talking to the police, his family and his lawyer before the court proceedings, describing his action in court as “merely acting a drama”. Justice S.P. Gang entered a plea of not guilty for Okoh and adjourned the case to March 3 and March 4.
