Former National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Muiz Banire, has declared that the party will soon implode. Speaking in an interview on Lagos-based Radionow, Banire said the APC is known for violation of rule of law, and any organisation with disdain for rule of law, cannot stand the test of time. In the interview monitored by our correspondent, the former Commissioner for Justice in Lagos, said, “Certainly the APC will implode. The foundation of the party its self is weak. We have several people, tendencies coming together to acquire power but they are unable to synergise. Conflict is tearing the party apart.” He noted that the leadership architecture of the APC is largely in the hands of governors, saying this explains why the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee endorsed the faction controlled by state governors in all APC states. He recalled that he fought the party’s leadership as National Legal Adviser to follow the rule of law which they refused. Banire reiterated that he quit when his tenure expired having realszed he was keeping a “bad company.”
