Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a cross-section of Nigerian youths Thursday declared that they have begun moves to set up a citizen-based early warning response mechanism with a view to bringing calmness to the country during the process of electing a new crop of leaders. The youths, under the aegis of Grassroots Youth Coalition on Peace and Security (GYCPS), at a press briefing in Abuja, called on the federal government to domesticate the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 2250. Addressing newsmen, Secretary General and Convener of GYCPS, Umar Faruk Mohammed, explained that youths were key to the electioneering processes of the country, and the UNSC resolution has stated how the youths can be meaningfully engaged to achieve peace throughout the process. Mohammed said, “This global policy framework explores the devastating impact of armed conflicts on young people’s lives and what must be done to mitigate its effects, as well as how youth can be meaningfully engaged in managing conflicts, peace processes and creating peaceful communities.” He, however, urged the federal government to join hands in ensuring that citizen-based early warning response mechanisms are set up across the 774 local government areas in the country.
