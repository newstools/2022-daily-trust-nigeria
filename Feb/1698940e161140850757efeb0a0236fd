The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of six nominees as National Commissioners, and one other as Resident Electoral Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This is just as Senate President Ahmad Lawan said they expect that the electoral bill would be assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. The confirmation followed the consideration of a report by the committee on INEC chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano). President Muhammadu Buhari had, in a letter dated December 10, 2021, requested the Red Chamber to confirm the nominees. Buhari explained that the request was made pursuant to paragraph 14 of Part (1) of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution (as amended). The nominees confirmed are: Mal. Mohammed Haruna, National Commissioner (Niger, North Central); Mrs. May Agbamuche-Mbu (Delta, South-South); Ukeagu Kenneth Nnamdi (Abia, South East), and Major General A. B. Alkali (rtd) (Adamawa, North East). Others are Engr. (Prof.) Rhoda H. Gumus (Bayelsa, South-South), Mr. Sam Olumekan (Ondo, South West) and Olaniyi Olaleye Ijalaye (Ondo, South West). Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the parliament expects President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him on Monday for INEC to have an updated document to conduct off circle and general elections.
