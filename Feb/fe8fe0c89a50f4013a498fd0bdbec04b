The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) has unveiled its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Strategic Plan for the year 2022. The NIPC acting Executive Secretary, Emeka Ofor, who disclosed this at a forum in Abuja, said the agency would adopt an aggressive approach in encouraging both domestic and foreign investors to invest more in Nigeria’s economy. “One of the major things we consider the most in NIPC is the projection of Nigeria’s image to the world, and we take that assignment very seriously, because if a prospective investor feels good about your country and location, they will be thinking of investing there,” he said. Offor stated that apart from a series of stakeholders’ engagements lined up by the agency, it would partner with the media to improve the business environment through developmental reporting to attract more investments into the country. “We consider the press crucial to the work we are doing. That is why we want to change our quarterly engagement with the media to include showcasing Nigeria’s investment prospects more, hence attract investors, project a better image and support investments,” he explained. The NIPC chairman called for the need to balance stories with the positive real facts that projected Nigeria’s image in positive light so that when the world or stakeholders got information they would be able to have a balanced view of Nigeria.
