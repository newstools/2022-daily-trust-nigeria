The Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN) has revealed that based on the recent World Bank identification of logistics as the key metric for measuring national competitiveness, there is a need for Nigeria to improve its competitiveness through an effective logistic performance which will serve as a panacea for the nation’s economic growth. This was disclosed by CRFFN registrar and chief executive officer (CEO), Barrister Sam Nwakohu, during a three-day capacity building for North West freight forwarders on improving Nigeria’s competitiveness through logistic performance organised by CRFFN in collaboration with Amzik Integrated Nigeria Limited held in Kano. According to him, it is disheartening to note that countries that do not have waterways rank above Nigeria in terms of effective logistic management, hence the need to sensitise freight forwarders on measures to bridge the gap. Represented by the council’s director of education and training, Barrister Alban Igwe, the CEO explained that the council deemed it fit to educate freight forwarders on the new order to keep them abreast, as well as to keep the business afloat, in conformity with global best practices. Similarly, the managing consultant of Amzik Integrated, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Zik-Rullahi, emphasised that the training would equip freight forwarders with the necessary skills and technical know-how on their role and importance in the national economy, as well as make them understand international freight standard rules and procedures, that would enhance their operations under check and control. He urged the participants to ensure application of what they had learnt with a view to improving Nigeria’s competitiveness, as well as to ensure the nation’s growth. He called for improved budgetary provisions for the council to enable it extend the sensitisation and training to a wider range of participants in the country.
