ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) has launched a new campaign that will work towards encouraging women and youth participation and inclusion in the politics and governance of the country. The campaign, ‘WE-YOU PRO’, with a slogan Hope, Action and Progress for Women and Youths, is designed to ensure that women and youth benefitted from the Not Too Young To Run Act for youth to take the mantle of leadership at various positions. The parties that attended the launching of the project included youths and women from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Young Progressive Party (YPP), Africa Democratic Congress (ADC) and Social Democratic Party (SDP). Members of the civil society organisations and youth groups were also in attendance. Speaking at the event, which was held at Tahir Guest Palace in Kano, the Country Director of AAN, and Convener of Civil Society Situation Room, Ms Ene Obi, said the essence of the campaign was to sensitise women and youth to come together and work towards a prosperous future and rescue themselves from becoming marginalised. Also speaking, the representative of the emir of Kano, Fagacin Kano, Habibu Bello Dankadai, charged the youth to brace up and acquire leadership positions in the country to demonstrate their qualities and talents.
