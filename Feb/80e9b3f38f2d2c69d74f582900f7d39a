Barring last minute’s compromise, the aviation industry may be heading for a shutdown as unions in the sector have threatened to withdraw services with effect from midnight of February 8, The action is over the failure to release the negotiated Conditions of Service of the agencies since 2013. In the notice jointly signed by the unions’ secretaries-general, the unions are furious over the non-implementation of Minimum Wage and Consequential Adjustment since 2019 in all agencies. The agencies are the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Nigeria College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) and the Nigeria Meteorology Agency (NiMet). This was contained in the notice jointly signed by four unions comprising the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) and the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE). Daily Trust reports that the unions had earlier given an ultimatum of 31st January but a meeting was called with it and the Ministry of Aviation officials which did not yield results. But Dr James Odaudu, Director of Public Affairs in the ministry said the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, would intervene to stall the proposed strike. “I can assure you that the ministry will intervene. We will not fold our hands. The minister is somebody who has never joked with staff welfare,” he said. According to the unions, they are “left with no choice than to take the next obvious step. In this regard, all aviation workers are hereby directed to commence total withdrawal of services from midnight of Tuesday 8th of Feb, 2022 unless, and until, otherwise directed in this same manner.”
