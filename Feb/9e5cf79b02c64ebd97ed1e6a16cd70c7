The Campaign for Democracy (CD) has added its voice to the debate over zoning, insisting that power must shift to the South for the sake of equity, justice and fair play. The CD said it was pitching its tent with the southern governors for their commitment to shifting power to southern Nigeria. It would be recalled that the forum, through its chairman, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, had stated that any political party that refused to field a southerner as its presidential candidate would lose election. In a communiqué issued at the end of its meeting in Lagos, CD stated that those opposing rotation are tinkering with the corporate existence of the country. “Only a party that is determined to lose will field a northern candidate,” CD said. The communiqué, signed by its General Secretary, Pastor Ifeanyi Odili, said no ethnic bloc must continue to dominate over other ethnic nationalities.
