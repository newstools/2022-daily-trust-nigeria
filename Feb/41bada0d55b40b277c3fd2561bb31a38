The Katsina State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been commended for giving youths prominence in the forth coming local government elections scheduled for April, 2022. Prince Muhammed Kadade Suleiman, PDP, National Youth Leader gave the commendation in a statement in Abuja. Sulieman said, under the able Chairmanship of Hon. Salisu Yusuf Majigiri and all leaders of the Party in the State; the PDP has clearly shown its commitment and belief in the youth to deliver. He said “It is quite unprecedented that, out of 361 wards, 259 Candidates for Councilorship are young people taking about 72% of the available elective positions. It is even more impressive when you take cognizance of the fact that 60% of these candidates are aged between 25 and 30 years.” Sulieman commended the PDP Acting Zonal Youth Leader (North-West), Hon. Hamza Jibia for his unalloyed display of leadership and direction for the youth. The youth leader said “It is important to state that there is now a clear agenda and direction for the youth in the party. We have taken it upon ourselves to convince the leadership of the party on the importance of supporting the Youth to contest Local Government and Councilorship elections. “As National Youth Leader, we won’t relent in our efforts at championing the cause of the youth until the PDP takes its place as the most veritable platform for young people to realize their political ambitions and effect change in their respective societies,” saying while it may be easier to only talk and make posts on Social Media, “I always reiterate that the grassroots is the backbone of politics. “Our political orientation recognizes Local Governments as the first and focal point of political contact. Therefore, the vibrancy, energy and vigor of the youth to impact the lives of their people is a welcome addition to the political space.”
