The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) is set to install 180,000 meters under the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) for customers who pay for them. The Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of AEDC, Engr Oluwafemi Zacchaeus, who disclosed this at a sensitisation session in Abuja on Wednesday, said of the 180,000 meters to be deployed, 135,000 units were single-phase, while 45,000 units were three-phase meters. He said six vendors had been shortlisted for the MAP scheme, noting that AEDC was ready for massive installations as customers pay for them. He said, “Within one week, once the payment is made, you will have the meter. Already we have 50,000 meters in our stores ready for installation. So, meters are available.” The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Me Donald Etim, said customers who paid and got the MAP meters will have a refund. He said, “The MAP Metering programme gives customers the option of paying for a meter while the money is refunded to them through the issuance of energy credit over a period of 36 months.” He added that the regulated price for a single-phase meter was N63,061.32, while a three-phase meter went for N117,910.69. Meanwhile the company also launched its website vending platform to provide an alternative of vending for meters instead of using third party vendors. Etim said, “AEDC’s bid to enhance customers’ experience has received a boost with the development of a platform that allows electricity customers to buy energy directly from the company’s website rather than go through a third party.”
