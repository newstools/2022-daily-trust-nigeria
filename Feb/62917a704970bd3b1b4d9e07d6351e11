In a bid to conform with the new Disability Act, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has appointed a visually impaired, Bature Abubakar, as his technical assistant. The appointment, according to a statement by the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD), was sequel to an appeal to the minister to provide opportunities for Persons With Disabilities in the ministry. The Executive Secretary of NCPWD, James David Lalu, during a gathering to celebrate the feat attained by a member of the disability community, noted that the gesture would go a long way in proving that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration meant well for PWDs. While congratulating Abubakar on his appointment, Mr Lalu advised him to see himself as an ambassador of PWDs while discharging his duties. He said, “Your success is indeed our success, and this is significantly enhanced in sharing this triumphant moment with you. It is hoped that you will display the highest sense of professionalism, dedication, patriotism and integrity in the conduct of this important assignment.” Responding, Abubakar, while appreciating the FCT minister, thanked the executive secretary for being a pillar of goodwill. Abubakar pledged commitment and willingness to be efficient and a worthy ambassador of persons with disabilities while serving in his new capacity.
