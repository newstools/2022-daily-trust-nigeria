Recall that December’s figure was a rise from an eight-month decline of the nation’s Consumer Price Index (CPI). Experts attributed the rise to the December festivities which fuelled more consumer spending. The Statistician-General of the Federation/Chief Executive Officer, National Bureau of Statistics, Dr Simon Harry, in a press briefing on Tuesday, stated that the new figure was influenced by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food products like potatoes, yam and other tubers, soft drinks, oils and fats, and fruits. He added that on a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 1.62 per cent in January 2022, which was down by 0.57 per cent points from 2.19 per cent recorded in December 2021.
