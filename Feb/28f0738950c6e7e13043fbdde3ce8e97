A group rooting for the presidential bid of national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said the heavyweight politician will not leave the ruling party because of presidential ticket. Addressing a press conference on Monday in Abuja, the Convener and National Co-ordinator of Youth for Tinubu Initiative (YTI), Ajibola Afolayan, said Tinubu would campaign vigorously and get the APC’s presidential ticket. He said no shenanigan of any form would stop Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State from getting the party’s ticket, adding that his aspiration is in the interest of Nigerians. Meanwhile, hundreds of young professionals from the northern part of the country converged on Kano to join the train for the actualization of the presidential aspiration of Tinubu. Daily Trust reports that Tinubu enjoys strong support in Kano following several visits embarked upon by the APC leader to the state in the last few months leading to several groups springing up in the state to help actualize his presidential ambition. The new group, called Northern Young Professional For Tinubu (NYPT), is led by its national co-ordinator, Alhaji Abdullahi Tanko Yakasai, one of the sons of elder statesman and a founding father of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Tanko Yakasai, who has also endorsed the presidential ambition of the former Lagos state governor. The younger Yakasai, while launching the movement and its office in Kano yesterday, said it was not envisaged out of selfish interest but to bring together young professionals who have a stake not only to determine the future of Nigeria but also their own. On his part, Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, who was represented by the Managing Director of Kano State Road Transport Agency (KAROTA), Alhaji Baffa Babba Dan’agundi, said the emergence of Tinubu in 2023 as president will provide answers to the myriad of problems bedevilling the country.
