With the issue of zoning still in contention, the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday failed to commence the sale of expression of interest and nomination forms for the National Working Committee (NWC) offices ahead of the February 26, 2022, national convention. Daily Trust had reported that the party’s schedule of activities for the convention released earlier, showed that the sale of forms would commence yesterday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, while submission of completed forms and accompanying documents would be on or before February 19. But findings by our correspondent who visited the APC national secretariat in Abuja, on Monday, showed that aspirants for various offices did not turn out for the purchase of forms as the zoning formula was not yet announced. Controversy is raging in the ruling party over which zone produces President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor at the expiration of his tenure in 2023. It is believed that if the party zones its 2023 presidential ticket to the South, the North would have the chairmanship slot and vice versa. Meanwhile, youths of the APC have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reject plans by some states governors of the party to hijack proceedings at the forthcoming national convention slated for Feb 26, this year. The youths under the aegis of APC Youth Development and Solidarity Forum, at rally on Monday in Abuja, expressed worry that governors in the party were orchestrating the move so as to singlehandedly pick the chairman and other positions in the party.
