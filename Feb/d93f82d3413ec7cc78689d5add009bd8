Despite receiving the third jab, 73-year-old Prince of Wales, Charles Philip Arthur George, has gone into isolation after being tested positive for COVID-19 for the second time. Clarence House said the prince was found to be positive during a routine test, but further details with regards to health condition were not given by the officials. Prince of Wales contracted the disease sometime in March 2020. A post by the prince’s official Twitter handle said, “This morning The Prince of Wales has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now self-isolating. “HRH is deeply disappointed not to be able to attend today’s events in Winchester and will look to reschedule his visit as soon as possible.” The prince and the Duchess of Cornwall have been taking regular tests before engagements, but Camilla had tested negative on Thursday. The development was coming at the heel of Boris Johnson’s plans to lift coronavirus restrictions in England by the end of the month. If the new policy is implemented, even those who have tested positive for the virus will not be required to self-isolate.
