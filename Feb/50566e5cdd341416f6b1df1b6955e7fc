The Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (NIEEE) has called for a partnership with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to rehabilitate youths convicted for cyber fraud. The Chairman of NIEEE, Engr Akan Michael, stated that cyber fraudsters, locally called “Yahoo Boys”, were assets to attract foreign investments into the country when their digital skills were properly harnessed. While noting that the arrest and conviction of cyber fraudsters would not solve the menace, he said youths often resorted to crime as there were no available jobs for them in the country. Speaking at his investiture as Chairman of NIEEE on Saturday in Abuja, Engr Michael said, “So we intend to partner with EFCC to train young people either by way of rehabilitation or in a proactive manner to let them know that the skills that they have could be used for the good of the nation.” EFCC’s director of ICT, Bello Muhammad, who represented the chairman of the commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, called on youths to channel their skills into activities that would increase the economic potentials of the country.
