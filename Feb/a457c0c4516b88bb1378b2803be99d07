The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged massive rigging and other malpractices in last Saturday’s by-election for the Ngor Okpala state constituency election in Imo State. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had announced the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Blyden Amajirionwu, as the winner of the election. But the PDP in a statement by its state Chairman, Engr Charles Ugwu, alleged that the APC “covertly perfected an evil plot to prevent the people from exercising their constitutional mandate” and called for cancellation of the poll. The party said, “Armed groups operated freely, maiming, and shooting sporadically. They abducted staff of INEC and agents of the PDP, carted away electoral materials and result sheets.” The APC could not be reached for response as at the time of filing this report. However, a candidate of the APC in last Saturday’s House of Representatives by-election for Akure South/Akure North Federal Constituency of Ondo State, Mr Mayokun Lawson- Alade, has been declared winner of the poll. The returning officer for the election, Professor Deji Ogunsemi of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), announced the result on behalf of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He said the APC polled 26,379 to beat six other contestants in the election. Mayokun Lawson -Alade of the APC would now replace Adedayo Omolafe whose death in August last year created a vacuum at the House of Representatives. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared a candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Musa Aga Avia, winner of the Jos North/Bassa by-election. Daily Trust reports that the election was conducted following the death of late Haruna Maitala, who died on April 3, 2021, in a motor accident along Abuja-Jos road.
