The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit has demolished shanties in more than areas of the state. The officials of the unit said the move was to allow for free flow of traffic, discourage haphazard development and promote a crime-free society. Areas cleared are along Lekki-Marwa Coastal Road, Sapphire Tower and Blue Water Area along Lekki-Epe Expressway. The Chairman of the task force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, who led the demolition team, said the state was no longer home for miscreants and haphazard development or shanties, but could only accommodate people with positive thinking.
