Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ayedaade, Irewole and Isokan Federal Constituency yesterday turned out in large number for Alhaji Moshood Adeoti ahead of Saturday’s primary of the party. The party faithful converge on Ikire, headquarters of Irewole Local Government Area where the Minister of Interior Mr Rauf Aregbesola addressed them and urged them to vote for Adeoti to be the candidate of the party for the July 16 governorship election. Addressing the party members, Aregbesola noted that it is time to reject the incumbent, Gboyega Oyetola and support Adeoti to be the next governor of Osun State. . Aregbesola said it is time to restore Osun to the hands of true progressives which the party members must key into to entrench the dividends of democracy. He said “There is no harm in replacing someone who is not doing well and not in tandem with progressive ideals. That is what we are working on. “I worked very hard to ensure Oyetola’s election. It was however a rude shock when he got into office and started a grand witch-hunt against me. We campaigned for Oyetola through thick and thin to make him Governor. It was however surprising to see how he was doing to me when he got to office.”
