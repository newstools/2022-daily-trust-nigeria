A group, South East Patriots, (SEP) has called on Nigerians to concede the presidency to the South East or North East zones in the forthcoming general elections in 2023. The group equally called on the leaders from the two zones to, as a matter of urgency, begin discussions and negotiations on how they’ll take shots at the presidency and who does the same now. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja, the convener of the group, Sir Obunike Ohaegbu, said the group was committed to ensuring the emergence of the president of Nigeria from the Southeast or North-east extraction in 2023 as nobody from the Northeast has led Nigeria since 1970. He said, “Consequently, the SEP has put together a high powered committee that will walk to other critical stakeholders and leaders in Nigeria to encourage a more practical realization of a president of Nigeria of Southeast extraction as soon as possible. “In keeping with our set objectives, we’ve come to the conclusion that for the zone to produce a president of southeast extraction, there’s the urgent need for our people to initiate conversations with critical stakeholders and leaders from all parts of the country to achieve our goals in a more practicable time and season,’’ he added.
