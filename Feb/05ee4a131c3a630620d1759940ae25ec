Governor of Rivers State Nyesom Wike has said he attended the trial of a former governor of Plateau State, Jonah Jang, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to show his solidarity to him. Jang, a Board of Trustees (BoT) member of the Peoples of Democratic Party (PDP), is being tried by the EFCC over alleged financial crime. He was in court in Jos, the Plateau State capital, yesterday. Speaking after attending the trial, Wike said, “I am in Jos to meet with PDP leaders and stakeholders in the state. And it is an opportunity for me to also show solidarity with a BoT member of PDP who is standing trial in this court. “So I’m in the court to show solidarity with Jang, to assure him that he is not alone in this trial. To tell him that this is one of the challenges facing former governors under this administration and to assure him he will be victorious at the end of it all.” Meanwhile, the National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has stated that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has deprived the country of development and enthroned incompetence and corruption. Ayu made the assertion when he led members of the National Working Committee and other top leaders of the party to a crucial meeting with General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd) in Minna, Niger State. He said the visit was in furtherance of PDP’s efforts to rescue and rebuild the nation from the misrule of the APC in the last six years. By Yusufu Aminu Idegu (Jos) & Baba Martins (Abuja)
