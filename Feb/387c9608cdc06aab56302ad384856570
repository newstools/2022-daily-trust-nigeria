A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has blasted the two leading political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said they have nothing to show Nigerians and get re-elected in the coming 2023 elections. Kwankwaso, who is a leader in the PDP, stated this while featuring in a programme on a local radio, Nasara FM, in Kano on Saturday. He said the two parties are made up of envious people, adding that instead of voting them again, Nigerians should look for a party that can rescue them collectively. “I didn’t see anything that either APC or PDP will show or tell Nigerians to get convinced and to vote for them in the coming 2023 elections. “So, I think people should now come to think of the right party and people to support and vote for so that we can rescue them from the present situation,” he said. The former Senator and presidential aspirant in the 2019 presidential election said coming back to the state political level wasn’t a good decision, but the need to rescue Kano made him take such action. “In 2015 we gave the leadership of the state to some [people] thinking that they will make it, but not knowing that it won’t yield any positive outcome. That is why we are back to rescue our state.” Kwankwaso has been linked with moves to leave the PDP for another party in recent times, giving the feud between him and some top leaders in the Kano PDP.
