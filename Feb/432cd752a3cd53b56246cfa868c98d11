A political ally of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, Abubakar Mu’azu Hassan, has said he is contesting for Gombe Central Senatorial District seat “because people of the zone are tired of recycling old politicians.” Habu Mu’azu, as he is popularly called, had declared to contest for the seat, currently being occupied by Senator Danjuma Goje, an erstwhile godfather to him and the incumbent governor. The former youth leader of the PDP during Goje’s administration became a confidant and ally of Yahaya after the governor fell out with Goje. The national leadership of the APC had in January attempted to reconcile Goje and Yahaya. Mu’azu told Daily Trust that he is in the race because Goje had in the past stated that he will not contest for the seat again, “and is yet to formally declare his interest again, which means he is not interested to contest at least under the APC.”
