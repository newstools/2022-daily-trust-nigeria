The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will improve the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) in the forthcoming by-elections and off-season governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states before the 2023 general elections. INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this, on Tuesday in Abuja, at the first meeting of the year with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs). He said the commission would ensure some of the challenges are tackled ahead of future elections, including the review election day administration. Last Saturday’s FCT area council elections were marred by dysfunctional BVAS; late arrival of staff/materials and unawareness of the newly created Polling Units (PUs) which led to the disenfranchisement of some voters. The INEC boss acknowledged the challenges to the optimal functionality of the BVAS in the FCT council election and previous polls and assured that the commission is working on them. He also said INEC has devolved the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to the ward level in both Ekiti and Osun states to enable more citizens to register ahead of the June and July governorship elections in the states. He added that the commission is considering the devolution of the exercise nationwide beyond its state and local government offices where the registration currently takes place to other designated centres, saying it was one of the major issues for discussion at the meeting with RECs.
