A Benin-based Pediatrician, Dr Kelvin Ogbebor, has advised mothers who want to wean their babies to do so gradually as they reduce breastfeeding each day over weeks or months to prevent mastitis. Ogbebor, who gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin on Monday, said mastitis usually occurs when women do not wean their babies properly. He defined mastitis as an infection of the tissue of the breast that occurs during breastfeeding. He added that “it can occur when bacteria, often from the baby’s mouth, enters a milk duct through a crack in the nipple.
