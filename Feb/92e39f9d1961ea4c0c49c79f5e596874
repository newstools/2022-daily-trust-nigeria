The Zamfara State High Court 7 has adjourned to March 14, 2022 the suit filed by Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, challenging the legality of the All Progressives Congress (APC) state congress organised by the Governor Bello Matawalle-led faction of the party in the state. Justice Bello Kucheri adjourned the case to March 14, 2022, for hearing which was agreed by counsel of both factions. Addressing newsmen in the court premises after the sitting, the lead counsel to Senator Marafa-led faction, Barrister John Shaka, said they were asking the court to nullify all the congresses conducted by the Governor Matawalle-led faction of the party, describing them as illegal. “Senator Kabiru Marafa is a chieftain of the party and has the constitutional right to challenge the illegality of the congresses conducted by Governor Matawalle’s faction,” he said. Barrister Shaka said they were praying the court to cancel the congresses and order for fresh congresses from ward to state level in the state. In his speech, the lead counsel to Matawalle faction, Barrister Shiaka M. Dikko, said the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case because Senator Kabiru Marafa had allegedly ceased to be a member of the APC. He also said the court will begin hearing in the case on March 14, 2022, adding that it would be a legal battle.
