Ibom Air, a commercial airline owned by Akwa Ibom State government, has commenced commercial flight operations at the newly commissioned Bayelsa State International Airport in Yenagoa, the state capital. With the commencement of flight operations at the airport, Ibom Air has increased the number of commercial airlines at the airport to two, since United Nigeria Airline (UNA) started operations upon the opening of the airport last September. The inaugural flight by Ibom Air, which touched down at the airport around 4pm on Tuesday, will complement the other carrier, United Nigeria Airline, which had earlier started operations. Speaking during the inaugural landing of Ibom Air, Bayelsa State Governor Douye, commended the airline for its services that have ensured the airline’s rapid growth within a short period. He observed that the story of the South South region was changing from that of deprivation and underdevelopment to a developed region and called on governors of the region to forge closer ties in order to better the lot of the people. Earlier, the Chief Operating Officer, Ibom Air, George Uriesi, said it is a new vista in the relationship between Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom and promised that they would continue to deliver the top class services the airline is known for.
