Members of one of the oil consortia that was said to have imported the high specification Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) recently have appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream). The consortium has four oil companies: Emadeb Energy, Hyde Energy, A.Y Maikifi and Brittania-U. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Emadeb Energy, Adebowale Olujimi, in a presentation, said the consortium had a Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP) agreement with the NNPC Ltd since June, 2021. Mr Olujimi said Brittania-U preferred to deal directly with NNPC Ltd and took responsibility for all its transactions without recourse to the other consortium members. However, during her presentation, the CEO of Brittania-U, Uju Ifejika, said the fuel they imported was subjected to all the necessary tests and certified by inspectors, including those of the NNPC. She accused NNPC of concealing what really transpired regarding the quality specification tests and certification of the PMS imported by the company. Reacting, the Chairman of the house committee, Hon Ahmed Abdullahi Gaya (APC, Kano), said, “We have already informed them that after going through the documents, we are going to invite them again to come so that if we have any other thing to verify, they will have to tell us. For now, it is just to explain and give us the documents.”
