At least 19 states are at various stages of implementing universal health coverage through the establishment of their respective health insurance schemes to bridge access to health insurance. Research by the World Bank and the World Health Organisation (WHO) show that 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty on an annual basis due to healthcare expenses. While health insurance has been operational in Nigeria for over 15 years, the uptake has remained low. Speaking at a virtual Leadway Assurance media training, the Head, Medical Services, Leadway Health, Dr. Temitope Falaiye, stated that Nigeria spends a relatively small proportion of national income, translating to about 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health against the agreed 15 per cent at the 2001 Abuja Declaration. He said out-of-pocket expenditure on health is amongst the highest in the world at 77.23% of total health expenditure and the highest in Africa. “To bridge the coverage gap, several states have commenced the establishment of State Health Insurance Schemes. Presently, about 19 states are at various stages of their implementation journey. Anambra, Delta and Lagos states have particularly made significant progress in enrolment. Private Health insurance accounts for less than 3% of the Nigerian population,” he said.
