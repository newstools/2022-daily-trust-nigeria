People’s Democratic Party (PDP) statutory delegates in Akwa Ibom State, comprising select ward and chapter officers, have defied the state government with their public endorsement of Mr Onofiok Luke for the 2023 governorship election. Luke is the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Judiciary. Ever since Governor Emmanuel announced the Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Pastor Umo Eno, as his preferred successor, some displeased party members have declared their support, though secretly, for other gubernatorial aspirants. The delegates and other party members, numbering more than 250, publicly endorsed Luke, a former Speaker of the State House of Assembly. Spokesman for the group, Mr Abraham Udoekong, said they resolved to support  Onofiok Luke irrespective of the antics of the state government to “unprecedentedly” endorse one aspirant. Speaking on Thursday in Uyo, Udoekong  said Luke has the capacity, character, love for the people, ideas and passion to drive economic and social development of the State. He stated that they gave themselves a mandate to scout for and mobilise committed delegates for Luke, as such, the public endorsement. “We are taking this bold step for the general good of our state. We started  mobilising ourselves for the Onofiok Luke’s governorship project in 2023; today we have mobilised delegates to come here and endorse Onofiok Luke. We believe in him, we will vote for him,” he said. Udoekong said they were not disturbed by recent political happenings in the state, noting  that their resolution to support Onofiok Luke at the party primary was absolute.
