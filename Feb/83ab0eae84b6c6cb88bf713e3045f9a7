The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) says it had uncovered 6,000 uncompleted buildings across the territory. This followed intensified efforts by the authority to curb the rising cases of uncompleted buildings in the city centre and the territory. The Director, Department of Development Control of FCTA, Alhaji Muktar Galadima, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Sunday, in Abuja. Galadima, a town planner, explained that the administration, in conjunction with other relevant departments had sent letters to the owners of all the uncompleted buildings. This was for them to complete their structures and put them into their designated use and based on the original master plan. He also revealed that his department held an interactive session with the owners of the uncompleted buildings and educated them on the consequences of having uncompleted structures all over the city and territory. He said “some of them had responded favourably and the department conducted integrity tests on some of the structures, while some others had made effort to complete their structures. “This is how far we have gone. As regards the issue of uncompleted buildings, with all sense of modesty, I can speak authoritatively about it. “I know that we have over 6,000 uncompleted buildings in Abuja and the Federal Capital Territory Administration is making effort to stem the tide of rising cases of uncompleted buildings in the territory.” On the issue of unoccupied houses, Galadima, said, “Unoccupied buildings have consequences on the development of the city.” (NAN)
