The hardship experienced by motorists in Abuja due to the scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) popularly known as petrol for about two weeks is gradually easing off. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the queues in most filling stations on the Kubwa Expressway have reduced. NAN correspondent, who went round, discovered that some retail outlets in Maitama, Wuse, Gwarimpa, and Wuye districts had relatively short queues. Other fuel stations were, however, not open. A taxi driver, Hassan Aliyu, told NAN that he had been in queue at the filling station for about 30 minutes but was yet to buy the product. Aliyu said, “I’m happy that the situation is gradually easing off and getting better compared to last week.” A private car owner, Emmy Chinedu, expressed dismay that the adulterated fuel which was imported had damaged many vehicles. Chinedu suggested that the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) should help get justice for the poor, noting that, “The marketers cannot be bigger than the government.” Mrs Angela Iwe, also a car owner, commended the government for its effort aimed at arresting the situation. She said, “As a result of the fuel crisis, the prices of foodstuff have increased. I pray they reduce, especially now that things are getting back to normal.”
