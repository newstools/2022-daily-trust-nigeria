The National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) has raised the alarm over the continuing deterioration of security within Shiroro and its environs in Niger State. The union in a press release signed by its general secretary, Joe Ajaero, said it is deeply disturbed about the safety of not only the locals inhabiting the area but its members that are residing in the neighbouring communities. According to NUEE from the reports it gathered, the insecurity around Shiroro might have been worsened with the recent havoc and killings that occurred at Galadima-Kogo, which is a neighbouring village to Shiroro. The statement said: “With the deepening security concerns, it is becoming more difficult to vouch for the safety of lives and properties especially with pockets of cases of electricity workers’ abduction in some parts of the country. “And with the level of destruction of properties and the proximity to Shiroro where we have great national power assets, we are calling on the federal government to be proactive in providing immediate security for the protection of these national assets and electricity workers to and from their duty posts,’’ it added. However, the union warned that if the government fails to provide the needed security, the union will have no option other than to call off its members in Shiroro and environs until the security situation is improved and the safety of its staff is guaranteed.
