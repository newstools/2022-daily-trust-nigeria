The Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria (AIB-N) has released the report of the Quorum Aviation helicopter that crashed in Opebi Lagos in 2020 with three fatalities. Quorum helicopter crash is the only fatal accident in the country in the last five years. The accident involving the Bell 206B3 Helicopter with registration 5N-BQW occurred at Opebi, Ikeja, Lagos State, on August 28, 2020. Addressing the media on Thursday, the AIB-N Commissioner, Engr Akin Olateru, disclosed that, “The causal factor of the accident was due to fuel exhaustion at low altitude and low speed leading to loss of control in flight.” He added that, “The pilot’s decision to continue the flight towards the intended destination with insufficient fuel instead of landing as soon as practicable in line with section 12.12 of Quorum Aviation Limited Operations Manual Part A, was part of the contributing factor that led to the fatal accident.” Another contributory factor said the Commissioner, “was the lack of effective management supervision of the airline’s flight operations and inadequate safety oversight of Quorum Aviation Limited.” The bureau also released the report on the serious incident involving Nigeria Police Airwing Bell 429 Helicopter with registration 5N-MDA which occurred at Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja, on August 3, 2019. Also released was the report on the serious incident involving Skypower Express Airways Nigeria Limited Cessna 172 Aircraft with registration 5N-APE at Bini Village, Niger State, on November 19, 2019.
