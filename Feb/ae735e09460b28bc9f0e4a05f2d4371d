President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to sign the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill on Friday, reliable sources in the presidency confirmed Wednesday. Sources close to the office of the President said arrangements had been finalised for the president to sign the amendment bill into law around 12pm. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “All these anxieties will disappear by Friday afternoon. “He will be signing the bill around noon of that day. “I believe he has taken his time so that the act can be as unassailable as much as possible.” Civil society organisations (CSOs) had organised protests over President Buhari’s delay in assenting to the re-amended bill. The National Assembly transmitted the bill to President Buhari on January 31, a second time, after reworking the draft law rejected by the president. Meanwhile, the founder of Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, has urged Buhari to assent to the electoral bill. Peterside, who is also the founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, on Wednesday in a tweet backed a coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs), who took to Unity Fountain in Abuja on Tuesday to protest the President’s delay in assenting to the bill.
