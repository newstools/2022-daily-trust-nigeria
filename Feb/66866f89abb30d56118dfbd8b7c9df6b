The campaign organization of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Hon. Bisi Kolawole, has said the state will be made secure while the welfare of the people and infrastructural development will be prioritized if the party returned to power in October this year. While noting that the governorship election campaign will be issue-based, the campaign spokesman, Lere Olayinka, said in a statement in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, that PDP will be reminding Ekiti people of the number of workers employed during its governments. He urged APC to be honest enough to also tell the people how many workers its governments sacked. “As we move into the campaign for the governorship election, our party and its candidate will no doubt be reminding Ekiti people how safe the state was four years ago. “We will be juxtaposing how secured Ekiti was during the immediate past PDP government, such that the state was adjudged the safest in the South West with the Ekiti of today,” he stated.
