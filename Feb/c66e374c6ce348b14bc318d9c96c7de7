The recent declaration of a strike by the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) has crippled business activities on the University of Jos campuses. ASUU had on February 14, 2022, declared a one-month total and comprehensive strike action to force the government to address their problems. However, almost all business owners within and outside the Main and Permanent site campuses of the institution have lamented how the strike action has affected their business. Our correspondent who visited the main campus reports that business owners were seen sitting without patronage from customers who are mostly students and lecturers. Jennifer Augustine, who sells water and other types of soft drinks at the Main Campus, said the action by the lecturers had indeed affected her business, saying the situation was bad. She said: “Prior to the strike action, we made lots of sales. In fact, we always sell all the drinks we bring here when students are available. But today, we are just managing but the students are no longer available. Our sales have dropped drastically. We are begging the government to fulfil the promises it had made to the lecturers”. John David, who owns a computer centre on the campus also complained about the development. “You can see the situation is not favourable at all. The shop is empty because the students have been sent home. If there is any way government can help the situation, we will be very happy. “We are calling on the government to be serious about the agreement between her and ASUU. Let there be sincerity,” he said.
