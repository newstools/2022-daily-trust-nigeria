The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has said it will work with states in the North West and other partners to create a favourable business climate for the ease of doing business. The Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), Dr Jumoke Oduwole, stated this at the opening of the North West edition of the “Business Made Easy”, a lituation tour and enlightenment investment campaign of the council held in Dutse, the Jigawa State. She said, “Today we are in Jigawa State lituation for the North West region that includes Kano, Kaduna, Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara states to listen to the challenges of entrepreneurs, small and large scale business owners and how to improve them. “Our ease of doing business reform efforts demonstrates in clear terms our readiness to support our ambitions with all the political will available. “This tour, therefore, is aimed at ensuring that the business climate reforms being implemented align with specific and pressing needs of the entrepreneurs and business owners.” She disclosed that PEBEC had implemented over 160 reforms which had led to Nigerians being listed twice among the top most improved economies in a space of three years by the World Bank, noting however that the council would not rest on its oars. Gov Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa, in his speech, commended the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for its foresight in establishing PEBEC as a deliberate answer to the uncertain business environment prior to his assumption of office.
