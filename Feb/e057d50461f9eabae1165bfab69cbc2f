The House of Representatives is considering a legislation to compel foreign betting companies in Nigeria to pay tax. The house stated that the betting companies were making a lot of money in the country, but that there was no benefit to the country in the form of tax. The house, therefore, passed a bill for an act to amend the National Lottery Act in order to provide a framework for the enforcement of the law. The bill is titled: “A Bill for an Act to Repeal the National Lottery Act No 7, 2005 and the National Lottery (Amendment) Act No 6, 2017 and Enact the National Gaming Bill”. Speaking at the public hearing on the bill on Wednesday, the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Affairs, Akin Alabi, said, “We are talking about how foreign operators that have customers in Nigeria are not paying to Nigerian authorities. “Like one of the biggest gaming companies in the world, Bet365, anybody can go to Bet365 (online) and register and fund and start playing. “So they are making money off Nigerians but they are not paying any kobo to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).” In his opening remark, the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, who was represented by Deputy Leader of the House, Peter Akpatason, said the bill was very important and deserved a thorough consideration, debate by the parliament, as well as engagement with all stakeholders, in the best interest of the country and its people.
