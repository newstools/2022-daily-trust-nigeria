As the 2023 electioneering takes shape, a former Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has declared that the “youths are coming.” Ambode stated this amidst mixed feelings that have trailed the declaration of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for the presidency of Nigeria. Some Nigerians have raised the issue of age to disqualify Tinubu as a potential candidate for 2023. It was not clear what Ambode who has fallen out with Tinubu, has in mind when he declared his preference for the youth. In a post on his verified Twitter page, @AkinwunmiAmbode, the former Lagos governor also reiterated that power is in the hands of the youth, asking them to get their permanent voters cards. “The youths are coming. The power is in their hands. Go and get your Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) ready. Your future is NOW!”, he said. Ambode also expressed delight for the “overwhelming endorsement” of his contributions to the growth of Lagos State. “After all we have been through, God has been faithful. Thank you for the overwhelming endorsement of our modest contributions to the growth of Lagos. It can only get better for Lagos, and indeed Nigeria,” Ambode wrote. Daily Trust reports that Ambode was denied the second term ticket by the ruling APC after allegedly falling out of favour with Tinubu which paved the way for the emergence of Babajide Sanwo-Olu as then APC candidate. Ambode is yet to announce his next political move. His tweet however generated divergent views among his followers with some asking him to clarify his tweets.
