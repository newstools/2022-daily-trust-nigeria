The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kaduna State chapter, has described the Kaduna State electoral law as an instrument for electoral theft and subversion of the will of the people. This followed the failure of the local government election tribunal to deliver judgment on the 58 petitions before it until the stipulated 120 days elapsed. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna yesterday, the PDP State Chairman, Felix Hassan Hyat said, “We condemn in the strongest terms the faulty Kaduna State electoral law which was deliberately designed and signed into law by the governor to serve as an instrument for electoral theft and subversion of the will of the people.” He then demanded the immediate review of the electoral law and full participation of the public and relevant stakeholders in the process to forestall future compromise of election outcomes using the courts, as it happened in the recent case.
