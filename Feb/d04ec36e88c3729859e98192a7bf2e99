Community leaders have been urged to support the government’s effort in the education sector by ensuring that children in their domain are taken off the streets and enrolled in schools. The charge was given by the lawmaker representing Ikeja Constituency in the House of Representatives, James Faleke, when he commissioned a new block of 6 classrooms in Anifowose Primary School, Ikeja. Faleke, who noted that education is the bedrock of any development, urged community leaders to ensure that proper attention is given to grass root education for the betterment of their wards and the country. The Head Teacher of the School, Mrs Juliana Afolashade, applauded Faleke while encouraging him to provide more facilities in the school.
