The National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS) says non-effectiveness of some bills passed by the national and state assemblies on the citizenry is one of the main reasons legislators are ‘’badly misunderstood’’. The institute, while lamenting the development, said it was expedient for Nigerians to be aware that legislators are very hardworking when it comes to sound legislations to make life better for the citizenry. The Director-General of the institute, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, stated this on Monday in an interview with journalists when he formally declared open the Post Legislative Scrutiny (PLS) training organised in collaboration with Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD). Sulaiman, who was represented by NILDS Director of Democracy and Governance, Dr Adewale Aderemi, explained that PLS is a legislative process that measures the impact of legislation on the population. He said: ‘’It is one thing to pass legislation and another to know whether it is effective, serving the intended purpose of its passage. What PLS does is measure the impact of legislation on the population. ‘‘When you pass a bill into law, you have something at the back of your mind whether the law, as passed, is actually doing what you intended it to do is completely different. “PLS is important to know whether it is actually working that way or not. This is how you know whether a review is due or not.”
