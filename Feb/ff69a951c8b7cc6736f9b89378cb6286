Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), will today launch the Integrated Energy Planning Tool in the quest to significantly improve access to energy by 2030. The launch is being done in collaboration with Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), said a statement by the SEforAll Director of Communications, Sherry Kenny, adding that the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and The Rockefeller Foundation also supported the tool launch. The new data-driven, interactive platform, the statement read, will support the country’s ambition of achieving SDG7 – universal energy access – by 2030. “The Nigeria Integrated Energy Planning Tool, powered by extensive geospatial modelling and layers of data, is the first truly integrated energy planning platform that incorporates the requirements for universal residential electrification, institutional electrification, powering of productive uses, and access to clean cooking,” SEforAll stated. It will also provide energy developers and investors the data-driven information they need before entering the market and could be a blueprint for other African countries towards driving access to affordable and sustainable energy. Other global speakers at the virtual event are the United Nations (UN) Deputy Secretary General, Amina J. Mohammed; CEO, Special Representative to the UN Secretary General for Sustainable Energy for All, Damilola Ogunbiyi, and the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dr Rajiv J. Shah. Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu; Minister of State for Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba; Minister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; Managing Director (MD) of Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Ahmad Salihijo, and the Vice President for Infrastructure, World Bank, Riccardo Puliti, are also slated to grace the event.
