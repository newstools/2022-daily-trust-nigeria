Workers of Nagarta Radio in Kaduna, on Tuesday, protested over non-payment of five months’ salary arrears running from October 2021. The workers, including staff from engineering, programmes and security departments of the General Aliyu Gusau-owned radio, blocked all the station’s exit routes to press home their demand. The protest, which started around 8am, was said to have grounded activities of the station, which has a staff estimate of 45 permanent and 22 casual workers, as well as 21 artistes. Some staff, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, decried the inhuman treatment they were being subjected to by the management. The staff, who were seen holding placards with different inscriptions, accused the General Manager (GM) of station, Alhaji Abdulmalik Addy, for owing them. They described the current management of the station as incompetent and exploiting the junior staff and enriching themselves. A staff said, “We have families, we have parents and other relatives; how does the management expect us to survive, especially now that survival is very difficult even with salaries being paid?” Reacting, the GM, Alhaji Abdulmalik, said the station was being owed by various individuals, companies and government parastatals. He said, “Presently, I have started receiving alert from some individuals who were owing the station, and very soon we will commence payment of salary arrears for the five months.”
