The Lagos State Government has said it will continue to drive the conversation on tackling unemployment because it carries the burden of the entire country. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Budget, Mr Sam Ebube, however, stated that the high unemployment rate in the state was expected due to the level of migration of Nigerians into Lagos for greener pasture. He spoke at the weekend during a briefing by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) and the ministry on the second edition of the Lagos Employment Summit, a 2-day hybrid event scheduled for March 3 and 4, 2022. Themed: “Sustainable Job Creation Strategies: Collective Action and Prosperity for All”, this year’s edition of the summit will foster deliberations about progressive economic and social solutions to unemployment problems in the state. The commissioner also disclosed that the revised 30-year development plan which would soon be unveiled was aimed at “creating high value works.” He said, “So the unemployment rate of Lagos is expected because of the burden that Lagos carries on behalf of the country. It would be higher because we also have unemployment migration into Lagos. “Those coming into Lagos, a lot of them are unskilled, a lot of them unemployed, a lot of them come here because they believe that magic happens here in Lagos.” The Executive Secretary of LSETF, Mrs Teju Abisoye, stated that sustainable job creation strategies were a much-needed conversation among industry players in the entire socio-economic space. Mrs Abisoye said, “This event will spotlight various speakers with a diverse wealth of experience across the entrepreneurial, advocacy, governmental and private sectors.
