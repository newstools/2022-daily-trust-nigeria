Justice Emmanuel Ayoola of the Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun State, on Wednesday struck out a case filed against the validity of the ward, local government and state congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. The case was filed by aggrieved members of the party who are loyal to the immediate past governor of the State and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. Aregbesola’s supporters had formed a splinter group within the APC in the state under the auspices of The Osun Progressives (TOP). TOP rejected the outcome of the party congresses and took the matter to court seeking to invalidate the elections of the new executives of the party. But Justice Emmanuel Ayoola in his ruling said the suit was strictly a party affair and that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Hameed Oyegbade
