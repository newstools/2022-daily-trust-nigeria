The Transportation Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has barred tipper drivers from operating with their vehicles during peak hours on the roads. The Deputy Director, Information of the secretariat, Ughamadu Ifeanyi, told journalists that henceforth tipper operations within the FCT would not be allowed during peak hours of 6am to 10am and 3pm 9pm. Mr Ughamadu also said that within the hours of operation, all tipper drivers must ensure that the items being conveyed did not have the tendency of dispersing and disrupting other road users and that they must be properly covered with tarpaulins approved by the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS). He said this was part of the new guidelines that would govern the operations of tipper drivers in the territory. He explained that the guidelines were arrived at during a meeting of the transportation secretariat with the officials of associations of tipper drivers and the National Union of Mine Workers (NUMW) in the FCT. He further said, “All tipper drivers must ensure that the items/materials being conveyed which have tendency of dispersing or flying about must be properly covered with tarpaulins approved by the DTRS. “Defaulters of these guidelines will be sanctioned in accordance with extant laws and regulations.”
