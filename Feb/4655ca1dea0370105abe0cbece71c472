Bayelsa State government has signed an agreement with a consortium comprising Zipline Global Leaders, Sterling Bank, Health Spaces and DrugStoc for the Bayelsa Health Supply Chain Transformation Project (BHSCTP). The project is aimed at using drone technology to supply drugs to the hospitals in the state, especially those areas that are not accessible by road. The project, estimated at $5million to be provided by the firms, is expected to provide a 21st-century supply system and other supply chains using drone technology in the distribution of cost- effective pharmaceuticals in the state. Speaking during the MoU signing yesterday in Yenagoa, Governor Douye Diri charged the stakeholders in the project to ensure that it comes on stream to boost distribution of pharmaceuticals, particularly in remote communities in the state. He identified access to healthcare as a major challenge and urged the consortium to deploy the technology to create access for residents in far-flung communities. He said: “We would like to see the drones fly to Koluama, Korokorosei, Egbemo-Angalabiri and to every nook and cranny of the state to solve the issue of access to pharmaceutical products.” Also speaking, the Zipline Senior Vice President (Africa), Daniel Marfo, explained that Zipline and the other two firms were coming together to provide a supply chain that is adaptive, resilient and serves the health needs of the people in the area of health product distribution. He said the project is a $5million investment by the consortium members to improve access to healthcare, adding that products could be provided within 30 minutes upon request.
