Factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State, Dr. Haroun Ogbonnia Ajah, has led members of his team to a meeting with the APC national reconciliation committee in Abuja. Speaking to members of the committee on Thursday during the meeting, Ajah explained how he and others worked for and sustained the party before the defection of David Umahi, the Governor of the state. He said that Governor Umahi wants to completely shut the founding fathers of the party out from the party through imposition of his cronies. The Chairman of the committee, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, promised to give all a fair hearing.
