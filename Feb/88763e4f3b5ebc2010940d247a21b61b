The Lagos State government has reviewed the roadworthiness system recently introduced by unveiling a booking system to stem the surge recorded at some vehicle inspection centres. This followed the assessment of the ‘No Vehicle Inspection, No Road Worthiness Certificate’ Policy which commenced in January 2022. The government also disclosed that out of 26,442 that were inspected in January, 15,998 passed, while 10,444 failed the minimum safety standard tests. Daily Trust reports that the new policy, which replaced the old system where motorists obtained roadworthiness certificates without submitting their vehicles for inspection, has attracted several complaints from motorists. Many motorists especially lamented the long hours of waiting at the vehicle inspection centres. But the state Ministry of Transportation in response to the widespread complaints explained that with the new amendment, the procedure of processing roadworthiness certificate in the state will now be based on scheduled appointments. The Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, revealed that the 30-day window of inspection period has been reviewed to 60 days to reduce panic surge presently seen in some of the inspection test centres. It added that the backlog of already referred vehicles will be cleared between now and February 14 to give room for the booking system. Oladeinde also disclosed that the state government is ramping up consultation with private partners with vehicle inspection facilities to increase the existing 27 centres spread across the state, with five more mobile test centres already on the way. Applauding motorists who have submitted to the inspection at the Lagos State Computerised Centres across the state, the commissioner noted that out of 26,442 that were inspected in January, 15,998 passed, while 10,444 failed the minimum safety standard tests.
