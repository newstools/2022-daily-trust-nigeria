 A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill, has said he and other stakeholders of the party across the country have started consulting for the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, as the best man to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Princewill, a former governorship candidate of Action Congress (AC) in the state, told newsmen in Port Harcourt, the state capital, at the weekend that Amaechi has enough energy to work hard for the development of the country. He said, “Amaechi is very stubborn for results. He does not take ‘no’ for an answer. He goes for results and he has always gotten results in anything he sets his eyes for. “Amaechi took over the moribund railway industry and transformed it into something that we all can be proud of as a people. He may not remember friendship when he becomes president because he needs results that would make Nigerians happy. “I am not saying this because Amaechi is from my state or region. I know for a fact that Nigeria needs Amaechi who has enough energy to work for the good of this country. He understands the politics of this country and knows how to tackle our multi-faceted problems.”
