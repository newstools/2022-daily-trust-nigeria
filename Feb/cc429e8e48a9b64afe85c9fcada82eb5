The Atiku Support Organisation (ASO) has called on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to give its presidential ticket to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, saying he is the most prepared aspirant in the country. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday, Akinze Moze, Director, ASO said Nigerians have tried a man of integrity and it is now time to try Atiku whom he describes as a man of prosperity. Moze, flanked by other group leaders under the auspices of the ASO, said “Nigeria is at a precipice and needs a messiah to inspire the kind of confidence that Nigerians need to remain hopeful and steadfast in the face of despondency.” He said they are clamouring for an Atiku presidency in 2023 because no politician in Nigeria’s history has invested in preparing himself for the office of the president of Nigeria, as much as Atiku has. “Over the last three decades, Atiku has invested in businesses that have impacted the lives of thousands of people,” he said.
