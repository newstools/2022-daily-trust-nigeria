The National Youth Service Corps Foundation (NYSCF) has concluded plans to set up a platform, “Zigzag Nation”, where corps members can save money and as well get loans for business. Speaking yesterday in Abuja during a press briefing, the Executive Secretary of the foundation, Barr Ventim Bako, said the platform was to afford corps members the opportunity to imbibe the culture of saving during and after their service year, noting that the savings would attract some interest. He explained that every interested corps member was expected to save at least N5,000 and a Zigzag Mastercard would be provided for them. He further said corps members could access loans of up to N100,000 to support their businesses or to address immediate needs within their service year, noting that the loan could be repaid daily, weekly or monthly. Bako explained that a minimum saving period of four months was required to access the loan. He said Zigzag Nation was backed up by Fullrange Microfinance Bank (FRMFB) and Access Bank which were licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
