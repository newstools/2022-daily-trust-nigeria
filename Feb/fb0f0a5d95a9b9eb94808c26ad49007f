Stakeholders of the APC across the country have been urged to support the candidature of Niger State senator, Sani Musa, for the national chairmanship seat of the party. The coordinator of Joint APC Stakeholders, Umar Waziri Kumo, in a statement, said talks and mobilization of delegates and influential party bigwigs were on to rally support for the Niger East senator to emerge as the next elected national chairman of APC. Kumo added that the party was trying hard to avoid repeating mistakes of the past, particularly that of taking the sensibilities of Nigerians for granted. He explained further that party stakeholders had agreed not to fall into the pothole that became the nemesis of the previous party in power.
