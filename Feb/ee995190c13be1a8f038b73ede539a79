The Ila Federal Constituency on Tuesday endorsed Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for a second term and assured him of the people’s votes in the Saturday primary election of the party. The endorsement meeting was held at the residence of the former national interim national chairman of the APC, Chief Adebisi Akande at Ila-Orangun. The leadership and members of the APC in Ila Federal Constituency, comprising Ila, Ifedayo and Boluwaduro LGAs, passed a vote of confidence on the Oyetola-led government in the state. Reading the communiqué of the meeting, the Deputy Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Femi Popoola, said the leadership and members of the party endorsed the governor for a second term in office, having monitored, evaluated and reviewed his remarkable performance in the last three years. But the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Aregbesola, has insisted that Oyetola would not be allowed to run on the platform of the APC. He urged members of APC in the state to vote for the former secretary to the state government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, in the primary election of the party on Saturday. Aregbesola said he had stomached betrayal, hypocrisy and backsliding from the people he was serving wholeheartedly, apparently referring to the APC leader and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu. Aregbesola said he decided to take a new path when he realised that the person he was loyal to (Tinubu) was out to destroy him and everything he stand for. He urged members of the party to vote for Adeoti in the Saturday primary election of the party.
