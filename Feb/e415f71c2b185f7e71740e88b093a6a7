An organisation focused on skills training, Klinic, has concluded arrangements to organise an eight-week free entrepreneurship/skills training for residents of Makoko, a popular slum in Lagos State; beginning from the last week of February. Makoko is a floating fishing village located in Yaba, Lagos. The community is arguably the biggest fishing community in Lagos, but it is characterised by lack of basic social amenities such as: electricity, quality education, and healthcare facilities among others. As part of measures to liberate the people from poverty, Head of Operations at Klinic, Rahman Olamide Shittu, explained that the community will benefit from eight weeks of Medicare, charity donations and training in vocational skills.
