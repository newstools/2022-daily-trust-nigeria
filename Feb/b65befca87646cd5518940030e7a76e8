Custodian Investment Plc, a diversified non-bank financial institution, has reported that its gross revenue increased by 14 percent to N85.5 billion in 2021 despite the challenging environment. The company, which disclosed this in its unaudited result for the year ended 31st December 2021, added that after adjusting for non-recurring one-time gain from the prior year’s result, profits from continuing ordinary operations recorded 18 per cent growth. The result also showed that the Custodian Group’s shareholders’ fund grew by 14 per cent from N47.6bn to N54.3bn after paying dividends totaling N3.24 bn or 55k per share during the year. Speaking on the result, the company’s Group Managing Director, Mr Wole Oshin, said the result can be attributed to the resilience of the Group, the diversity of its product offerings, the commitment of its staff and the unwavering support of its Board of Directors. He expects the incremental contribution that will flow in from the Group’s real estate business segment, which is being restructured, to boost the fortunes of the company.
