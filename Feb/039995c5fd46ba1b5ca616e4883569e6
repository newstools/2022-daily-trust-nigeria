President Muhammadu Buhari has opened the 43rd Kaduna International Trade Fair organised by the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA). The fair, which is described as Africa’s most famous, is aimed at bringing the public and private sector together to promote the ease of doing business in the country. Speaking at the fair, President Buhari who was represented by the Minister of Trade and Investment, Otunba Adebayo, reiterated federal government’s commitment in partnering with the private sector in realising its vision of a strong and resilient economy. He said, “The recent COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant effects on crude oil prices, foreign exchange and investment inflows has shown that there is need to urgently reconsider and modify the thinking on investment led by comparative advantage only in order to guarantee Nigeria’s economic security.” On his part, the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, who was represented by the commissioner for business, innovation and technology, Prof Kabiru Mato, commended KADCCIMA for the annual event, which he said would provide opportunities to companies to showcase their products to boost the state’s economy. He said the state had been making deliberate efforts in the empowerment of youths and women.
