Some parts of Ibadan City in Oyo State on Wednesday witnessed unusual gridlock due to the prevailing scarcity of fuel across the country. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the gridlock caused by heavy presence of car owners in many filling stations visited in the town, left many commuters stranded. Commenting, a businessman, Mr Mayowa Oluyinka, said that the situation became chaotic as most of the filling stations were not dispensing the product to motorists who were on queue. “Some of the filling stations don’t have fuel while others are just hoarding the product till it becomes very expensive to buy,” Oluyinka said. Another motorist, Mr Sanmi Olatunde, said he queued for about 30 minutes before he could get the fuel in the town.
