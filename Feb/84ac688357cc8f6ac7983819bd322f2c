Air Peace has concluded plans to resume direct scheduled flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 1, 2022. The announcement is coming a few days after the federal government and the UAE reopened flights between the two countries after resolving a diplomatic spat over a Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA).  The airline is also set to expand its West coast presence by launching flight operations into Niamey, Niger, on February 25, 2022, as well as Kinshasa and Malabo in Quarter 1, 2022. In a statement Tuesday, the airline said the Lagos-Dubai-Lagos flights would operate three days weekly from any of its domestic routes through its Lagos hub. “We are happy to inform the flying public that in tandem with our commitment to providing more flight connectivity and meeting the air travel needs of Nigerians, we are restarting our UAE operations, but with Dubai as the destination and not Sharjah. “We abundantly appreciate the vital role played by the Nigerian government in making this possible,” Air Peace stated. The airline further stated that before the end of the first quarter of this year it would commence scheduled flights to Kinshasa in DR Congo and Malabo in Equatorial Guinea “to enlarge our footprints in West Africa and offer the flying public more network options”, adding that Niamey flights would operate from Abuja and Kano on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays with Hopper jets. Air Peace, which has been operating scheduled commercial flights into the UAE since July, 2019, added that it would continue to scale up its service delivery to surpass the expectations of air travellers, especially with the activation of its ambitious fleet modernisation scheme and a renewed commitment to unequalled customer experience.
