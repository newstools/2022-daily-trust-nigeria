Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has said he has no presidential ambition in the 2023 elections, promising to back any presidential candidate that emerges from any of the geo-political zones in the South. The governor said this Thursday while fielding questions from State House reporters during the weekly briefing organised by the Presidential Communication Media Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. El-Rufai, who also expressed his wish to have a successor within his “team”, said the people of Kaduna State would eventually take the decision as he could not anoint any candidate. He said he was “more concerned about succession in Kaduna State than the next president of Nigeria.” He said, “I have some preferences for people who will succeed me. I have zero ambition. I just want to finish this job, get on with my private life, write another book, and make tons of money. “The largest amount of money I ever got in my life was from writing ‘Accidental Public Servant’. I have no ambition; I’ve never had any ambition.”
