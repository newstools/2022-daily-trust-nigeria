The Kwara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, to rise above petty politics over his comments on the politics of the state. The party, in a statement on Monday signed by its publicity secretary, Tunde Ashaolu, expressed disappointment with the Senate president over his blanket commendation for Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq on his performance in the last 32 months. Lawan, during a mega empowerment by the senator representing Kwara North in the National Assembly, Umar Sadiq held in Ilorin, had chided the party that it had little to show for the 16 years it had ruled the state. He also called for the reelection of the governor in 2023. But PDP said Lawan’s understanding of what constitutes good governance is “too low, warped, pedestrian and archaic”. It queried him to explain what informed his judgment about the good performance of Abdulrazaq when he (Lawan) did not inspect any completed or ongoing project or policy initiative by the government during the visit. Several calls to get the response of spokesman of the Senate President, Ola Awoniyi, were not answered.
