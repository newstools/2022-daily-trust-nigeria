A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Nasarawa State under the leadership of Hon. Sidi Bako has appealed to the Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to intervene in the crisis rocking the state chapter of the party. This was contained in a statement jointly signed by the Keffi LGA branch chairman and secretary, Hon. Mohammed Lawal Adamu and Hassan Abdullahi, made available to newsmen in Keffi. The faction lamented that the crisis persisted despite effort by Senator Bukola Saraki-led National Reconciliation Committee to resolve it. According to the statement, the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) chairman, Senator Walid Jibril, Senator Solomon Ewuga, Hon. Usman Bagudu, Hon. Ogoshi Onawa, Hon. Yonana Iliya, Alhaji Yusuf Ayitogo and Hon. Obamas were delegated to settle the contentious issues but no meaningful result was achieved. The faction said it wanted a consensus to be adopted within the two factions of Hon Francis Orugo and Hon. Sidi Bako to produce credible leaders but the Orugo faction was not been co-operating. “We are appealing that all the things that we have stated above should be looked into for the fact that we are PDP loyalists,” they said.
