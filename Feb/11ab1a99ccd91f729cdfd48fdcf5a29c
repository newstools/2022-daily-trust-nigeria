A younger brother to the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Yusuf Sulu-Gambari, has declared his interest to contest the Ilorin East/Ilorin South federal constituency seat come 2023 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking with newsmen after he presented his letter of intent to the PDP leadership at his Balogun Fulani ward 1 and state party secretariat, Sulu-Gambari who is planning to replace AbdulGaniyu Cook Olododo, said past occupants were under-utilizing the slot. He further encouraged the electorate to obtain their PVCs, adding that it remained the only weapon with which to elect the opposition party back to power. “It’s very obvious that the last election defeat of the PDP was not as a result of the APC popularity or acceptability among our people. It’s just that God wanted us to learn lesson. which we’ve learnt,” he said.
