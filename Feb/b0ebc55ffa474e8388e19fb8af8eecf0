A Kaduna magistrates’ court has ordered a trader, Usman Khalid, to sweep the court’s premises for 30 days for stealing two air conditioners. Khalid (34) was convicted and sentenced after he pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy and theft. The magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, did not give the convict an option of fine, and warned him to desist from committing crime and be a law abiding citizen. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Chidi Leo, told the court that one Malam Bello Haruna of Malali Kaduna reported the matter at the Gabasawa Police Station on February 8; that Khalid and two others, now at large, trespassed into his compound and stole two air conditioners worth N180,000.
