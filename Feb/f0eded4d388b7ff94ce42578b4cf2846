A former Commandant of the National Defence College, Abuja, Rear Admiral Thomas Lokoson (retd), and over 5000 other faithful of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State. Lokoson, who hails from the Southern Ijaw Local government area of the state, said that he returned to the PDP, his former party because of the quality of trust that Governor Diri had demonstrated in his leadership style in the state.
