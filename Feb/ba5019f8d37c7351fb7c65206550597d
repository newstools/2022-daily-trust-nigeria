Kinsmen of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in Remo Kingdom in Ogun State have called on the Akarigbo and paramount ruler of the kingdom, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, to prevail on him to declare his intention for the 2023 presidential race. Osinbajo hails from Ikenne in Remoland. The kinsmen, comprising youths, women, traders and experienced politicians from all wards in Remoland, yesterday embarked on a rally in Sagamu, calling on Osinbajo to declare for president. They carried placards with various inscriptions, such as, ‘We want PYO as President’, ‘Prof Yemi Osinbajo Man of the people for 2023’, ‘Women ask Osinbajo to run’ among others. The kinsmen, after the street rally, headed to the Akarigbo’s palace and handed the first-class monarch a letter to be presented to Osinbajo on their request to make himself available for the contest. Leader of the group under the auspices of PYO for President John Obafemi told Akarigbo at the palace that despite overwhelming support and call on the vice president to throw his hat into the ring, he was yet to do so. Responding, the Akarigbo promised to deliver the letter to Osinbajo who he described as one of the best brains from the kingdom.
