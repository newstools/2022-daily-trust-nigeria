Former local government chairmen under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Jigawa State have called on the son of a former governor of the state, Sule Lamido, Mustapha, to seek the party’s 2023 gubernatorial ticket. The group, under the aegis of the Forum of former Local Government Chairmen under PDP, made the call in a communiqué it issued during its extraordinary meeting at Gumel Foundation in Gumel north-west, Jigawa. Reading the communiqué, the secretary of the forum and a former chairman of Yankwashi LGA, Musa Abdullahi Karkarna, said 22 out of the 27 local government chairmen who served under the PDP attended the meeting and agreed on the resolution. Mustapha, who is yet to declare for the race, is among the three persons eyeing PDP ticket in the state. The group said it would go round the state to mobilise more people, particularly PDP members, to join it and mount pressure on Mustapha to accept their request.
