The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, has blamed inspection failure for the adulterated petrol issue and the scarcity that has followed. In a statement at the weekend, the minister said the federal government regretted the circumstances. He said, “In the last weeks, Nigerians have grappled with fuel scarcity, not because of the absence of supply of products but due to inspection failure, which allowed adulterated products into the country. “This is regrettable, and the federal government sympathizes with the citizenry over the unforeseen hardship, occasioned by the inevitable scarcity. “Let me once again appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the government in finding lasting solutions to the crisis.” In the statement issued by his senior adviser on media and communication, Horatius Egua Sylva, further appreciated NNPC Ltd for showing so much concern to the plight of Nigerians by coming forward with an apology. “This is unprecedented and shows that we on the government side are not afraid to take responsibility. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has been out on the streets, filling station by filling station to ensure that the situation normalizes quickly and we are beginning to see the fruits of their efforts.”
