The Director-General of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, has lamented that limited funding opportunities for trainees who have undergone the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) were part of the challenges encountered by the Scheme. Speaking on Monday in Abuja at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Batch A Pre-Orientation Course workshop, Ibrahim also noted that inadequate facilities in some of the orientation camps, inadequate training materials for the SAED programme were also a challenge. He insisted that if the National Youth Service Corps Trust Fund (NYSCTF) gets established, it would help address the infrastructural deficit in the orientation camps and ensure adequate provision of other operational logistics as well as the problem of graduate unemployment by making our skill and entrepreneurship training programme more functional. Ibrahim noted that a number of ex-trainees of the SAED programme have established flourishing businesses in several states across the country and have either employed or trained many youths of the host communities. He said when the NYSC Trust Fund becomes operational, the number of corps entrepreneurs will increase drastically, and they will in turn help to provide jobs for millions of other youths of the country. He added that the consideration of the Bill for the Trust Fund was making progress, having passed the second reading at the House of Representatives and a public hearing on it fixed for February 24.
