A police sergeant, Adeleke Ogunsola, has reportedly died while opening the main gate of the Asoludero, Sagamu, residence of a former governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel. Sgt Ogunsola was one of the police officers posted to Daniel’s house for security. It was gathered that Ogunsola was opening the gate for Daniel’s driver when the gate’s panel fell and while he was shifting back was knocked down by the former governor’s driver. The policeman was rushed to a hospital where he eventually died. The police spokesman in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, saying, “That was an accident. He was opening the gate, the gate bounced back and the driver mistakenly hit him with the gate. It’s an accident, it can happen to anybody.” When contacted, the media aide to Gbenga Daniel, Steve Oliyide, promised to get back to our reporter, but was yet to do so at the time of filing this report.
