The Lagos State Government has lifted the suspension earlier placed on the Removal of Abandoned Vehicles Committee (RAVC) ad hoc operation in the state. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Hon Oluwatoyin Fayinka, explained that the decision was reached after a thorough appraisal and review of the operational guidelines of the team in accordance with the laws of the state as captured in the Traffic Sector Reform Law (TSRL) 2018. It would be recalled that the committee was suspended after an outcry from members of the public on its activities. Hon Fayinka, however, stated that RAVC would be back better and stronger having gone through professional training for the discharge of its duties on the removal of stationary and abandoned vehicles which posed environmental nuisance, security and traffic impediments. He reiterated that the creation of the committee was mainly for the removal of stationary and abandoned vehicles on highways and inner roads across Lagos State to reduce traffic for the motoring public. He noted that some artisans had turned roads into their workshops, repairing vehicles on the roads, loading and unloading on the roads without due consideration for other road users.
