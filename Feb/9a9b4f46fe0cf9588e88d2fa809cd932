President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday received two governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The governors were Senator Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State who doubles as the Chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) and Muhammad Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State. The two governors met the president as the APC prepares for February 26 National Convention where a new set of members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) would be elected. Last Thursday, the party inaugurated its state executives ahead of the convention. Aspirants have been campaigning across the country for the position of the national chairman. Various camps have been meeting to secure the victory for their preferred as-pirants as the President remains quiet on his preferred candidates for the posi-tions of national chairman and president ahead of the 2023 general elections. Meanwhile, the party has inaugurated a forum of all councillors elected on its platform to begin mobilisation of support for the party at the grassroots. The councillors, under the auspices of National Progressive Councilors’ Forum (NPCF), led by the councillor representing Guringawa ward in Kumbotso Local Government of Kano State, Muslihu Yusuf Ali, were inaugurated by the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the party, Mai Mala Buni. Buni, who was represented by the Director Organising of APC, Alhaji Alpha Yahaya, charged the newly inaugurated NPCF executive, to assist the party in its growth and ideology to be acceptable within all communities. He said, “We know all politics is local, and we understand that the main politics is at the grassroots, that is why we can’t joke with councillors. Your objective is to assist the party (APC) in its growth and ideology of its acceptability within our community.” In his reaction, the chairman of NPCF, Ali, said they would not let the party down in its quest to register in the minds of people at the local level.
