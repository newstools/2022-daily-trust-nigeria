The National Forum for South-East Presidency (NFSEP) has denied endorsing a former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okoroch, for president. Okorocha recently declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) after which he was said to have been endorsed by the group. But arising from a one-day national conference in Awka, the Anambra State capital, the group said it has not endorsed any candidate for the 2023 general polls. President of the forum, Dr. Patrick Enuneku, who addressed newsmen at the end of their meeting said, “The visit to our senator was among the hundred and one visits we had made to various states of the federation. “We wonder why we should endorse him even before the declarations of other presidential aspirants from the region.”
