Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has said electing a young, vibrant and well-educated president in the 2023 general election is the best option for Nigeria. The governor stated this when he received the advocacy team of The Nigeria Agenda in Minna, the Niger State capital, on Wednesday. Governor Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, said “To achieve this, all political parties are enjoined to make sure only young, vibrant and educated candidates emerged on their respective platforms. “This has become important because of the need to deliberately tap into the large population of young Nigerians that are highly educated, vibrant and have impressive records of experience in government, and capable of unlocking the potential of the country for rapid social and physical development.” A statement by the Chief Advocate of the TNA, Niyi Akinsiju, said the governor expressed his support and enthusiasm for the issues and values being canvassed by the advocacy team of The Nigeria Agenda. The convener of The Nigeria Agenda, Malam Ahmad Sajoh, urged Nigerians to imbibe values that strengthen national unity, cross-ethnic and religious bonding and good neighbourliness.
