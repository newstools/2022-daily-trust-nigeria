Ahead of the FIBA Women’s World Cup Qualifiers in Serbia, the factional president of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), Igoche Mark, has charged D’Tigress to make the country proud by putting up excellent performances. As a form of motivation, the factional president also promised that his board will sooner than later offset the backlog of bonuses and allowances owed the girls by the past board under Musa Kida. He said the welfare of the girls is a top priority of his newly constituted NBBF board. “D’Tigress, this is to wish you all the best as you go to make Nigeria proud once again in Serbia at the World Cup Qualifiers. “Our prayers are with you. I want you to be rest assured that the ‘New Face of Basketball’ has come to stay. We have heard your appeal and we are going to handle all your genuine concerns. “Your outstanding debts are going to be paid as soon as possible. We are working on it but for now, please go and make us proud,” the initiator and sponsor of the ongoing Mark D Ball men’s championship in Abuja.
