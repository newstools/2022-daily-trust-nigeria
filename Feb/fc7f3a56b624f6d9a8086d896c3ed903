Legal practitioners under the aegis of International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) on Tuesday took to the Kano streets to condemn and demand an end to child rights abuse that become rampant recently in the state. The women lawyers made specific reference to the gruesome murder of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, reportedly by her school proprietor, Abdulmalik Tanko, as well as thousands of other cases of child rights abuse they said is going on in the state. The organization therefore called for the quick assent to the Child Right Act by the state House of Assembly and the state government. The chairperson of FIDA in Kano, Barrister Bilkisu Ibrahim Sulaiman, said the protest was to beg and call the attention of the government and all other stakeholders to ensure justice for the children now and in the future. “Anybody in Kano that has a stake in this issue should please do all the needful to ensure that the Child Right Act is passed into law in Kano. It is the only thing that has adequate provisions to save the children from what is happening presently,” she said. She added that other reasons for the protest was how the culprits that undertake several child abuse are left unpunished which give them chances to do more of the bad act. “If these people are not punished, definitely they will continue to destroy the future of our children. And only the Child Rights Act provides for appropriate punishment that is aimed at ending the menace,’’ she said.
