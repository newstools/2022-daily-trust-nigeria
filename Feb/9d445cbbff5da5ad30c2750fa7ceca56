There was excitement among learners, educators, and community members when Nestlé commissioned Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities at the All-Saints Primary School, Owode-Egba in Ogun State. The facilities, which are expected to serve over 500 individuals within the community, are part of the company’s commitment to enhancing the quality of life and building thriving communities closest to its operations. The newly commissioned project, which consists of a water facility, hand washing section, modern toilet and generator to pump water, brings the total number of Nestlé-donated community WASH facilities in Ogun State to 14. The intervention aims to give more children access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. Nestlé Nigeria’s Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Victoria Uwadoka, who spoke at the commissioning of the facilities said: “We recognise the fact that water and sanitation are essential to life and well-being. They are, therefore, at the core of improving livelihood in any community. “We want to ensure that no child is left out of the WASH facility.” In his remarks at the commissioning, the Board Chairperson of Ogun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Dr Femi Majekodunmi, commended Nestle for its continuous support while he called on the staff of the school, parents and the students to judiciously utilise the facilities and ensure that they are well secured and preserved for continuous use. Nestlé Nigeria has also introduced NESCAFÉ MALTY, a new blend of coffee and malt in the NESCAFÉ 3in1 coffee options which deliver a rich, bold and enjoyable taste to satisfy consumer preferences. At the launch of the new NESCAFÉ Malty 3in1 in Lagos, the Managing Director and CEO of Nestlé Nigeria PLC, Mr Wassim Elhusseini, said the company is focused on unlocking the power of food to enhance the quality of life for everyone today and for generations to come.
