The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State Thursday boycotted an event meant for the signing a peace pact ahead of this Saturday’s by-election for Jos North/Bassa federal constituency and Pankshin South state constituency of the state. The peace pact was signed among political parties, security agencies, religious and traditional leaders among other stakeholders. The event took place at the Dialogue, Reconciliation and Peace (DREP) Centre in Kwang Jos, the state capital. PDP, which is the leading opposition party in the state, did not participate in the exercise and no reason for the party’s absence was given. It, however, held a rally yesterday at the Polo field to canvass support for its candidates in the by-elections, where all the party’s bigwigs in the state including its national chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, attended.
